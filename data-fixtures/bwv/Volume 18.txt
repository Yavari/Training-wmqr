PREFACE

  THE successive volumes of The Baha'i World have come to be anticipated by Baha'is as the record of their own collective endeavours on behalf of their Faith, of the establishment and development of its administrative order throughout the world and as the source of data, both historical and statistical, relating to the rise of that Faith during its formative age. 

 By librarians and students The Baha'i World is becoming ever more widely known as a source of authentic information about the aims, tenets, history, activities, organization and growth of the Baha'i Faith. The editors therefore have always in mind the preservation of an even balance between the presentation of material of supreme interest to believers and of a fair and objective picture to enquirers. In this they are guided by the policy of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha Faith, who directed the compilation of the successive volumes from I to XII covering the years 1925 to 1954. The first volume, known as Baha'i Year Book; was in fact a one-year survey; the next seven volumes were biennial, terminating in 1940; volume IX recorded the four years from 1940 to 1944; volume X was again biennial and volumes XI and XII presented the periods 1946 to 1950 and 1950 to 1954 respectively. All these volumes were published in the United States under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly and the supervision of the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. Volume XIII, which recorded the passing of the Guardian and the course and completion of his Ten Year Crusade, covered the entire period from 1954 to 1963 and was produced under the supervision of the Universal House of Justice, which thenceforth assumed responsibility for publication. Volumes XIV, XV, XVI and XVII covered the years 1963 to 1968, 1968 to 1973, 1973 to 1976 and 1976 to 1979 respectively. 

 This volume, relating to the years 1979 to 1983, records the observance in the Hoiy Land in July 1982 of the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of The Greatest Holy Leaf, eldest daughter of Baha'u'llah and 'the outstanding heroine of the Baha Dispensation'; ; the successful completion of the first stage of the restoration of the House of 'Abdu'lHh Phsh6 and its opening to pilgrims; the completion of construction of the permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice and its occupation by that Institution in January 1983; the holding in the Holy Land in May 1983 of the fifth International Convention; the progress made towards construction of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Indian Subcontinent in New Delhi and of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Pacific Islands in Samoa; the holding in 1982 of five International Conferences dedicated to the Greatest Holy Leaf and marking the fiftieth anniversary of her passing; the progress made in the Seven Year global teaching plan inaugurated at Ridvan 1979 and constituting yet another stage in the unfoldment of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan; and the resumption in lr~n on a scale unprecedented in recent history of a campaign designed to extirpate the Baha'i Faith from the land of its birth through the systematic imprisonment and execution of its leaders, the expropriation, desecration and destruction of its holy places, and the persecution and harassment of its rank and file, a process which, to an extent never before witnessed, drew the sympathetic attention of governments, world leaders and the mass media to the true nature of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah and publicized its teachings.

INTRODUCTION

              AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE
                    BAHA'I FAITH

                    DAVID HOFMAN

  RELIGION has two objectives, the regeneration  of men and the advancement of mankind.  All men have been created to carry forward  an ever advancing civilization proclaims Baha'u'llah, and The purpose of the one true God, exalted be His glory, in revealing Himself unto men is to lay bare those gems that lie hidden  within the mine of their true and inmost selves. 

 These aims of religion, universal and eternal, nevertheless have been conditioned to the capacities of each age or dispensation and the great religions of the past have developed their social orders within generally definable times and areas. Judaism, for instance, attained its peak under Solomon and was confined, before the dispersion, to the Near East; Zoroastrianism remained Persian until the Arab conquest and the settlement of a remnant in Western India; Christianity became the religion of European civilization; the building of the nation state undertaken by Isldm remained a Muslim experiment until feudal Europe learned the lesson and its city states gave way to and adopted the more advanced order. 

 It has remained for the Baha'i religion to declare and promote the cause of world oider — the sine qua non of its existence — and to disclose the concomitant unities of religion, of mankind and of historical purpose. 'Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been successively  attempted and fully established. World unity is the goal towards which a harassed  humanity is striving. Nation-buiLding has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. 

 A world, growing to maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and establish once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its life." 

 Religion sees the course of history as an organic process, moving towards the full realization of all the potentialities implanted in man. The vicissitudes, the great advances, the hiatuses it regards as the natural unfoldment of that process just as the succession of bud, leaf, flower and fruit is the natural unfoldment in the life of a tree; or infancy, childhood, youth and maturity in that of a man. Indeed, Baha'i scripture  explains, the process is the same. 

 The sun is the effective agent in the organic life of the earth; r~Iigion in that of humanity. 

 The Sun of Truth is the Word of God upon which depends the education of those who are endowed with the power of understanding and of utterance.2 The creative Word, revealed in each stage of human progress by a Manifestation of God, and conditioned to the requirements of the time, is the effective agent in the long, single process of humanity's development from infancy to World Order. This truth is enshrined in all revealed religion although it needs the illumination of Baha'u'llah's revelation to enable men to perceive it. 'The first picture presented in the Bible is that of human unity in its simplest form; that of a single fami1y~ The last picture is that of a unity manifold and universal in which all kindreds and tongues and peoples and nations are gathered into one and unified in the enjoyment of-a common worship, a common happiness, a common glory.

2                  THE BAHAI WOP~LD

  Bible, confronts the human race in its progress is that of advancing from the barest, baldest unity through a long experience of multiplying diversities till ultimately a balance between the two principles is struck, poise is gained and the two forces of variety and unity are blended in a multiple, highly developed world fellowship, the perfection of whose union was hardly suggested  in the primitive simplicity of early man.'1 This spiritual view of evolution is the constant theme of religion. Each revelation refers to the past, looks forward to the future and concentrates upon the immediate need for spiritual regeneration and enlightenment. The Prophet evokes in human hearts a sacrificial love which transcends self-interest and causes the early believers to dedicate themselves entirely to the practice and diffusion of the new message. As it spreads it works like leaven in society, reforming its morals, uplifting its vision  and promoting a greater diffusion of love in social action. 

 'World history at its core and in its essence is the story of the spiritual evolution of mankind. From this all other activities of man proceed and round it all other activities revolve.'2 Unlike the revelations of the past, the Baha'i revelation releases not only the creative Word necessary to the renewal of spiritual vitality in the human spirit, but embodies that divine energy in an administrative order capable of bringing within its shade all the diversified ethnic groups and myriad types of the human race, who may find within its wide embrace a full, happy and purposeful life. 

 Baha'i activity therefore is directed not oniy, as in the past, to the spreading of the Word, but to the establishment of the fabric of that Order which, enshrined within the creative Word itself, becomes the chief instrument for the further diffusion and social application of the Divine Message. 

 This World Order, which the Baha'i Faith'exists to establish, is none other than that long-promised Kingdom in which peace, justice  and brotherhood shall prevail universally and 'the earth shall be filled with the knowledge  of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.'3 The establishment of this World Order is dependent upon the regenera-'George

of the Gospel, 1939.      

  2 ibid.

 tion of mankind which must turn again to God and recognize His purpose. 

 The two aims of religion are, therefore, interacting and interdependent. 

 Such a world-shaking transformation cannot be brought about by any movement of reform, however disinterested, nor by any unaided human effort. 

 Modern man has turned away from God, and bereft of his traditional sanctions, has inevitably wrecked his old order which, in truth, is lamentably inadequate to modern conditions and is not susceptible of repair. Soon, is Baha'u'llah's prophetic view of our day, will the presentday order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead. Likewise, The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably defective. 

 The current aim of religion, embodied in the aims and purposes of the Baha'i Faith, is the promotion of the next stage in the organic process  of human evolution — the coming of age of the human race. 

 The achievement of this maturity will be attested by the unification of mankind and the federation of the world in a single, all-embracing world society of human brotherhood. 

 But great objectives are reached by dedicated pursuit of the preliminary and intermediate stages of the task, without ever losing sight of the ultimate goal, and this has been and is now the occupation of the Baha'i world community — the completion within specified times of specified goals. These teaching  plans to which the Baha'is eagerly devote their lives do far more than simply increase the size and consolidation of that world community. 

 They are devised and launched by the head of the Faith — the Guardian and now the Universal House of Justice — and are therefore conceived from a global view, directed to the immediate needs of the great objective, conservative  of the community's resources, worldwide in scale permitting the organic development of each part according to its stage of growth but with due regard for the needs of the whole, fostering intensively the unity, the international cooperation, the diversification of the ethnic, religious and social backgrounds of its increasing membership and developing new resources for the next step forward. 

 It should be noted that none of these plans is isolated in aim or conception but all are directed towards the implementation of three

  great charters, enshrined in Baha'i sacred Writings, which authorize and guide the expansion of the Faith and the development of its institutions.  In past Dispensations the command to 'spread the Gospel' has been general and unspecified. It was the inspired guidance of the beloved Guardian of the Baha'i Faith which disclosed to a spiritually delighted and grateful community yet another of the unique features of this Dispensation in the specific guidance given in these three charters for the implementation of this eternal command. 

 Baha'u'llah's Tablet of Carmel is the charter for the development of the Baha'i World Centre in the twin cities of 'Akka and Haifa, the site of its most sacred Shrines — the tombs of the twin Prophets and of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Centre of the Covenant — its monuments and gardens, and of its 'world-shaking, world-embracing,  world-directing administrative institutions'.1 

   The Will and Testament     

 of 'Abdu'l-Baha is the charter for the development of the administrative order of the Faith. In this majestic document, the child of 'that mystic intercourse between Him Who communicated the generating  influence of His divine Purpose and the One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient,'2 are delineated the structure of the administrative order, its modus operandi, its main institutions, the chain of authority, the source of guidance and the position of every believer vis-&-vis the Covenant. 

 It has been well called the 'Charter of the New 

World Order of Baha'u'llah'.

 The Tablets of the Divine Plan, a series of fourteen letters written by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the believers of the United States and Canada, some addressed to the entire company of believers in the North American continent and others to those in named geographical areas of that continent, constitute the charter for teaching the Faith throughout the world. 'Abdu'l-Baha names the places, the people to whom teachers must go, the conditions under which they must travel and settle and He reveals several  prayers for those who undertake this all-important  task. 

 All the international plans of the Faith launched so far have set specitic goals aimed at 

'Shoghi Effendi, The Spiritual
Potencies of That Consecrated 
Spot.                      
2 Shoghi Effendi, The      
Dispensation of Baha'u'llah.

 implementing these three charters and it is incontrovertibly apparent that never in any preceding Dispensation has the command to spread the Word of God been given, in the sacred text, such explicit guidance and detailed objectives. 

 As the Faith of Baha'u'llah increases in size and influence other aims and objectives become apparent and ~ossibIe of pursuit. The relationship with agencies, institutions and authorities of the nonBahA'i world becomes an important consideration once the community  emerges from obscurity, and has led to public relations programmes and the development of closer association with the United Nations. 

The Baha'i International    

 Community is accredited as a nongovernmental agency with consultative status to the United 

Nations Economic and Social

 Council (ECOSOC) and in various ways to other agencies of the United Nations. 

 The fostering of this relationship has been the goal of all international plans so far, and is visualized as a continuing process. 

 There are other objectives related to the special characteristics of Baha'i life which become more and more important as the Faith grows and engages greater and greater public attention.  They affect Baha'i individuals, communities  and institutions alike. These objectives fall into two groups — those concerned specifically with standards of conduct and those which relate to special Baha'i practices. 

 The standards of conduct enjoined by the Prophet are invariably different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to the generally accepted ones of His day. High standards of conduct are, throughout Baha'i scripture, constantly upheld and urged upon the believers,  but the Guardian of the Faith in an essay written in 1938 addressed to the believers in the United States and Canada laid great stress upon the 'spiritual prerequisites. 

 which constitute  the bedrock on which all teaching plans... must ultimately rest. .'~ He writes of .... a high sense of moral rectitude in their social and administrative activities, absolute chastity in their individual lives, and complete freedom from prejudice in their dealings with peoples of a different race, class, creed or colour.'4  In his expansion of this theme he declared that 'This rectitude of conduct, with

of Divine Justice.

<p4>

  its implications of justice, equity, truthfulness, honesty, fairmindedness, reliability, and trustworthiness, must distinguish every phase of the life of the Baha'i community." 'A chaste and holy life must be made the controlling principle in the behaviour and conduct of all Baha'is, both in their social relationships with the members of their own community, and in their contacts with the world at large.'2 'It requires total abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from opium, and from similar habit-forming drugs. It condemns the prostitution of art and of literature, the practices of nudism and of corn-panionate marriage, infidelity in marital relationships, and all manner of promiscuity, of easy familiarity, and of sexual vices.'3 'As to racial prejudice, the corrosion of which, for well nigh a century, has bitten into the fibre, and attacked the whole social structure of American society, it should be regarded as constituting the most vital and challenging issue confronting the Baha'i community [of that country] 

 at the present stage of its evolu-'4 tion. 

 The regeneration of men — the first objective of religion mentioned in this essay — is therefore  ~een as the prime objective of the 

Baha'i Faith. Membership 

 in the Faith is drawn from that society which permits and indulges itself in all those corrupt, immoral and prejudiced activities which Baha'is are required to renounce, and since the Faith is steadily but persistently growing in numbers there is reason to hope that slowly but surely a regeneration will take place. 

       Further, these Baha'i     

 standards of conduct are not for individuals alone. 

 They must be the hallmark of Baha'i institutions and communities.  ~Such a rectitude of conduct,' wrote the Guardian, 'must manifest itself, with ever-increasing  potency, in every verdict which the elected representatives of the Baha'i community, in whatever capacity they may find themselves, may be called upon to pronounce. It must be constantly reflected in the business dealings of all its members, in their domestic lives, in all manner of employment, and in any service they may, in the future, render their government or people.'5 'It must be made the hallmark of that numerically small, yet 

'Shoghi Effendi, The Advent

 ibid. intensely dynamic and highly responsible body of the elected national representatives of every Baha'i community, which constitutes the sustaining  pillar, and the sole instrument for the election in every community, of that Universal House whose very name and title, as ordained by Baha'u'llah, symbolizes that rectitude of conduct which is its highest mission to safeguard and enforce.'6 The attitudes deriving from such standards, and from all' the varied teachings of Baha'u'llah, must pervade all Baha'i commu~1ities and imbue them with distinctive characteristics which can be recognized, amid the welter of opposing or mutually uninterested groups and factions into which modern society is disintegrating,  as easily as the features of an individual  in a crowd. 

 Those special Baha'i practices which will inevitably characterize the Baha'i community, are the regular observances of its Holy Days and Festivals, the abstention from work on nine such days during the year, the observances by all members of the community of the annual fast, of the laws governing marriage and divorce, of daily prayer, of the invariable practice  of consultation in all affairs of life, and particularly by the regular observance of the Nineteen Day Feast. 

 The habitual practice of such laws and ordinances is an objective pursued by all Baha'is and Baha'i families. 

 It is seen that the aims and purposes of the Baha'i Faith may be stated as the raising up of a worldwide community recruited from every race, nation, colour, religious and social background  known on the planet, inspired, united and regenerated by the spiritual teachings and love of Baha'u'llah, dedicated to the building of that New World Order which 'may well be regarded as the brightest emanation'7 of His mind and is none other than the long hoped for, Christ-promised Kingdom of God on earth. To prepare men for the gifts of that Kingdom  — peace, brotherhood, spirituality — and to raise its very fabric in the world, are the immediate and longtime objectives of the Baha'i Faith. 

 The energies of the Baha'is therefore, in pursuance of these aims, flow in three major channels: individual spiritual development, 6 ibid.

INTRODUCTION                 5

  conveying the message of Baha'u'llah to others, and developing the pattern of world society embodied in the Baha'i administrative order. All these activities derive from the sacred text and it is the unique feature of the Baha'i revelation that whereas the first two are common to all revealed religions it is only Baha'u'llah Who creates the jnstitutions and reveals the Jaws, delineates the social order and establishes the principles of the civilization to which His revelation will give rise. Neither Moses nor Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, Zoroaster or Krishna did this, although They all foretold that it would be done by Him Who would take the government upon His shoulders  and establish the Kingdom in peace and righteousness. 

 None of the traditional motives operates to create the Baha'i community, neither former associations, political or economic identity of interest, racial or patriotic grouping. 

 Only the recognition and love of Baha'u'llah brings into close relatedness and cooperative action peo-pie  from every human background, of all types of character and personality, divergent and diversified interest. Through their brotherhood  in Baha'u'llah the old crystallized forms of human divisiveness to which they formerly belonged, whether of class, race, religion, occupation, temperament or degree of civilization  lose their rigidity and eventually disintegrate.  The growing Baha'i community on the other hand is essentially based on love, is a brotherhood, a family, each member delighting  in the diversity of its membership, welcoming the former pariah or outcast as a new flower in the garden, each as proud of his humanity as was ever the former chauvinist of his country. 

 Within such a community the sun of Baha'u'llah's revelation can evoke new morals, new attitudes, new conventions, new hopes and visions,  all enshrined within the text of the revelation itself and which provide the spiritual atmosphere and distinctive culture of the new day. Such a community, as it grows, becomes more and more a true social order, providing a soil to human life, a climate for its best development, an arena for the practice of its highest aspirations, and a beacon light to attract and guide the disillusioned, spiritually impoverished, frenetic and frustrated peoples of the earth. 

 The energies of this new culture, guided and conserved to the service of human welfare by the agencies of Baha'u'llah's World Order will result in the proliferation of new arts and sciences, new social and economic relationships, new educational methods and a general accession  of wellbeing and felicity. The vision of the Baha'i Faith, though glorious, is a practical one, and the number of its dedicated promoters  grows with increasing speed. 

 It is summarized  in the following words by the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith in his essay The 

Unfoldment of World Civilization:

 'The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha'u'llah, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently  united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded.  This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. 

 A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A wor!d 

 tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system. 

 A mechanism of world intercommunication will be devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning  with marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity. 

 A world metropolis will act as the nerve centre of a world civilization, the focus toward& which the unifying forces of life will converge and from which its energizing influences will radiate. A world language will either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary  to their mother tongue. A world script, a world literature, a uniform and universal system  of currency, of weights and measures,.will simplify and facilitate intercourse and under

  standing among the nations and races of mankind. 

 In such a world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces in human life, will be reconciled, will cooperate, and will harmoniously develop. The press will, under such a system, while giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and convictions  of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private  or public, and will be liberated from the influence of contending governments and peo-pies.  The economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will be coordinated and developed, and the distribution of its products will be equitably regulated. 

 'National rivalries, hatred, and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity, understanding and cooperation. 

 The causes of religious strife will be permanently removed, economic barriers and restrictions will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear. 

 The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the range of human inventions and technical development, to the increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising of the standard  of physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of human Life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race. 

 'A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation — such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving.'

EXCERPTS FROM
             THE BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS

                   1. BAHA'U'LLAH

  Excerpts from Fire and Light1 ALL praise be to God Who, from every drop of blood shed by His chosen ones, hath brought forth a vast creation whose number none but Himself can reckon. 

 He hath raised them to be the embodiments of His love and the manifestations of His tender affection. 

 It is they who are the hands of His Cause amongst men. It is they who have rendered aid unto God in every age and have arisen to promote that which He bath purposed in such wise that the majesty of the kings and their dreadful might have failed to affright them, nor have they been hindered from following the path of truth by the clash of arms and the furious clamour of battalions. 

 They have raised their triumphal cry amidst all that dwell in the heavens and on the earth, summoning everyone unto the Lord of all mankind, He Who is the Ruler of this world and of the next, the God of the throne on high and of the earth below. 
                           
He is God — Blessed and Exalted

 is He ALL praise unto the Almighty the Sanctified  — glorified be His power — Who hath ordained that the tyranny of the unjust and the violence of the oppressors should become the means whereby the true lovers draw nigh unto the glorious habitation of the Best All but No. XI are excerpts translated by Mr. Habib Taherzadeh, with the assistance of a Committee at the Baha World Centre, from Fire and Light [Ndr va 

Nan                        
(Hofheim-Langenhain: Baha'i

 Verlag, 1982), a compilation from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha and 

Shoghi Effendi.            

 Beloved and the sincere among His servants attain the Paradise of communion with Him Who is the Desire of all men, and that sufferings and tribulations should serve as the instrument whereby His Word of command is spread abroad and the standards of His praise are unfurled in all regions. 

 How great is His transcendent power, how immensely exalted His all-embracing Will, inasmuch as He produceth light from fire and joy from sorrow. 

 They that are sunk in heedlessness fondly imagine that massacre and crucifixion cause the fire of the Word of God to be extinguished, and regard martyrdom as a devastating injury. They are utterly oblivious of the truth that through such afflictions the Cause of God is exalted, its fame is blazoned far and wide, and the martyrs themselves are enabled to attain the boundless retreats of nearness unto God. Immeasurably exalted is the Lord of Wisdom who doeth that which He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.

  In the Name of the Loving 

Friend                     

  0  MOTHER! Grieve not over the loss of thy son; rather pride thyself therein. 

 Indeed this is an occasion for gladness and rejoicing, not for despondency and sorrow. 

 I swear by the DayStar of the morn of Truth that thy son hath attained a station such as no pen can depict, nor words adequately describe. His habitation is the realm on high, his associates and companions are sanctified and detached souls, and his sustenance the 9

10                 THE BAHA'! WORLD

  imperishable and hidden blessings of the Lord. 

 In truth were that lofty and glorious station to be revealed to an extent smaller than a needle's eye before the eyes of them that dwell on earth, they would, one and all, be so filled with joy and ecstasy as to be consumed thereby. Therefore think not that he hath perished. 

 Indeed he will endure in the heavenly kingdom as long as God Himself endureth. 

 And this calleth for gratitude, not grieving. 

 When he findeth that thou art happy he becometh more cheerful, but when he perceiveth that thou art disconsolate, this provoketh anguish in his heart. 

 Busy thyself in the remembrance of God and unloose thy tongue in celebrating His praise with utmost joy and radiance. God, the Exalted, the True is with thee. He is kinder than a father and more compassionate than a son. 

 Call thou to mind the episode of the land of Taf (Karbil6), when a mother sent forth her son who laid down his life in the path of the Beloved. 

 This Day is the king of days. It behoveth thee to show forth such deeds as will distinguish thee from the women of a bygone age. 

 Such beseemeth the servants and maidservants  of God. Be thou resigned to His good-pleasure and seek communion with Him. 

 At this moment the entire company of the Concourse on high are engaged in extolling the virtues of thy son and in acclaiming his attributes. If thou couldst hear, thou wouldst, in thy longing, wing thy flight unto God, the Incomparable, the All-Informed. The day is not far distant when all the dwellers of the earth will magnify his praise and seek blessings from his dust. Verily incalculable is the bounty of thy Lord. Seize thy chance and be of them that endure with patience. 

  NOTHING hath ever happened nor will happen without a cause or effect. Reflect a while and consider how vast the number of the people that have perished, how numerous the cities and towns that have been reduced to dust and now appear as a level plain. 

 Such is their plight now and only God knoweth the future and that which will come to pass. 

 Think not that in this turmoil the friends of God have perished by the sword of the oppressors. 

 I swear by the DayStar of the Kingdom of truth that any of the Loved ones of God that hath quaffed the cup of martyrdom during that episode hath ascended unto the realms above and doth abide securely beneath the canopy of the tender mercy of God. Indeed if those sublime stations were unveiled before the gaze of men, even to the extent of a needle's eye, everyone would raise his voice and exclaim: 'Would that I had been with him!' And if any of the friends halt suffered a material loss, such a loss is and will always be a perfect gain. The people of Baha enjoy utmost benefits, at all times. 

 If at some time or other, according to the dictates of God's inscrutable wisdom, one should incur a certain loss, let not this cause distress. 

 Surely God will glorify it into a gift of inestimable gain. Verily, He is the Lord of Truth, the Powerful, the Knowing, the Wise. 

  'You should exhort all the friends to patience, to acquiescence, and to tranquillity, saying: 0 ye loved ones of God in that land! Ye are glorified in all the worlds of God because of your relationship to Him Who is the Eternal Truth, but in your lives on this earthly plane, which pass away as a fleeting moment, ye are inflicted with abasement. 

 For the sake of the One True God, ye have been reviled and persecuted, ye have been imprisoned,  and surrendered your lives in His path. Ye should not, however, by reason of the tyrannical acts of some heedless souls, transgress  the limits of God's commandments by contending with anyone. 

 Whatever hath befallen you, hath been for the sake of God. This is the truth, and in this there is no doubt. You should, therefore, leave all your affairs in His Hands, place your trust in Him, and rely upon Him. He will assuredly not forsake you. In this, likewise, there is no doubt. No father will surrender his Sons to devouring beasts; no shepherd will leave his flock to ravening wolves. He will most certainly do his utmost to protect his own. 

 If, however, for a few days, in compliance with God's all-encompassing wisdom, outward  affairs should run their course contrary to one's cherished desire, this is of no consequence  and should not matter. Our intent is that all the friends should fix their gaze on the


<p11>
THE BAHA'I REVELATION         11

  Supreme Horizon, and cling to that which hath been revealed in the Tablets. 

 They should strictly avoid sedition, and refrain from treading the path of dissension and strife. They should champion their One True God, exalted be He, through the hosts of forbearance,  of submission, of an upright character, of goodly deeds, and of the choicest and most refined words. 

  THEY that yearn for the abode of the Beloved, they that circle round the sanctuary of the Desired One, are not apprehensive of trials and adversities, nor do they flee away from that which is ordained by God. They receive their portion from the ocean of resignation and drink their fill from the soft-flowing stream of His mercy. They would not surrender the good-pleasure of the Friend in exchange for the kingdom of both worlds, nor would they barter that which the Well-Beloved  hath decreed in return for dominion over the realms of the infinite. They would eagerly drink the venom of wbe as if it were the water of life and would drain deadly poison to its bitter dregs just as a sweet and life-giving draught. In the arid wastes of desolation they are stirred with enthusiasm through the remembrance of the Friend, and in the dreary wilds of adversity they are eager and impatient to offer themselves as a sacri-flee.  Unhesitatingly have they renounced their lives and directed their steps towards the abode of the Best Beloved. They have closed their eyes to the world and fixed their gaze upon the beauteous countenance of the Friend, cherishing no desire but the presence of the loved One and seeking no attainment save reunion with Him. They fly with the feathers of trust in God, and soar with the wings of adherence unto His Will. In their estimation a bloodshedding blade is more desirable than finest silk and a piercing dart more acceptable than mother's milk. 

  'High-spirited souls by the myriad are deemed necessary in this path, To lay down a hundred lives with every fleeting breath.' 

  It behoveth us to kiss the hand of the wouldbe assassin and to set out, dancing, on our way to the habitation of the 

Friend. How                

 indescribably pleasant is that hour, how immeasurably sweet that moment when the inmost spirit is intent upon sacrificing itself, when the tabernacle of fidelity is hastening to attain the heights of self-surrender! 

 With necks laid bare, we yearn for the stroke of the ruthless sword wielded by the hand of the Beloved. 

 With breasts aglow with light, we eagerly await the dart of His decree. 

 Contemptuous  of name, we have detached ourselves from all else but Him, we shall not run away, we shall not endeavour to repel the stranger, we pray for calamity, that thereby we may soar 'into the sublime heights of the spirit, seek shelter beneath the shade of the tree of reunion, attain the highest stations of love, and drink our fill from the wondrous wine of everlasting communion with Him. Surely we will not forfeit this imperishable dominion, nor will we forgo this incomparable blessing. 

 If hidden beneath the dust, we shall rear our heads from the bosom of the tender mercy of the Lord of mankind. No trial can suppress these companions, no mortal feet can traverse this journey, nor can any veil obscure this countenance. 

 Yea, it is clear and evident that in view of the multitudes of internal and external opponents  who have raised the standards of opposition, who have girded the loins of endeavour to eliminate these poor creatures, it standeth to reason that one should turn away from them and flee from this land, nay, from the face of the earth. However, through the lovingkindness of God and by the aid of His invisible confirmations, we are as radiant as the sun and as shining as the moon. We are established upon the throne of tranquillity and seated upon the couch of fortitude. Of what importance is the shipwreck to the fish of the spirit? What doth a soul celestial care if the physical frame is destroyed? Indeed this body is for it a prison; and the ship but a place of confinement to the fish. 

 What else but a nightingale can understand a Nightingale's melody and who else but the intimate friend can recognize the familiar voice of the 

Friend?                    
                           
            VII                        

  THE majesty and glory of the Cause are as great as its trials and afflictions are intense. However, trials and afflictions are scarce noticed in this day, inasmuch as the heaven of


<p12>
12                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  divine bounty is uplifted and the ocean of His loving kindness is manifest. 

 If on the one hand cups of bitter woe and suffering are seen, on the other 

He Who is the AbhA Beauty 

 is proferring, with His Own hand that hath turned white, the chalice of everlasting life. Though the croaking of the Raven is loud, the river of His choice wine is streaming forth. 

 In one of the Tablets the following utterances were sent down by the Revealer of Verses — glorified and exalted be His Words: Say, 0 ye chosen of the one true God! Let not the censure of the froward, nor the denunciations uttered by them that have repudiated His Cause, grieve you; inasmuch as such acts of opposition have, from time immemorial, served as clear proofs of the truth of Him Who is the True One —  magnified be His glory. Therefore should ye hear an unseemly word from an ignorant, foolish or negligent soul, be sure that it can never do harm, for the day is not far distant when such persons and whatsoever pertain-eth  unto them will have passed away, whereas ye yourselves have been honoured in this day to drink your fill from the living waters of the holy utterances revealed by the All-Merciful and to hearken unto the words: 'Ye are of My company.' 

 Thereupon one of the favoured angels that are nigh unto God and circle round His throne uttered this supplication: '0 my Lord and my Master! 0 my Desired One and my Best Beloved! 0 Thou who art the Beloved of all that are in the heavens and on the earth! I beseech Thee to grant, from the ocean of Thy bounty and the daystar of Thy heavenly grace, that I may be cursed, reviled and denounced a myriad times for the sake of Thy love, that these ears of mine may but once be blessed by hearing Thy sweet words: "Verily thou art of the people of Most of the people of the earth have turned away from the one true God and failed to take their portion from the ocean of divine knowledge. 

 They have ascribed and will continue to ascribe unto Him that which hath caused the inmates of the all-highest Paradise as well as the Prophets and Messengers of God to weep sore and wail. 

 This is not the first divine Revelation that hath been manifested in the world. They that are the chosen ones of God should at all times and under all conditions dedicate themselves assiduously to the service of His Cause. Rumi' — upon him be the mercy of God — saith: 'the moon sheddeth light while the dog howleth.' 

 It behoveth everyone to have the utmost regard for the reformation of the world and for that which beseemeth man's sublime station. However, should the continued  existence of anyone be detrimental to the interests of the Cause of God, the Almighty will undoubtedly lay hold on him as He hath in the past. No one hath fathomed nor can fathom His transcendent wisdom. 
                          
           VIII                      

  A. PRAISE, exalted above every conception  that pen and ink can portray, beseemeth the sublime, the ever-blessed court of the Well-Beloved Who hath initiated the people of Baha into the school of adversity and directed their steps towards the realm of immortality. 

 Glorified, immensely glorified is the omnipotent Lord Who hath made blood as a means to cause the trees of the exalted Paradise to grow and burst forth, and Who hath ordained that trials and afflictions, though bitter and agonizing, should prove sweeter than sugar to the taste of His loved ones. So strong are the bonds of love for this Well-Beloved that adversities and tribulations have been and will ever be powerless to deflect His ardent lovers from treading 

His Path.                 

 I swear by Him Who is Our Beloved and your Beloved, that if one's life be not offered up in His path, it would not be worth even as much as a mustard seed, and if one's inmost being were not Laid down at His feet, it would appear more abject and insignificant than a pebble. However, none but the divine Assayers are able to recognize this gem. In truth, when bereft of vision, what advantage would one gain by entering into the all-highest Paradise? 

 If destitute of hearing, what can one perceive by drawing close unto the celestial Tree of 

Blessedness? The Assayers 

 of these priceless gems are such souls unto whom the following tribute is paid: 'They that speak not till He hath spoken and act according to 

His commandment.'2 Likewise

 He saith: 'They

TEE BAHA'I REVELATION          13

  whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of the 

Almighty.'1               

 Is it fondly imagined that death shall not overtake everyone? Nay, by God! 

 'Every soul shall taste of death.'2 Such being the case, it would certainly be far better and more fitting if this mortal life were offered up in the path of the Beloved, and sacrificed for the sake of Him Who is the ultimate Desire of all men. 

 Nay, I beg forgiveness of God for this assertion, inasmuch as this sacrifice would be a myriad times more preferable and fitting. Even for this assertion, I once again implore pardon of God. 

 I earnestly hope and pray that the one true God — magnified be His glory — may graciously brighten the eyes of all men with the collyrium of His knowledge, that they may be enabled to discern with both their inner and outer eyes that which the victims of evil passions and corrupt desires are debarred from seeing and recognizing. 

 Salutation and praise rest upon them that have not been kept back by any transitory thing whatever, nor have been alarmed by the violent commotions provoked by the people of the earth — such people as are immersed in the pursuit of earthly vanities and have been deluded by the gay livery of the world, in such wise that they have cast the Cause of God behind their backs. The day is fast approaching  when He will have rolled up their domain and spread out a new one in its stead. 

 Verily, He is the One, the Peerless, the Powerful, the Invincible, the Almighty. 

  IF occasionally, in accordance with the exigencies  of God's consummate wisdom, an untoward  incident should befall the friends, it would undoubtedly serve as a means whereby divine gifts and heaven-sent bounties will be vouchsafed unto them. Ponder thou upon the tragic episode that hath transpired in the land of YA (Yazd). 

 I swear by My life, every single event associated therewith hath led to the exaltation of the Word of God and the advancement of His Cause. Indeed whatsoever doth happen during the days of the Manifestation  of God, though to outward seeming it is but grievous abasement, there lieth concealed ibid. 24:37 2 ibid. 3:184 within it incalculable glory and honour; and though it appeareth as dire torment, in reality a myriad blessings are enshrined therein. 

 If those that have erred grievously were aware of the hidden mysteries of martyrdom, they would in no wise commit such deeds. However, God hath caused them to be tongue-tied and bereft of sight, with their minds and power of perception reduced to naught, in such wise that they deem a priceless benefit a grievous loss. With their own hands they help the Cause of God, though they themselves are wholly unconscious of it. Verily God would at one time render His Cause victorious through the aid of His enemies and at another by virtue of the assistance of His chosen ones. Concerning those pure and blessed souls, Our Pen of Glory hath revealed that which excelleth the whole world, its treasures and whatsoever existeth therein. Ere long shall the heedless and the doers of wickedness be repaid for that which their hands have wrought. 

  THE people of the world have grievously erred, for they fondly imagine that they can exterminate the Cause of God, that they would be able to extinguish His effulgent light, and to put out His heavenly lamps. Vain indeed are their imaginings. I swear by the righteousness of God that the more they endeavour to quench His Light, the brighter will it shine, and the more they strive to smother its flame, the fiercer will it burn. God's invincible Will far transcendeth their devices, and His Purpose is supreme above all human desires, inasmuch as all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth have been called into being through a single holy breeze — the Word of His command — wafted from His presence, and all shall be brought to naught through but one letter of His. From time immemorial He hath been established upon the seat of His sovereignty and through eternity will He continue to occupy the inaccessible  heights of His glory. Every created thing is impotent before the evidences of His invincible might, and all beings fade into utter nothingness when confronted with the revelation of His awesome majesty. 

 The eyes of His loved ones have always wept sore, while His enemies have rejoiced


<p14>
THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and made merry by reason of their heedlessness. 

 However, that weeping was followed by a myriad blessings and this jubilation by grievous retribution. 

 Ere long the fruits of these two shall appear from the tree of His irrevocable Decree. Therefore how justifiably proud must be the eye which is worthy of shedding tears and how great the felicity of the neck that is fit to be ensnared in the noose of the Friend. 

  o   GOD, my God! Thou seest Thy loved ones turning their hearts to Thee, and holding fast unto the cord of Thy ordinances and laws. 

 I beseech Thee by the waves of the sea of Thine utterance, and by Him through whom Thou didst adorn the heavens of Thy might, to graciously protect them, by the aid of Thy hosts. 

        0     God! Thou beholdest Thy

 lovers in fran in the clutches of hate and enmity. I beg of Thee, by Thy mercy which hath preceded the contingent world, to raise up from the earth those who will be moved to aid and protect them, and to preserve their xights and the restitution due to them by those who broke Thy Covenant and Testament, and perpetrated such acts as made the inmates of the cities of Thy justice and equity to lament. 

 Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the 

All-Wise.

 Excerpts from Selections from the Writings of the BTh1 THE substance wherewith God hath created  Me is not the clay out of which others have been formed. 

 He hath conferred upon Me that which the worldly-wise can never comprehend, nor the faithful discover I am one of the sustaining pillars of the Primal Word of God. Whosoever hath recognized Me, bath known all that is true and right, and hat attained all that is good and seemly; and whosoever hath failed to recognize Me, hath turned away from all that is true and right and hath succumbed to everything evil and unseemly. 

 I swear by the righteousness of Thy Lord, the Lord of all created things, the Lord of all the worlds! 

 Were a man to rear in this world as many edifices as possible and worship God through every virtuous deed which God's knowledge embraceth, and attain the presence of the Lord, and were he, even to a measure less than that which is accountable before God, to bear in his heart a trace of malice towards Me, all his deeds would be reduced to naught and he would be deprived of the glances of God's favour, become the object of His wrath and assuredly perish. 

 For God hath ordained that all the good things which lie in the treasury of His knowledge shall be attained through obedience unto Me, and every fire recorded in His Book, through disobedience unto Me. Methinks in this day and from this station I behold all those who cherish My love and follow My behest abiding within the mansions of Paradise, and the entire company of Mine adversaries consigned to the lowest depths of hellfire I SWEAR by the Most Great

Were he who hath been willing to treat Me in such a manner to know Who it is Whom he hath so treated, he, verily, would never in his life be happy. Nay — I, verily, acquaint thee with the truth of the matter — it is as if he hath imprisoned all the Prophets, and all the men of truth and all the chosen ones When this decree was made known unto Me, I wrote to him who administereth the affairs of the kingdom, saying: 'Put Me to death, I adjure thee by God, and send My head wherever thou pleasest. For surely an innocent person such as I, cannot reconcile himself to being consigned to a place reserved for criminals and let his life continue.' 
My plea remained unanswered.

Evidently His Excellency  

 the H6ji, is not fully aware of the truth of our Cause. It would be far more heinous a deed to sadden the hearts of the faithful, whether men or women, than to lay waste the sacred House of God. 

    Verily, the One True God   

 beareth Me witness that in this Day I am the true mystic Fane of God, and the Essence of all good. 

 He who doeth good unto Me, it is as if he doeth good unto God, His angels and the entire company of His loved ones. He~ who doeth evil unto Me, it is as if he doeth evil unto God and His chosen ones. Nay, too exalted is the station of God and of His loved ones for any person's good or evil deed to reach their holy threshold. Whatever reacheth Me is ordained to reach Me; and that which hath come unto Me, to him who giveth will it revert. 

 By the One in Whose hand is My soul, he hath cast no one but himself into prison. 

 For assuredly whatsoever God hath decreed for Me shall come to pass and naught else save that which God hath.ordained for us shall ever touch us. Woe betide him from whose hands floweth evil, and blessed the man from whose hands floweth good. 

 Unto no one do I take My plaint save to God; for He is the best of judges.

  0 PEOPLES of the earth! 

 Verily the resplendent Light of God hath appeared in your midst, invested with this unerring Book, that ye may be guided aright to the ways of peace and, by the leave of God, step out of the darkness into the light and onto this far-extended  Path of Truth. 
Chapter LXII, Qayydmu'l-Asmd.

  CONSIDER the manifold favours vouchsafed  by the Promised One, and the effusions of His bounty which have pervaded the concourse of the followers of IslAm to enable them to attain unto salvation. Indeed observe how He Who representeth the origin of creation, He Who is the Exponent of the verse, 'I, in very truth, am God', identified Himself as the Gate [B~b] for the advent of the promised Q6'im, a descendant of Muhammad, and in His first Book enjoined the observance of the laws of the Qur'an, so that the people might not be seized with perturbation by reason of a new Book and a new Revelation and might regard His Faith as similar to their own, perchance they would not turn away from the Truth and ignore the thing for which they had been called into being. 

  THOU seest, 0 my Lord, my dwelling-place in the heart of this mountain and Thou dost witness my forbearance. Verily I have desired naught else but Thy love and the love of those who love Thee. How can I extol the effulgent beauty of Thy Lordship, conscious as I am of my nothingness before the habitation of Thy glory? Yet the sorrow of solitude and loneliness  prompteth me to invoke Thee through this prayer, perchance Thy trusted servants may become aware of my lamentations, may supplicate unto Thee on my behalf, and Thou wouldst graciously answer their prayers as a token of Thy grace and Thy favour. 

 I bear witness  that there is no God but Thee, inasmuch as Thou art invested with sovereignty, grandeur, glory and power which no one among Thy servants can visualize or comprehend. Indeed Thou shalt, by virtue of that which is inherent in Thine Essence, ever remain inscrutable unto all except Thyself. 

  Is there any Remover of difficulties save 

God? Say: Praised be God!  

 He is God! All are His servants and all abide by His bidding!

 His are the most excellent titles; it is He Who causeth His Word to be fulfilled as He pleaseth and it is He Who leadeth those who have received illumination and seek the way of righteousness. 

 Fear thou God, thy Lord, and ffiake mention of His Name in the daytime and at eventide. Follow not the promptings of the faithless, lest thou be reckoned among the exponents of idle fancies. 

 Faithfully obey the Primal Point Who is the Lord Himself, and be of the righteous. Let nothing cause thee to be sore shaken, neither let the things which have been destined to take place in this Cause disturb thee. Strive earnestly for the sake of God and walk in the path of righteousness. 

 Shouldst thou encounter the unbelievers, place thy whole trust in God, thy Lord, saying, Sufficient is God unto me in the kingdoms of both this world and the next. 

 The Day is approaching when God shall bring the faithful together. In truth no God is there other than Him. 

 May the peace of God be with those who have been guided aright through the power of divine guidance.

Send down upon them that which will bring comfort to their minds, will rejoice their inner beings, will impart assurance to their hearts and tranquillity to their bodies and will enable their souls to ascend to the presence of God, the Most Exalted, and to attain the supreme

  and such retreats of glory as Thou hast destined for men of true knowledge and virtue. Verily Thou knowest all things, while we are but Thy servants, Thy thralls, Thy bondsmen and Thy poor ones. No Lord but Thee do we invoke, 0 God our Lord, nor do we implore blessings or grace from anyone but Thee, 0 Thou Who art the God of mercy unto this world and the next. We are but the embodiments of poverty, of nothingness, of helplessness and of perdition, while Thy whole Being betokeneth wealth, independence, glory, majesty and boundless grace. 

 Turn our recompense, 0 Lord, into that which well beseemeth Thee of the good of this world and of the next, and of the manifold bounties which extend from on high down to the earth below. 

 Verily Thou art our Lord and the Lord of all things. 

 Into Thy hands do we surrender ourselves, yearning for the things that pertain unto 

Thee.                     

  GLORY be unto Thee, 0 Lord! Although Thou mayest cause a person to be destitute of all earthly possessions, and from the begin-fling  of his life until his ascension unto Thee he may be reduced to poverty through the operation of Thy decree, yet wert Thou to have brought him forth from the Tree of Thy love, such a bounty would indeed be far better for him than all the things Thou hast created in heaven and earth and whatsoever lieth between them; inasmuch as he will inherit the heavenly home, through the revelation of Thy favours, and will partake of the goodly gifts Thou hast provided therein; for the things which are with Thee are inexhaustible. 

 This indeed is Thy blessing which according to the good-pleasure of Thy Will Thou dost bestow on those who tread the path of Thy love. 

 How numerous the souls who in former times were put to death for Thy sake, and in whose names all men now pride themselves; and how vast the number of those whom Thou didst enable to acquire earthly fortunes, and who amassed them while they were deprived of Thy Truth, and who in this day have passed into oblivion. 

 Theirs is a grievous chastisement  and a dire punishment. 

 0  Lord! Provide for the speedy growth of the Tree of Thy divine Unity; water it then, 0 Lord, with the flowing waters of Thy good-pleasure, and cause it, before the revelations of Thy divine assurance, to yield such fruits as Thou desirest for Thy glorification and exaltation,  Thy praise and thanksgiving, and to magnify Thy Name, to laud the oneness of Thine Essence and to offer adoration unto Thee, inasmuch as all this lieth within Thy grasp and in that of none other. 

 Great is the blessedness of those whose blood Thou hast chosen wherewith to water the Tree of Thine affirmation, and thus to exalt Thy holy and immutable Word. 

 Ordain for me, 0 my Lord, and for those who believe in Thee that which is deemed best for us in Thine estimation, as set forth in the Mother Book, for within the grasp of Thy hand Thou boldest the determined measures of all things TRUE death is realized when a person clieth to himself at the time of His Revelation in such wise that he seeketh naught except Him. 

  •    God sent forth His Prophet Muhammad, on that day the termination of the prophetic cycle was foreordained in the knowledge of God. 

 Yea, that promise hath indeed come true and the decree of God hath been accomplished as He bath ordained. Assuredly we are today living in the Days of God. These are the glorious days on the like of which the sun hath never risen in the past. These are the days which the people in bygone times eagerly expected. What hath then befallen  you that ye are fast asleep? These are the days wherein God hath caused the DayStar of Truth to shine resplendent. 

 What hath then caused you to keep your silence? 

 These are the appointed days which ye have been yearningly awaiting in the past — the days of the advent of divine justice. Render ye thanks unto God, 0 ye concourse of believers. 

 Let not the deeds of those who reject the Truth shut you out as by a veil. 

 Such people have warrant over your bodies only, and God hath not reposed in them power over your spirits, your souls and your hearts. 
Fear ye

 God that haply it may be well with you. All things have been created for your sakes, and for the sake of naught else hath your creation been ordained. 

 Fear ye God and take heed lest forms and apparels debar you from recognizing Him. Render ye thanksgiving unto God that perchance He may deal mercifully  with you. 

 This mortal life is sure to perish; its pleasures are bound to fade away and ere long ye shall return unto God, distressed with pangs of remorse, for presently ye shall be roused from your slumber, and ye shall soon find yourselves in the presence of God and will be asked of your doings These verses, clear and conclusive, are a token of the mercy of thy Lord and a source of guidance for all mankind. They are a light unto those who believe in them and a fire of afflictive torment for those who turn away and reject them.

  LAUDED be Thy Name, 0 Lord our God! Thou art in truth the Knower of things unseen. Ordain for us such good as Thine all-embracing  knowledge can measure. Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the Best Beloved. 

 All praise be unto Thee, 0 Lord! We shall seek Thy grace on the appointed Day and shall put our whole reliance in Thee, Who art our Lord. Glorified art Thou, 0 God! Grant us that which is good and seemly that we may be able to dispense with everything but Thee. Verily Thou art the Lord of all worlds. 

 0 God! Recompense those who endure patiently in Thy days and, strengthen their hearts to walk undeviatingly in the path of Truth. 

 Grant then, 0 Lord, such goodly gifts as would enable them to gain admittance into Thy blissful Paradise. 

Exalted art Thou, 0 Lord   

 God. Let Thy heavenly blessings descend upon homes whose inmates have believed in Thee. Verily, unsurpassed art Thou in sending down divine blessings. Send forth, 0 God, such hosts as would render Thy faithful servants victorious. Thou dost fashion the created things through the power of Thy decree as Thou pleasest. 

 Thou art in truth the Sovereign, the Creator, the All-Wise. 

 Say: God is indeed the Maker of all things. He giveth sustenance in plenty to whomsoever He willeth. He is the Creator, the Source of alP beings, the Fashioner, the Almighty, the Maker, the All-Wise. He is the Bearer of the most excellent titles throughout the heavens and the earth and whatever lieth between them. 

 All do His bidding, and all the dwellers of earth and heaven celebrate His praise, and unto Him shall all return. 
                           
           XIII                       

  How numerous the souls raised to life who were exposed to dire humiliation in Thy Path for exalting Thy Word and for glorifying 

Thy divine Unity! How      

 profuse the blood that bath been shed for the sake of Thy Faith to vindicate  the authenticity of Thy divine Mission and to celebrate Thy praise! 

 How vast the possessions that were wrongfully seized in the Path of Thy love in order to affirm the loftiness of Thy sanctity and to extol Thy glorious Name! 

 How many the feet that have trodden upon the dust in order to magnify Thy holy Word and to extol Thy glory! How innumerable the voices that were raised in lamentation, the hearts that were struck with terror, the grievous woes that none other than Thee can reckon, and the adversities and afflictions that remain inscrutable to anyone except Thyself; all this to establish, 0 my God, the loftiness of Thy sanctity and to demonstrate the transcendent  character of Thy glory. 

 These decrees were ordained by Thee so that all created things might bear witness that they have been brought into being for the sake of naught else but Thee. 

 Thou hast withheld from them the things that bring tranquillity to their hearts, that they might know of a certainty that whatever is associated with Thy holy Being is far superior to and exalted above aught else that would satisfy them; inasmuch as Thine indomitabk power pervadeth all things, and nothing can ever frustrate it. Indeed Thou hast caused these momentous happenings to come to pass that those who are endued with perception may readily recognize that they were ordained by Thee to demonstrate the loftiness of Thy divine Unity and to affirm the exaltation of Thy sanctity.

 O Lord! Assist those who have renounced all else but Thee, and grant them a mighty victory. 

 Send down upon them, 0 Lord, the concourse of the angels in heaven and earth and all that is between, to aid Thy servants, to succour and strengthen them, to enable them to achieve success, to sustain them, to invest them with glory, to confer upon them honour and exaltation, to enrich them and to make them triumphant with a wondrous triumph. 

 Thou art their Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of all the worlds. Strengthen this Faith, 0 Lord, through the power of these servants and cause them to prevail over all the peoples of the world; for they, of a truth, are Thy servants who have detached themselves from aught else but Thee, and Thou verily art the protector of true believers. 

 Grant Thou, 0 Lord, that their hearts may, through allegiance to this, Thine inviolable Faith, grow stronger than anything else in the heavens and on earth and in whatsoever is between them; and strengthen, 0 Lord, their hands with the tokens of Thy wondrous power that they may manifest Thy power before the gaze of all mankind. 

 xv 0     LORD! Unto Thee I repair for refuge and toward all Thy signs I set my heart.

 Grant me then Thy sufficing help so as to make me independent of all things, 0 Thou Who art unsurpassed in Thy mercy! 

 Bestow upon me my portion, 0 Lord, as Thou pleasest, and cause me to be satisfied with whatsoever Thou hast ordained for me. 

 Thine is the absolute authority to command. 

  xv' 0     LORD! Thou art the Remover of every anguish and the Dispeller of every affliction. Thou art He Who banisheth every sorrow and setteth free every slave, the Redeemer of every soul. 0 Lord! 

 Grant deliverance through Thy mercy and reckon me among such servants of Thine as have gained salvation.

  3. 'ABDU'L-BAIIA Excerpts from Fire and Light1 0     LORD! These pure souls have ascended unto the realms on high. They have proved themselves nimble and sprightly in Thy service.  They rid themselves of all, drew nigh unto Thee, and reached the Fountainhead of eternal life. They have now taken their flight from this world on the wings of Longing and have attained Thy kingdom of glory. Gladden Thou their hearts in the world of the unseen and let them abide beneath the shadow of the tree of hope. Bestow upon them Thine infinite mercy and grant them Thy boundless pardon. Make them the signs of Thy forgiveness and the manifestations of Thy forbearance and bounty. 

 Verily Thou art the Bestower, the Loving, the One Who forgiveth the sins of men. 

  0    LORD! These stainless souls grew contemptuous of the world of dust and have ascended unto Thy kingdom. From this dreary world they have winged their flight unto the realm of resplendent glory. Weary and dejected they languished in this puny nest, eagerly waiting to set out for their celestial habitation. 

 They moved swiftly and sped forth on their flight until they attained unto 

Thee. 0 Forgiving One!     
Grant them Thy forgiveness.

O   All-Loving One! Bestow 
upon them Thy tender care. 

0 All-Sufficing One!       

 Give them Thy bounty and be their comforter and companion. 

 Thou art the Pardoner, the Resplendent,  the Bestower, the Lord of

  0        Thou kind Lord! These

 souls are the birds of Thy meadows, the nightingales of Thy rosegarden. Let them dwell within the orchard of Thy forgiveness and grant them access to the concourse wherein Thine eternal glory shineth resplendent, wherein Thy divine beauty is unveiled and perpetual communion with Thee is assured. Enable them to live eternally and to endure forevermore. 

 Thou art the Forgiving, the Bountiful, the All-Loving. 

  o     THOU kind Lord! From the horizon of detachment Thou hast manifested souls that, even as the shining moon, shed radiance upon the Tealm of heart and soul, rid themselves from the attributes of the world of existence and hastened forth unto the kingdom of immortality. 

 With a drop from the ocean of Thy loving kindness Thou didst ofttimes moisten the gardens of their hearts until they gained incomparable freshness and beauty. The holy fragrance of Thy divine unity was diffused far and wide, shedding its sweet savours ovdr the entire world, causing the regions of the earth to be redolent with perfume. 

 Raise up then, 0 Spirit of Purity, souls who, like those sanctified beings, will become free and pure, will adorn the world of being with a new raiment and a wondrous robe, will seek no one else but Thee, tread no path except the path of Thy good-pleasure and will speak of naught but the mysteries of 

Thy Cause.

 that this youth may attain unto that which is the highest aspiration of the holy ones. Endow him with the wings of Thy strengthening grace — wings of detachment and divine aid — that he may soar thereby into the atmosphere of Thy tender mercy, be able to partake of Thy

  celestial bestowals, may become a sign of divine guidance and a standard of the Concourse  on high. 

 Thou art the Potent, the Powerful, the Seeing, the Hearing. 
                           
        He is God                  

  o    REMNANTS of the martyrs in the path of God! 

 Your letters have been received and despite the lack of a moment's spare time they were perused with the utmost attention. 

 Since it is impossible to answer each letter separately, I am writing you collectively, and this you will surely excuse. 

 Indeed as a result of the outrages perpetrated by the wicked, the attacks of the rapacious beasts and the onslaught of the ravening wolves, those blessed souls have endured woeful tribulations and have borne dire sufferings and distressing calamities, each of which calleth for weeping and wailing, for sighing and lamentation. 

 Were eyes to shed tears of blood, they would afford no consolation. 

 By reason of these tragic events 'Abdu'l-Baha is assailed by despondency and anguish and is beset by bitter sadness and grief. 

 However, when we ponder carefully it will be observed that these unceasing trials and afflictions, these successive ordeals, though they break one's back, crush one's strength, and exhaust one's endurance, are among the greatest gifts of God, the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, for He thereby accepteth the self-sacrifice which certain souls are prompted to make in His path, enabling them to attire their heads with the glorious crown of martyrdom  and to establish themselves upon the throne of everlasting sovereignty. 

 Such hath ever been the qualification of them that enjoy near access unto God, such are the attributes of the pure in heart. 

 This life will surely pass away like unto a fleeting shadow and the gay trappings of this earthly existence will soon be rolled up. 

 The cup of bitter death will be borne round and the fire of anguish and despair will be set ablaze. The foundation of human life will crumble and this clamorous outcry and tumult will be hushed to silence and stillness. 

 Rejoicings  will cease and pleasures will come to an end. The souls will set out empty-handed on their journey to the next world, compassed by intense grief and anguish. 

 Of the contemplations of bygone days, of the former life of comfort, joy and power not a single vestige will be left. 

 Utter perdition will prevail and everyone's grievous loss and deprivation will be laid bare. 

 However, such faithful friends as have laid down their lives as martyrs will be stirred by the waves of the ocean of ecstasy. They will be filled with joy and radiance through the revelation of heavenly glad-tidings, will receive  divine confirmations of lovingkindness and will be sustained by the wondrous blessings of the peerless Lord in such wise that they will be moved to say: 'Praise be unto God that during our lifetime in this mortal world we became the target of darts in the path of God and were exposed to the dire peril of arrows and spears. 

 Every day a shaft of cruelty was hurled at us, and every moment we drank our fill from the draught of affliction, till eventually  we hastened forth to the field of martyrdom  for the sake of His love, and offered up our hearts and souls in the path of the All-Merciful'. 

 Indeed at that moment such souls will rejoice with exceeding gladness and will be so carried away by the joyful tidings of God that they will wing their flight to the heaven of eternal glory with the utmost ecstasy, exultation  and spiritual blissfulness. 

 It is Our ardent hope now that We too may partake of a drop from this celestial cup and may receive a portion from this life-giving draught. Verily my Lord will vouchsafe His special favours unto whomsoever He pleaseth. No God is there but Him, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. 

 Now praise be to God that the remnants of the families of the martyrs stand like a mighty structure, firm, steadfast and immovable. Before the eyes of the peoples of east and west they have proved themselves to be wholly self-sacrificing, eager to rush forth to the field of martyrdom, denizens of the kingdom of His love, seated upon the throne of eternal glory, knights of the arena of sacrifice, and rulers of the realm of renunciation and constancy. 

 Therefore ye should not be sad or sorrowful, nor be oppressed with grief and despondency.


<p22>
22                  THE BAHA'! WORLD

  Rather it behoveth you to render Him thanksgiving for being the survivors of those illustrious souls, the remnants of them that are favoured at the Threshold of the Almighty. In truth these calamities and sufferings are a glorious diadem whose glittering gems will shed lustre upon ages and centuries to come. 

  He is the All-Glorious 0   YE friends of God! 0 ye favoured ones at the Threshold of the One Who transcen-deth  all limitations! 

 That distinguished martyr, like unto a lucky star, shineth from the dawning-place of divine unity, luminous, resplendent and unmistakable, though mortal eyes are debarred from beholding him. 

 With his face beaming with light, with a luminous brow and enthralling beauty, he is calling aloud from the summit of the heaven of glory, saying: '0 my friends! 0 honoured ones! I quaffed the cup that brimmeth over with the consummate  bounty of God and tasted the sweetness of the Abhd Kingdom even from the edge of the sword. I have divested myself of my wornout  garments and raised up my banner in the realm of glory. From the world of dust till the heights of the heavens I spurred on the charger of martyrdom and from this luminous horizon I call out and say: "'0 my loved ones! The portals of His most great favour are flung open and the hearts of the people of BaiTh are dilated with joy. The chalice of His bounty is being borne round and the sweet melodies of the birds of the all-highest  Paradise reach every receptive ear. The reviving breeze wafting from the garden of the Abh6 Kingdom is laden with perfume and everyone who hath suffered long is granted intimate communion within the retreats of the Lord of Truth. From the Threshold of the Almighty, the All-Wise, His summons hath gone forth unto all men, and from the realm of the Concourse on high the voice of glad-tidings: Happy are ye! is continually raised."' Know ye the excellence of this gracious favour, and esteem the value of this precious gift. 

 The outpourings of the mercy of God are copious like unto a boundless ocean and the manifold blessings of the Abh% Beauty are shed abroad even as the radiance of the shining moon. Were ye to know how great is the revelation of this bounty, how plenteous the gifts that have been vouchsafed, I swear by the ravishing beauty of the Abh6 Beloved and by the soul-stirring smile of that peerless Charmer of hearts, that ye would dance with delight in your eagerness to lay down your lives and would leap with joy as ye hasten to the field of sacrifice. 

 Ye would raise, with one band the brimful cup of self sacrifice, and with the other the laurel of the supreme bounty successfully won. Thus in the arena of renunciation  while uttering the triumphal cry: Great is our blessedness! 

 Great is our blessedness! Happy are we! Happy are we! 

 ye will attain the desire of your hearts, the most glorious martyrdom. 

 0 ye friends of my heart and soul! Slumber not for a moment; relax not nor linger for an instant. 

 In a spirit of exceeding joy and gladness, with unswerving constancy in the Covenant and the Testament of the ever-forgiving Lord and in anticipation of attaining His luminous horizon, make the greatest effort to diffuse His sweet savours and bend your energies to promote His Cause. Be ye heralds of the Covenant, and bearers of the glad-tidings of 

His Testament. Receive     

 your portion from the breast of His grace, and with high resolve exert your utmost endeavour. 

 Be set aglow with the fire of the love of God, and raise the anthem of jubilation with the full enthusiasm of your heart and soul, so that ye may become intimately familiar with His Call and be initiated into divine knowledge and wisdom. 

 This world is the empire of the spiritual sovereignty of the Abh~ Beauty, and this realm is the seat where the mighty throne of the Kingdom of the 

Exalted One [the Bab      

 is established. Its effulgent sun, its shining moon never set, its brilliant stars never fade, its bright horizon is never overcast. 

 Its oceans surge and its birds soar in the heights. 

 Its streams are living waters, soft-flowing rivers of immortality. 

 Its trees are saplings planted in the orchard of the Lord of Glory. 

 Its dominion is the immensity of the realm of the placeless, and its territory the domain of the heart. Its abiding joy is attainment unto the presepec of the ever-forgiving Lord. Its sustenance


<p23>
THE BAHA'I REVELATION          23

  is the liberal bounty that His adored Beauty hath bestowed. Its chalice is the cup tempered at the Camphor Fountain, its designation, the Expanse of Eternal Life, a life that transcen-deth  the limitations of countless ages. 

 0     my friends! This is the Call of the Covenant. 

 This is the Dispensation of the Well-Beloved of all mankind. This is the gift that the DayStar of the world bath graciously given. 

 This is the revelation of Ills incorruptible grace, the manifestation of His perpetual assistance, the evidence of the power that is born of God and the potency of the bestowals proffered by the All-Merciful. 
What else do ye want?      
What else do ye expect?    
Which path do ye tread?    

 Be quick, be quick! 0 companions!  hurry, hurry! 
0 ye loved ones!           
   And upon ye be His glory!  
                           
           VII                        

  o     REMNANTS of those effulgent lights! O children of those tabernacles of holiness! 0 remembrances of those resplendent spirits! Although your distinguished fathers surrendered  their souls in the field of glorious martyrdom, hastened away from the abyss of this sordid world of dust unto the lofty heights of the Ablia Kingdom, and raised the banner of the most great bounty among the Concourse  on high, ye have not been left behind, forsaken and lonely. Although your fathers have ascended unto the realms above, Almighty 'God, more affectionate than a father, is ever present. 

 Indeed could ye but know how dear ye are in the presence of your true and heavenly Father, ye would stretch forth your wings and take your flight. 

 And upon ye, 0 loved ones of God, be His glory! 
                           
           VIII                       

  He is the All-Glorious o   OFFSHOOT of him who in a transport of delight drank of the chalice of martyrdom in the path of God! That essence of being is so graciously confirmed in this day with boundless  grace and favour at the court of the sovereign Lord of the seen and the unseen that the embodiments of spiritual majesty and the exponents of true glory are eagerly yearning  to render service unto him. Although to outward seeming he was put to a shameful death, in reality he is established upon the throne of unfading exaltation. 

 The day is approaching when kings will seek blessing from his dust and all heads will bow down in his honour, the day when all men will express humility at the revelation of the majesty and grandeur with which the martyrs are invested and all faces will be downcast before the indomitable power of their testimony. 

 If such is what will take place in this visible world, then imagine what it will be in the spiritual realms of God, so exalted above the comprehension  of all beings. 

  0  THOU who art seeking the good-pleasure  of the Lord of Glory! I have no time to spare. 

 I am completely absorbed in thinking of, in meditating upon and in lamenting for those distinguished martyrs — may My life be offered up as a sacrifice for them. 

 On the one hand this grievous calamity hath, like unto a dagger, inflicted upon me so' profound an injury that no salve can soothe, nor can any balm assuage; while on the other the scene of sacrifice is seen bedecked with such splendid pageantry, such marvellous festivity that the holy ecstasy of its wine seizeth forevermore the minds of those that are godly and spiritual. 

Moreover, the Concourse   

 on high and the dwellers in the Abh6 Kingdom are now expoundIng the mystery of sacrifice, the main purport of all heavenly Scriptures. 

 Therefore this hath to some degree relieved my grief. In short, the day is approaching  when the meads of the Cause of God, having been watered with blood, will have put forth roses and lilies in such profusion that East and West will become fragrant and North and 

South perfumed. Peace      
be upon you!               
                           
        He is God                  

  Q YE who have been wronged in the path of God! The loved ones of the Almighty have always been exposed to the dire oppression and tyranny of the people of iniquity, and His chosen ones have continually suffered woeful cruelties at the hand of the perfidious. 

 The friends of God have always quaffed the cup of adversity proffered by the hand of the immortal CupBearer. They have been made targets for the darts and spears of the curses,


<p24>
24                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  accusations and reviling that the rebellious and the wicked hurled at them, and have been persecuted and ill-treated by their opponents among the people of the world. Indeed these tribulations are the very draught with which the Well — Beloved of the world was inebriated and these calamities are but the effulgent light whereby the luminous brow of the DayStar of the world was illumined. 

 Therefore think not that this fierce opposition and cruelty hath brought humiliation and abasement upon you. Nay, I swear by God, besides Whom there is none other God, they redound to imperishable glory and unfading  bounty. 

 Indeed this persecution is a cooling draught and these trials a source of delight. This poison is but sugar and this venom the essence of sweetness. 

 This stab in the breast is a soothing balm to heart and soul, and this bitter medicine a healing remedy. One's sense of taste must be unimpaired to perceive its sweetness and to savour its relish. Otherwise to a bilious patient sugar and honey taste more bitter than venom, and to the diabetic a sweet drink is more harmful than deadly poison. 

 Meanwhile, 0 ye loved ones of God, let not these sufferings grieve you, nor let your hearts be sore with sorrow. Ere long will all take a pride in them and will seek distinction and glory in both worlds. One will say: In one period I endured hardships by reason of my faith and certitude in the one true God and was recompensed with certain bounties. Another  will state: Because of the love I cherished for the Best Beloved of the world, I once quaffed a deadly poison like unto a cup of eternal life and since then I have received His perpetual grace. Yet another will exclaim: In the path of servitude at the Threshold of the Almighty I was cast into prison and gained boundless favours in return. Another will declare: As a result of the illumination I received from the DayStar of ethereal glory I was made captive and held fast in chains and stocks, for which exceptional rewards were lavished on me. Another will say: My heart was set ablaze with the fire of His love in such wise that I hastened to the field of sacrifice, and kissed the edge of the sword. 

 Another will state: The blessed body of my illustrious father was hacked to pieces in the arena of sacrifice for the sake of my glorious 

Lord.                     

 Another will say: My honoured grandfatheT was inebriated with the cup of martyrdom which the CupBearer of God's eternal Covenant  proffered unto him and he became the recipient of manifold favours and bestowals. Still another will exclaim: Our blessed household was ruined in the path of the Adored One. And still another will exclaim: Our innocent ancestors were made homeless for having promoted the Word of God. In short everyone, well-pleased, jubilant and leaping with joy will recount these events at length and will glory in them before the other peoples and kindreds of the earth. 

 Then it will become unmistakably clear and manifest, even to outward seeming, what a great bounty, what a supreme blessing these afflictions and trials in the path of the Blessed Perfection had truly been. 

 Therefore it behoveth you, 0 loved ones of God, to raise up your hands in thanksgiving unto the Threshold of the pcerless One and say: 0 one and oniy God, 0 matchless Creator. Praised and glorified art Thou for having placed this splendid crown upon the brow of these helpless ones, and this mantle of eternal glory on the shoulders of these indigent ones. The rays of Thy sanctity fell upon bodies of clay and the lights of the world of eternity shone forth. A flame of Thy bestowal from the enkindled fire appeared and gave the hearts eternal life. 

 Thanks be to Thee for this blessing and this bestowal and this bounty with which Thou hast distinguished these helpless ones. Thou art the Generous, the Merciful and the All-Loving. 

  0 THOU who art resigned to His irrevocable  Decree! 

 Render thanks unto God for having attained  so sublime a station. Thou art treading the path of His good-pleasure; thou hast surrendered thyself unreservedly to that which is ordained and destined by Him; thou hast placed thy whole trust in Him and manifested unswerving constancy and fortitude in the face of this grievous calamity. Thus indeed doth it beseem the loved ones of God to conduct themselves, so that when they are beset by hardships or hemmed in by dire affliction they

THE BAHA'I REVELATION           25

  may be able to comfort others and impart consolation unto them, their faces may glow with the light of radiant acquiescence and they may deliver to the flames the veil of moaning, sighing and lamentation, inasmuch as resort to sadness and grief in the midst of tribulation is but an indication of lack of assurance and certitude. 

 In truth were man to attain the stage of certitude in his spiritual development, no affliction  could ever depress his spirits, though he would undoubtedly be influenced by reason of his human susceptibilities. 

 Nevertheless, man's inner being will be so revived by the breeze of divinely-ordained woes and trials that the dust of wailing and lamentation will entirely subside  and the light of submissive resignation unto Ills Will shall shine forth like unto a radiant morn. 

 And upon thee be greetings and praise. 
                           
           XII                        

  He is the All-Glorious o     YE who are inebriated with the draught of His 

Covenant!                  

 It is time to pass beyond the desolate wilds of remoteness, so that ye may reach the retreats of the Beloved, drink your fill from the wine of the bestowals of the All-Merciful, hold a heavenly festival, deck forth the stage for a spiritual celebration and, to the strains of harp and lute and the melodies of the Concourse  on high and of the songsters in the meads of holiness, break into sweet lays and wondrous tunes in praise and glorification of the AbhA Beauty. 

 0 ye friends of God! Let not the cavils of the foolish grieve you nor the tribulation of this world dismay you. Indeed, the motivating impulse whereby the sweet savours of God are diffused throughout the world is none but the suffering that befalleth His loved ones and the dire troubles that constantly touch His chosen ones. 

 Consider a while, the greater the affliction they suffered, the higher was raised the banner of devotion and faithfulness, and the more grievous the trials they endured, the more abundant were the outpourings of grace from the Abha Beauty. For it is during the darksome night that the radiance of light is conspicuous and the illumination of the lamp most perceptible. Therefore enlightened faces when exposed to dire hardships shine forth with the utmost radiance and brightness, and the hearts of His chosen ones when held in chains and fetters are filled with exceeding joy, gladness and ecstasy. 

    In the Qayyumu'1-AsmA      

 the Exalted One [the Bab addresseth the Abha Beauty in these words: '0 Thou our great and omnipotent Master! I have sacrificed myself wholly for Thee and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in Thy path.' Ponder ye carefully. The highest aspiration cherished by Him Who is the Leader of the righteous and the DayStar  of divine splendour was to lay down His life for the sake of the One Who doeth whatsoever He willeth. Thus it is clear and manifest what should be the supreme aspiration  and longing of the loved ones of 

God.                       

 And upon ye be greetings and praise! 
                           
           XIII                       
                           
        He is God                  

  0     SERVANTS of the one true God! 0 handmaids of the 

Merciful!                  

  'From the outset love was rebellious and bloodthirsty, So as to put every stranger to flight.' 

  One of the requisites of true love is willingness to bear every suffering and tribulation that hath occurred in the past or may occur in the future. 

 Hence a passionate lover is always stained with blood, and he that yearneth to meet the Beloved a constant wanderer. How well is it said: 'The    worldly wise who garner the ears of grain are unaware of LayI6's secret, For unto    none was accorded the great glory but Majn6n —  he who set the whole harvest afire.' 

  Thus throughout all ages and centuries the righteous have been made a target to the darts of adversity and have fallen victim to the swords of oppression. 

 At one time they quaffed the cup of dire ordeal, at another they tasted the venoffi of bitter woe. Not for a moment did they enjoy rest and comfort, nor did they repose for a fleeting breath upon the couch of tranquillity. Rather did they endure agonizing torment and patiently carry the


<p26>
26                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  burden of hardship that every oppressor was wont to impose upon them. 

 Having been consigned to dungeons and prisons, they severed themselves from the world and all its peoples. 

 In this way most of the favoured ones of God offered up their lives as martyrs in the field of sacrifice. 

 He Who is the resplendent Morn of divine guidance, the 

Exalted One [the Bab     

 sank below the horizon of sacrifice. Quddils sought companionship with the Beloved  through glorious martyrdom. Mull4 Husayn opened a new gate to the field of martyrdom. 

 Vahid distinguished himself as a peerless figure in the arena of sacrifice. 

 Zan-jdni  [Hnjjatj offered up his life as a martyr upon the plain of tribulation. 

 The King of Martyrs hastened forth to the place of sacrifice.  The Beloved of Martyrs was enraptured with ineffable gladness when he offered up his life for the sake of God. 

 Ashraf attained the heights of honour as he unflinchingly set his face towards the arena of sacrifice. BadP, as he breathed his last, exclaimed: 'Magnified be my Lord, the Most Glorious!' 

 The martyrs of the land of Y~ [Yazd] drank their fill with relish from the draught of glorious martyrdom,  and the martyrs of Shfr6z laid down their lives in the arena of ardent love to the tune of sweet and wondrous melodies. 

 Those massacred  in the hind of Nayrfz were inebriated with the brimful cup of sacrifice, and the martyrs of Tabriz were seized with ecstatic joy and unleashed new energies in the field of sacrifice. Those who renounced their lives in M~zandarAn exclaimed: ~O Lord! Destine for us this cup that brimmeth over with the choice wine'; while the martyrs of I~fah6n laid down their lives with utmost joy and radiance. 

 In brief, there is not a spike whose tip is not tinged with the blood of the martyrs, nor is there a place not dyed crimson with the blood of His ardent lovers. The purpose is to enable you to know that one of the tenets of those that thirst after Him and the highest aspiration of such as long to behold His face is to endure hardship, to submit to trials and martyrdom in the path of the Lord of grace. 

 Therefore it behoveth you to render thanks unto God for the bounty of having drunk your fill from this draught and for having tasted deadly poison in the path of the Best-Beloved. 

 Indeed far from being a poison this is pure honey and sugar, and far from being bitter in taste, this is the essence of sweetness. 

 0, how eager am I to bear affliction in the path of God! 0, what a great joy to suffer hardship for His love! 0, how blessed the man who tasteth the bitterness of woe, and how well is it with him who is swept into the ocean of tribulation in his eagerness to attain the presence of God! It behoveth you to offer thanksgiving at every moment, inasmuch as ye became the target of atrocities in the path of divine guidance and were exposed to grievous oppressions for the sake of the love ye cherish for the Almighty. 

 In truth those that are guided solely by their reason would be unable to perceive the sweetness of this cup, but the ardent lOvers will be overjoyed and enraptured by the holy ecstasy which this wondrous draught doth produce. Every discerning observer who hath gazed upon the countenance of that graceful Beloved was prompted to lay down his life as a martyr, and every receptive ear which had hearkened unto that celestial melody suffered its listener to become so enravished with joy as to offer up himself without hesitation as a sacrifice. The moth which is animated by love will burn its wings as it flitteth round the lamp of God and the phoenix of tender affection will be set ablaze by the fire of ardent desire. No unfamiliar bird can partake of the beat of this Fire, nor can the fowls that dwell upon the dust plunge forth into this heavenly Ocean. However, praise be unto God, ye are the leviathans of this ocean, the birds of this pasture, the moths of this lamp, the ni~htin-gales of this meadow. 

 And upon ye rest the glory of the Most Glorious! 
                          
           XIV                       
        He is God                 

  0     FAITHFUL friends in the AbbA Beauty! By reason of the oppression and atrocities that have befallen those two souls whom the people of the world have wronged ye have raised the cry of lamentation and grieving and have wept and sighed bitterly. This is meet and right for those two gazelles of the meadow of oneness were held fast in the talons of ferocious beasts, and those two nightingales of the rosegarden of divine unity

  were gripped in the claws of depraved ravens. There is no doubt that as a result of those dire woes and sufferings the hearts of the friends of God have been set aflame like unto a candle and they bemoan their grief with tearful eyes. 

 I swear by God besides Whom there is none other God, were ye to scrutinize carefully, ye would observe that every tree, every rock or clod of earth hat wept sore over this grievous injustice and hostility, and is wasted away by reason of this world-consuming fire. 

 Indeed those wronged ones had never hurt the feelings of even a moth, nor had they ever put forth the hand of molestation toward a helpless ant. They were innocent of any crime and sought no refuge except the threshold of the Ever-Living, 

Self-Subsisting Lord.      

 They had committed no error save that of having shaken off their slumber, and had incurred no guilt but that of becoming captive to His musk-laden tresses. Their grave offence was to display a glimpse of the beauty of the heavenly Peacock. 

 To do this they spread out the plumage of sanctity and intoned sweet melodies even as the warbling of a nightingale.  This was the only guilt they had committed;  their faithfulness was regarded as a crime, and their sincerity as deceit. 

 Yet notwithstanding their manifold expressions of love and fellowship, the ravening wolves attacked those two radiant, Joseph-like beings and ripped open not oniy their shirts but their breasts. Indeed so vehement was their hatred and rancour that they unhesitatingly shed their sacred blood. Ere long will God punish those wicked-doers, both in this world and hereafter for that which they have wrought and will bring dire humiliation upon them in this life and in the next. Verily God is the Avenger, the Almighty. 

 As to those blessed souls: they will, even as the doves of holiness, wing their flight unto the Concourse on high and in the meads of the Abh~ Kingdom will burst into melodious songs, whose strains of sanctity will exhilarate every attentive ear, and whose wondrous accents will be heard at all times by the people of abiding faithfulness. 

 What gift is there greater than this? What blessing is mightier than shedding these few drops of blood in the path of the peerless Lord? What felicity is more meritorious than the bounty of being aided by the mystery of sacrifice to consecrate themselves to the love of the Abh6 Beauty? May my life be offered up for those two martyrs; may my whole being be sacrificed for their sake; may my heart be laid down as a ransom for them. Verily, this is a supreme favour, this is a most glorious felicity. 

 And upon you be salutation and praise. 

  IN these days when the wicked have created violent disturbances and the opponents have bestirred themselves, they have, in every region stretched forth the hand of aggression and raised the banner of injustice and animosity. 

 In every locality they have launched attacks against the oppressed. 

 As is currently known this grievous assault hath assumed nationwide proportions. 

 In IsfaMn they aroused a great commotion; in Rasht the foundations of the city were shaken, and in Qazvin they committed manifest atrocities. 

 Indeed throughout the country agitation is aroused through vehement hostility and dust is stirred up by a raging tempest of hate. 

 And all this notwithstanding that everyone  is fully aware that the friends of God are those whom the people of the world have oppressed, and they who are the well-wishers of all kindreds and nations. 

 They tread the path of righteousness and seek to foster amity and fellowship with all mankind. They are contemptuous of their own selves, and inebriated with the wine of the love of the Almighty. They are sincere and steadfast, shining and radiant. They speak forth, they are competent. They defend the helpless, and are a refuge to the fugitive, an asylum to the poor, a haven for the distressed, a remedy for the afflicted and a balm to the wounds of the needy. They eagerly seek to live in perfect peace with the warlike and quarrelsome tribes, and to those who oppose them, they show forth composure, serenity and kindness. 

 Be not saddened and grieved by reason of the atrocities the enemies have perpetrated. The day is fast approaching when the light of love will have dispelled the darkness of animosity and the splendours of the sun of truth will have driven away the gloomy night. This spirit of heavenly fellowship, this uprightness  of the friends of God will promote


<p28>
28                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the wellbeing and tranquillity of all mankind. Warring factions will become peaceful, opposing  kindreds friendly, hostile peoples reconciled  and aggressive nations united. This is the imperishable glory of the human world. This is the supreme illumination in the kingdom  of the 

Lord of Mercy.             
                           
           XVI                        

 He is the All-Glorious 0  YE wronged captives! 

 The divines in that land have put forth the hand of aggression and have surpassed in cruelty the Pharaohs who executed their victims upon the stakes, and the people of Nimrod Thamad and 'Ad. They have closed the eye of justice and with the darts of tyranny have pierced the hearts of the oppressed. They have set on fire the harvest of the wronged ones, and deemed it expedient to inflict upon them every cruelty, molestation and torture, that perchance by so doing the divinely kindled fire might be extinguished, the seething and roaring of the ocean of God's bounty might subside, the outpourings of the clouds of His lovingkindness be stopped, the meteor of heavenly guidance be hindered from shedding its radiance upon those regions,  the reviving breezes of divine blessing which blow from the direction of His tender mercy be withheld, the fragrance of the rose of His gracious providence may no longer be diffused from the garden of divine unity, the light of its brilliant orb be obscured, and the secrets of the manifestation of heavenly bestowals be forgotten. 

 Alas! Alas! Those divines are unaware that the waves of the ocean of glory will surge high and the pervasive power of the Cause of God will acquire unprecedented glory. 

 Its orb will shine resplendent and the effulgent light of its meteor will perm~ate the world. Its spark will develop into a flame, its luminous star into a sun, and its drop into a downpour and a flood. Its grain will grow into a harvest, its glittering gem will sparkle in every gathering, its fame will be noised abroad, and the anthem of its glorification will reach the highest heavens. 

 As to these servants and homeless ones: We were so inebriated with our fill from the draught of the love of God that we yearned to drink, deep of that wine of God's 

Covenant.                  

 Thus chalice in hand, dancing and leaping with joy, we hastened into the arena of sacrifice. 

 We offered supplications begging for adversity. 

 We exposed our breasts as a target for the shafts of oppression and with the whole affection of our hearts and souls we welcomed the sword of injustice. 

 This body is the abode of ills and this darkened self a cage to every warbling bird. One's corporeal frame shall become dust and a target to dreadful darts. Therefore if it were offered up in the field of sacrifice for the sake of God, no favour or blessing could be greater than this. Earthly possessions will certainly be lost, and what hath been accumulated will be dispersed; excessive riches will be cast adrift, and the flush of fortune will wither away and fade into nothingness; immense treasures will be squandered and the wealth gathered up by the wind will eventually be blown away by the wind. 

 Hence, better is it for one's riches to be pillaged and plundered in the path of God, than be a booty of the changes and chances of the world. 

 As to lofty buildings, imposing mansions, and magnificent palaces: every inhabited and flourishing place will become desolate and every mighty edifice reduced to ruin. Therefore, how much better it is for these habitations which are more fragile than a spider's web to be wrecked and ruined for the Love of the sovereign Lord of the Kingdom. For if a house of clay be destroyed, there will be reared in its stead a glorious mansion within the soul-uplifting immensity of the realms above. If one's home and dwelling-place be laid waste in this transitory dust-heap, one will be provided with a matchless and incomparable nest within the rosegarden of eternity. 

 Thus all that is related to the loved ones of God, their former glory, their present services, the grievous sufferings they have borne — all will, even as carving on slabs of emerald, be recorded on the scrolls of the Abhh Kingdom, and therefrom will they shed their radiance upon all the worlds of God. Then when that light sheddeth its rays upon the tongues of the world of existence, it giveth rise to expressions of praise and glorification; when directed towards human hearts, it evoketh the memory of noble traits, deeds and virtues; when reflected upon the pages of the world, it becometh the object of the verse: 'and give

        He is God                 

  o     SERVANT of Bah& It behoveth thee to render thanks unto the Threshold of the Lord of Oneness for the afflictions that have befallen  thee, inasmuch as the adversities that are borne in the path of the one true God are but the revelations of His tender mercy, and any such tribulation is the essence of His bounty. 

 This life is like unto vapour in a desert and the existence of every thing is as a mere illusion, evanescent and bound to extinction. That which endureth is the spiritual reality, it is the shining essence; it is life eternal, it is undisturbed felicity, unfading and perpetual, flourishing and plenteous. The revolution of cycles is powerless to ravage it, nor can the succession of ages and centuries molest it. Therefore, this divinely-ordained reality, this heavenly sign, must needs be preserved. 

 And the amazing thing is this that the most effective means whereby this Light of truth is safeguarded and protected is the onslaught of the enemies, grievous ordeals and manifold hardships. The globe of this lamp is the tempestuous winds and the safety of this ship lieth in the violence of tumultuous waves. 

 Therefore one must show forth gratitude in the face of Job-like afflictions and must evince joy and pleasure at the unyielding cruelty of evildoers, inasmuch as such tribulations lead to immortality, and serve as the supreme factor to attract His consummate blessings and infinite bestowals. 

 And upon thee be the glory of the Most Glorious.

        He is God                 

  0     SPIRITUAL friends and loved ones of the All-Merciful! 

 In every Age believers are many but the tested are few. Render ye praise unto God that ye are tested believers, that ye have been subjected to every kind of trial and ordeal in the path of the supreme Lord. In the fire of ordeals your faces have flushed aglow like unto pure gold, and amidst the flames of cruelty and oppression which the wicked had kindled, ye suffered yourselves to be consumed  while remaining all the time patient. Thus ye have initiated every believer into the ways of steadfastness and fortitude. You showed them the meaning of forbearance, of constancy, and of sacrifice, and what leadeth to dismay and distress. This indeed is a token of the gracious providence of God and a sign of the infinite favours vouchsafed by the Abh6 Beauty Who bath singled out the friends of that region to bear grievous sufferings in the path of His love. 

 Outwardly they are fire, but inwardly light and an evidence of His glory. Ye have been examples of the verse: 'Let them that are men of action follow in their footsteps.' 'And to this let those aspire who aspire unto bliss.'2 In short, the day is approaching when the gay trappings of this earthly Life will have been rolled up and the sorry plight and adversity of the people of iniquity will have waxed more grievous than those experienced by the oppressed.  The inmates of palaces will have been subjected to the confinement of graves, and such as occupy the seats of honour will have fallen upon the dust of misery and abasement. 

 However, those who have offered up their lives as martyrs will shine resplendent even as a candle, and the effulgent glory of the friends of God will shed its radiance from the horizon of eternity like unto a brilliant star. Behold how wondrous is the bounty whereufito ye have attained. Ye have followed the example set by Him Whom the world hath wronged. Like unto the DayStar of the world ye have outwardly suffered an eclipse by reason of the injustice the people of malice have wrought. However, far from an eclipse, this is naught but splendour; far from concealment, this is naught but the defeat of the legions. 

 Ere long ye shall behold the shining light of the one true God shedding its radiance upon the whole world, while the heedless ones find themselves in the darkness of extinction. 

 In the estimation of the loved ones of God abasement is exaltation itself, and affliction

  leadeth to faithfulness. 

 Earthly glory and comfort are but a mirage of illusion, while in the realm of the spirit heavenly gifts are everlasting and imperishable. 

 The lights in the nether world may be bright, but they are put out at the break of dawn, whereas the stars that shine in the heaven of the love of God will sparkle continually throughout ages and centuries. 

 Such is everlasting glory; such is infinite bounty; such is life eternal; and such is boundless grace. 

 And upon you rest salutation and praise. 
                          
           XIX                       

  THE legions of the world cannot withstand this mighty Army. Its weapons are divine knowledge and assurance, and its sword is its world-encircling light. Physical powers are capable of resisting earthly armies, but are impotent before the onslaught of the hosts of heaven. 

 Thousands of times this hath been tried and proven. 

 The wicked people of Thamfid who manifested  fierce hostility towards Sdlih were unable to withstand His indomitable power. Likewise, the tribes of 'Ad perpetrated revolting  outrages, but the spiritual sword of H6d remained unsheathed and the divinely-kindled light proved unquenchable. 

 Although the clash of the arms of the wretched Nimrod reached the ears of all peoples, he failed to suppress the glory of Abraham. The misguided Copts marshalled their troops against Moses, yet could not engage Him in battle. The Jews who gainsaid God's Cause aroused violent commotion, regarded the Beauty of the 

Promised One [Jesus]      

 as a fire no longer bright, stined up fierce opposition and launched a campaign of attacks and aggression against Him, but in the end their opposition proved of no avail. The leaders of 1-JijAz inflicted griev-OHS  ordeals and atrocities upon the Prince of Mecca [Muhammad], tormented and injured Him as much as it lay in their power, until their assaults grew so vehement that the Lord of the righteous migrated unto Medina where He proclaimed the Word of God. Later various kindreds and peoples leagued themselves  together, waged tribal war and encircled that focal Centre of Light from every direction, but failed to subdue Him. 

 This is but a brief account of past experiences. 

 Nevertheless it is highly deplorable that subsequent generations, wholly unaware of this outstanding truth, still seek to oppose the Beauty of the Promised One with utter heedlessness. 

 They have armed themselves with a myriad darts of iniquity and swords of transgression  and are engaged in unrelenting attacks. Ere long will they realize the grievous mistake they have committed. 

 They seek to compress the unlimited ocean; they try to stop forthwith the wondrous outpourings of the vernal showers. 

 But alas for them! The reviving breeze that bloweth from the direction of the Abh6 Kingdom cannot be halted and the musk-laden fragrance of faithfulness that wafteth from the rosegarden of the All-Glorious can never be arrested. 

 During the ministry of Christ the Cause of God did not pass beyond the regions of Jerusalem. 

 Whatever else was achieved came afterwards. Likewise in the days of the Prince of Mecca — may the souls of the favoured ones of God be offered up for His sake — the reputation of His sublime Faith was confined to the boundaries of Hij~iz. However, the fame of this glorious Cause reached the east and the west during the lifetime of the Blessed Beauty, and Tablets were revealed for the crowned heads of the world. 

 This blameworthy people have already heard and Learned how the wicked grievously failed in their opposition towards the Prince of the righteous, yet they are still heedless. 

 This blessed, this mighty Cause which hath stirred the whole earth to its foundation, cannot be restrained by the hostility that these bands of weaklings have unleashed. Ere long will they find themselves in manifest loss. 

  IN/JAY my life be offered up for the dust of these martyrs; may my entire being be a sacrifice for the blood of the chosen ones of God, they who enjoy near access to His exalted Threshold, who are attracted to the summit of transcendent glory, and established upon the seat of truth in the all-glorious Kingdom. 

 0 ye who have suffered martyrdom! 0 trustees of His Revelation! 0 distinguished men of virtue! 

 0 illustrious and noble ones! May my inmost reality, my spirit, my entire

 I bear witness that ye are the radiant stars, the gleaming meteors, the resplendent full moons, the brilliant orbs in this wondrous Revelation. 

 Well is it with you, 0 birds that warble in the gardens of divine unity; blessed are ye, 0 lions that roar in the forests of detachment; happy are ye, 0 Leviathans that swim in the waters of His oneness. Verily ye are the signs of divine guidance, ye are the banners that flutter in the field of sacrifice. 

 I beseech God to bless me, through the breezes of holiness wafted from that glorious centre of sacrifice, and to quicken me with the reviving breath of heavenly communion blowing  from that blessed region. 

 I beg you to intercede on my behalf in the presence of the ever-living, sovereign Lord that He may graciously suffer me to quaff my fill from the choice sealed wine, may grant me a portion from the unbounded felicity that ye enjoy and may exhilarate my heart by giving me to drink from your chalice which is ternpered at the Camphor Fountain. 

 Verily my Lord is merciful and forgiving. By bestowing the bounty of sacrifice in this realm of ens-tence, He aideth whomsoever He willeth with whatsoever He pleaseth. 

 And upon you rest the glory of the Most Glorious!

EXCERPTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF

                   SHOGHI EFFENDI

  Excerpts from Fire and Light1 I Fin the days to come should adversities of various kinds encircle that land and national upheavals aggravate its present calamities intensliy the repeated afflictions, and darken still more the horizons of that great country, you should not feel sorrowful and grieved, nor be deflected even to the extent of a hair's breadth from your straight path and chosen highway, which is to vigilantly and persistently exert your utmost efforts to increase the number of your institutions, to consolidate their foundations, to proclaim their existence and to add to their fair name and glory. 

 The liberation of this meek and innocent band of His followers from the fetters of bondage and the talons of the people of tyranny and enmity must needs be preceded by the clamour and agitation of the masses. The realization of glory, of tranquillity, and of true security for the people of Bah6 will necessitate opposition, aggression and commotion  on the part of the people of malevolence  and iniquity. 

 Therefore, should the buffeting waves of the sea of tribulation intensify and the storms of trials and tribulations  assail that meek congregation from all six sides, know of a certainty and without a moment's hesitation that the time for its deliverance has drawn nigh, that the age-old promise of its assured glory will soon be fulfilled, and that at Long last the means are provided for the persecuted people of BaM in that land to attain salvation and supreme triumph. A firm step and an unshakeable resolve are essential so that the remaining All but No. I are excerpts translated by Mr. Habib Taherzadeh, with the assistance of a Committee at the Baha World Centre, from Fire and Light [A/dr va

BaM and Shoghi Effendi.   

 stages may come to pass and the cherished ideals of the people of Bah6 may be realized on the loftiest summits, and be made manifest  in astounding brilliance. 'Such is God's method, and no change shalt thou find in His method. 

 '2 IN this stern battle of life the members of this oppressed community, aided by the power of the Kingdom, and fortified by heavenly determination, by divinely-imparted hopes and by glad-tidings from on high, are standing ready and alert to face any commotion  or calamity. 

 Unrelenting tribulations and increasing obstacles shall not make them flinch, nor cause them dismay or grief. They know with full certitude that as the horizons of the world grow darker, as its agitation becomes more severe and the prevailing chaos and confusion more widespread, the dawn of the Promised Day will correspondingly draw nearer, and the means for the splendours of His light to be shed abroad will be more readily provided. 

 However, the fulfilment of glad-tidings, so glorious and heart-uplifting, must needs be heralded by awesome and distressing events, inasmuch as the realization of these irrevocable and divinely-ordained promises depends on the awakening and the stirring of the conscience of the entire human race, while this cannot be achieved save through the occurrence of unnumbered afflictions, manifold  convulsions and growing adversities. 

 And it is precisely for this reason that the people of Baha are nourished from the draught of certitude and are alive and active through the spirit of hope. They strive diligently, are alert and watchful, steadfast and vigilant.

  heart and soul they exert their effortst They will not allow the pressure of calamities gradually to impair the foundation of the Cause of God, or vitiate the essence of its divinely-revealed principles; nor will they permit the wickedness and the prevalence of crime to nullify or eclipse the radiance of the cardinal laws of their Faith; or the aggressive hands of the opponents and the machinations of the ungodly to inflict harm upon this holy Revelation, or the confused theories and ideologies that prevail in these days to create the least deviation from the straight path of God... 
                           
           III                        

  o     GRIEF-STRICKEN and self-sacrificing souls! 

The Hand of Providence     

 has ordained that those innocent victims of tyranny should once again be oppressed in the clutches of the wrongdoers, and the Will of God, the Ever-Living,  the Almighty, has purposed that manifold tribulations and adversities should, like a torrential flood, descend successively upon that wronged community. In these years of dire stress our Lord, the All-Wise, has, as a preliminary measure for the fulfilment of His gracious pledge and in conformity with His undeviating principle, kindled a raging fire of trials in that country. 

 Be not sorely grieved or dismayed. This is an effective means, preordained and irrevocable, which has been provided by the Causer of causes, through the operation of His immutable Will, and the exercise of His unquestionable power, and in the face of the machinations of every malicious opponent, so that the glory of His Cause may presently be unveiled before the assemblage of man and, in the days to come, His Faith may be rendered victorious and become securely established in that blessed land. 

 Let nothing frustrate or discourage you. Immerse yourselves in the study of the Holy Tablets. I testify befqre God, Baha'u'llah asserts, to the greatness, the inconceivable greatness of this Revelation. Again~and again have We, in most of Our Tablets, borne witness to this truth, that mankind may be roused from its heedlessness. In another connection  this utterance has been revealed: How great, how very great is this Cause. The day is fast approaching when its stupendous glory will have been made manifest and evident. 

 This heavenly Faith cannot be compared to the transitory things of the world of existence, nor can it be identified with or likened to physical and earthly forces. Its tabernacle has been raised through dire oppression, its advancement  and promulgation depend upon spiritual and mysterious agencies, and factors that are awesome, alarming and totally unexpected.  The Tongue of the Ancient of Days, the Comforter of the people of the world says: Naught hath been ordained by the finger of His decree for His loved ones except that which is profitable unto them. We beseech Him to graciously enable them to show forth patience and fortitude that haply trials and ordeals might not deflect them from the path of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. 

 Through the insults and indignities suffered by the well-assured and faithful maidservants of God, portals of everlasting honour will be flung open before the face of the women in Persia, nay everywhere in the world, and as a result of the beatings, torture and cruelties inflicted upon the newly converted Baha'i youth, a new spirit of liveliness and freshness will stream forth through the veins and arteries of the temple of the 

Cause of God. The Lamentation

 of the disconsolate who have been made homeless as a result of this grievous event will reach the ears of the spiritually-minded in the west and its powerful repercussions will release a fresh energy in the world of existence, will forge new spiritual ties, and lay bare the essence of this heavenly Revelation before the eyes of all men, be they friends or strangers. 

 Although the sufferings that have befallen the friends during the past few years were not as frequent, as grievous and widespread as the successive waves of afflictions that have been let loose in recent months, yet notwithstanding  this and as a direct consequence of the pangs of anguish and devastating sorrow that have crushed the souls of the friends in Persia, the cherished Cause of God has blossomed forth astonishingly and is advancing with a fresh momentum throughout the five continents  of the globe. 

 While Persia remains heedless and unaware and its sorely-tried friends are beset by grievous repressions and cruelties, the hosts of

  life, the bearers of the divine Message of salvation are moving far and wide over the extensive territories of the free world, and bending their energies to capture the citadels of men's hearts. The motivating impulse, the driving power which is responsible for the successful achievements of these sanctified beings is derived from the heat and flame and the influence released through the relentless  persecutions and ordeals which the pure-hearted friends in Persia are enduring. Wherefore has the Master said: When the light of God is ignited in the East it will shed illumination upon the West and its evidences will become visible both in the North and in the South. 
    0 spiritual brethren!      

 Although the horizons of that country are dark, and manifold hardships and tribulations are continuous and unremitting; although the foundations of that realm are sorely shaken, and the minds of its people in a state of confusion; although there is no peace or protection for the righteous, and the unbelievers are relentless in their hatred and animosity, this anguish and distress, this abasement and ignorance will not endure, nor will this cruelty, captivity, agitation and disturbance persist. The day is fast approaching when God will have manifested from this horizon such light and power as will cause the sun to be darkened, will obliterate every trace of them that have turned away disdainfully from God, and will illumine the faces of the sincere. 

 It well beseems you to direct your eager gaze to the glad-tidings that have been revealed  by the Pen of the Most High and to let the shining prophecies that are contained in His Most Holy Book and in other Tablets illumine  your expectant eyes. Can one imagine a pronouncement sweeter, an utterance and promise more perfect, more appropriate, and more glorious than these conclusive verses that have streamed forth from the repository of the Abh6 Pen? Exalted is His Word: Let nothing grieve thee, 0 land of Td [Tihr6n],for God hath chosen thee to be the source of the ]oy of all mankind. He shall, if it be His Will •  gather together the flock of God which the wolves have scattered The eye of His lovingkindness shall everlastingly be directed towards thee. 

 The day is approaching when thy agitation will have been transmuted into peace and quiet calm. Moreover, the following significant and soul-stirring words have been set down by the Pen of the Centre of the Covenant: Ere long will it be witnessed that the government of the native land of the Blessed Perfection will become the most honoured government of this world, and Irdn will become  the most prosperous of all lands, this indeed is a token of God's bountiful favour, and verily in this is there a lesson unto every beholder. 

 Such God-given promises and sublime glad-tidings that the Pen of the Most High and the divinely-aided and inspired fingers of the Centre of the Covenant have inscribed will, according to the following blessed verse, be unquestionably fulfilled. How enthralling is His Word: Whatsoever hath streamed forth from the Pen of the Most High hath either already  occurred or shall assuredly come to pass. Not a single letter thereof will remain unrealized,  for verily the fair-minded shall behold it established upon the throne of fulfilment. 

 However, the essential thing is patience, fortitude, courage and audacity. 

 The day is approaching when that country will have turned into a blissful paradise, when the wronged ones of Persia will have become the pride of the world and the leaders of mankind. And this is a promise that will not be belied. 

  0 FOLLOWERS of the beloved 

Cause of Baha'u'llah!      

 Regard not the smallness of your numbers, nor be depressed and discontented by reason of the harm and injury that you sustain at the hands of friend or foe. Let not the vilifications, the whisperings and idle remarks of the foolish and the shortsighted grieve you, nor the vast array of the multitude of assailants frighten or alarm you. 

 These tribulations have time and again been foretold by our peerless Master. 

 The prophetic warnings that our supreme Lord has uttered clearly foreshadow the onslaught of the hosts of afffiction. Have you not heard what has flowed from the tongue of the Comforter of mankind in this connection? He says: 

Say:                       

 Tribulation is as water for that which We have planted in human hearts. The day is approaching  when out of it will have grown such fruit that every seed thereof will proclaim: Verily,


<p35>
THE BAHA'I REVELATION          35

  no God is there but Him, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. 

 And likewise He has said: Through adversity have We fostered the growth of the Faith of God in bygone ages. Ere long wilt thou witness this Cause shining resplendent above the horizon of glory, invested with ma]esty and power. 

 And also He affirms: God hath made tribulation as the crown wherewith the head of Baha is attired. 

 The time is at hand when its radiance will have enveloped the whole world. 

 By My life! Such tribulations as are sustained in the path of God, the Fashioner of all created things, are as cherished by Me as eyes are cherished by men, nay even more! Unto this thy Lord, the Mighty, the Unconstrained,  beareth witness. 
    0     apostles of Baha'u'llah!

 How pitiful if we, who are recognized as the bearers of His glorious Name, and related to such an omnipotent  Lord, should, in moments of adversity, fail to scrupulously follow the noble example set by Him Who stands peerless in His longsuffering. 

 Happy the one who until his last breath has tasted the venom of woe at the hand of the faithless, and blessed the heart that for the sake of promoting and proclaiming  His Cause does not allow himself a moment's rest. Such is the disposition of the pure in heart, such is the method of them that enjoy near access to God, such is the way of the true strivers after God, such befits the hosts that are under the guidance of God, such is the means whereby undoubted triumph and victory will be achieved for the Cause of God. 

 O     people of Baha! Lift up your voices, and hail men of wisdom with glad-tidings. 

 Call aloud between earth and heaven, exclaiming: 0 people of the world and workers of injustice and iniquity! Rest assured that we, the followers of the Abh2i Beauty, have paid for our Faith with our lifeblood, and have tasted the sweetness of sacrifice in the path of His love. Our trust in Him sustains our lives, enabling us to be detached from aught else but Him. We shall promote His Cause to the last breath and offer praise and gratitude at all times for the tribulations He ordains. 
    O     people of the earth! 

 Know you with absolute certainty, and let every wavering and hesitant soul be apprised and take warning, that whatsoever has explicitly been revealed by the All-Glorious Pen will eventually become clear and evident, even as the sun in its noontide glory. In this snow-white Spot, and in other lands, the immutable Will of Him Who has stretched out the earth and raised up the heavens, shall be fulfilled, the cherished desire of longing hearts will emerge from behind a myriad veils into the realm of existence, and the highest aspiration of the people of Baha will be fully, perfectly and conclusively realized. This is that which our Lord has promised us both openly and privily, and indeed this is a promise that will not prove untrue. 

 Therefore it beseems you to arise and exclaim: 0 concourse of the earth! 

 Die in your wrath. Ere long will the standard of His Faith be hoisted in every city, shedding radiance upon all regions. 
                           
        He is God                  

  0 MIGHTY Lord! Thou seest what hath befallen Thy helpless lovers in this darkest of long nights; Thou knowest how, in all these years of separation from Thy Beauty, the confidants of Thy mysteries have ever been acquainted with burning grief. 

    0     Powerful Master! Suffer

 not Thy wayfarers  to be abased and brought low; succour this handful of feeble creatures with the potency of Thy might. 

 Exalt Thy loved ones before the assemblage of man, and grant them strength. 

 Allow those broken-winged beings to raise their heads and glory in the fulfilment of their hopes, that we in these brief days of life may gaze with our physical eyes on the elevation and exaltation of Thy Faith, and soar up to Thee with gladdened souls and blissful hearts. 

 Thou knowest that, since Thy ascension, we seek no name or fame, that in this swiftly passing world we wish henceforth no joy, no delight and no good fortune. 

 Then keep Thy word, and exhilarate once more the lives of these, Thy sick at heart. Bring light to our expectant eyes, balm to our stricken breasts. 

 Lead Thou the caravans of the city of Thy love swiftly to their intended goal. 

 Draw those who sorrow after Thee into the high court of reunion with Thee. For in this world below we ask for nothing but the triumph of Thy Cause. And within the precincts  of Thy boundless mercy we hope for nothing but Thy presence.

36                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Thou art the Witness, the Haven, the Refuge; Thou art He who rendereth victorious  this band of the innocent. 

  THE assaults, onslaughts and attacks perpetrated by the people of arrogance and malice do not and will not endure. They shall, one and all, be dispelled at the appointed time, and no trace of them will be left behind. What will remain, and the influence thereof endure, are the wrongs suffered by the loved ones of God, the audacity they have evinced, the undaunted spirit manifested by the defenders  of the Faith of the All-Merciful, their bonds of unity and harmony, and their tenacious adherence and undeviating allegiance to the institutions of the Cause of God in that land. 

 At present the state of affairs is in turmoil tribulations are manifold and the authorities have launched attacks from every direction. However, the invisible Hand of God is at work and the wratliful Avenger is watching over the oppressed community of the righteous and the pious. Things that were hidden will be revealed and realities that were unknown will become clear and evident. The innocence of those longsuffering and sanctified beings will definitely be proved and established, and every act of injustice, of iniquity and malice wrought by the evildoers will be laid bare. The daystar of glory, as is prophesied, will shine forth from that land with such radiance that all men, high or low, of the rulers or the ruled, friend or foe, whether far or near, will be astonished and bewildered. 
     Now is the time for steadfastness.

 Now is the ripe moment for the stalwart warriors and champions to show forth courage and to demonstrate their heroism in the arena of service, until such time as God will exalt His Cause, will remove the distress and anxiety of His friends and trusted servants, and glorify those who were brought Low among His creatures, to make them spiritual leaders among men, and to make them God's heirs. 
                          
           VII                       

 THE shedding of innocent blood in that blessed land will produce marvellous results and from it far-reaching consequences will ensue in the course of time. The fierce storm of woes and calamities and the incessant waves of unnumbered trials and incalculable hardships which in recent days have encompassed  that small group from all sides are but the first glimmer, the dawning twilight heralding  the advent of the new age that has been foretold in the past. 

 This gloomy night which has lasted for a number of years has plunged every part and region of that country into darkness. The darker the night will turn, and the more intense and dreadful its convulsions and commotions become, the nearer will b~ the appointed time when the bright morn of deliverance will dawn, when the daystar of felicity and emancipation will shine, when the light of the glory, power and independence of the Faith of God will radiate with extraordinary brilliance, when phe fall and collapse, the destruction and ruin of the people of malice and iniquity in that land will become apparent and conspicuous. 

 The hosts of Bah6, the concourse of the sore-oppressed ones in that afflicted country, should all know with absolute certainty that the Cause of God is great, and its strengthening grace quickens every mouldering bone; its heavenly confirmations are ever present, and its adversaries on the offensive, Launching their attacks from all sides. 

 On the one hand they are seized with perturbation and alarm at th~ sight of the quaking of the foundations of their own structure, and its breakdown and collapse, while on the other hand they are amazed and bewildered at the people of Baha, and their high degree of tranquillity and firmness, and their longsuffering and unshakeable patience. 
   This is the day for steadfastness.

 Now is the time for defence and bravery, so that the evil ones who are lying in wait may be disconcerted,  defeated and put to flight, and the prophecies irrevocably decreed by God may be fulfilled without delay. 
                          
           VIII                      

  AIIITATIONS, trials, woes, afflictions, and torture, arson, expulsion, plunder, beating,  vilification, captivity, banishment, imprisonment,  destruction of life — none of these could hinder the advancement of this beloved

THE BAHA'I REVELATION          37

  Cause, none could weaken the high resolve of its followers and champions in any part of the world, none could damage or disrupt the structure of its New Order, none could create a cleavage, a division, a schism or any form of sectarianism in the ranks of its embattled hosts. 

 Nay rather, were one to observe with a discerning eye, it would become clear and evident that commotion in itself, the very succession of calamities, upheavals and hardships,  and the recurrence of trials, adversities  and sufferings have lent an impetus to the power latent in the Cause and reinforced its compelling force and pervasive influence. 

 Indeed as a result of the onrushing tempests of tribulation and the raging hurricanes of tests and trials, the Faith's scope of operation has been enlarged, its pillars have been raised to loftier heights, its foundation has become more secure, its glory more resplendent, the spread of its influence more rapid, its ascendancy and dominion more conspicuous and evident. 

 Every blow that the hands of the wrongdoer have inflicted upon the community of the followers of the Cause of God from without, has proved to be the means of a fresh victory and triumph for the Faith, and every agitation provoked from within through the intrigues and plottings of perfidious traitors has led to a remarkable success for the Cause and to the revelation of its wondrous glory These momentous events, these startling and awesome happenings that have transpired during the past hundred years confirm the truth of this most perfect, this consummate and enthralling utterance that has proceeded from the repository of the All-glorious Pen —  exalted is His saying and blessed 

His Word:                 

 From time immemorial have We reared the celestial Trees of divine Revelation with the waters of opposition and the shedding of blood, could ye but perceive it. Likewise He says: By the righteousness of God! This divine Tree will develop by means of the waters of your opposition; yet ye understand not and remain  heedless. 

 Moreover He affirms: Through affliction hath His Cause been promoted and His praise glorified. 

 In another connection this blessed verse has been revealed: Should they attempt to conceal its light on the continent it will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean and, raising its voice, proclaim: '1 am the life-giver of the world!' 

 The amazing history of this glorious century will conclusively demonstrate to every opponent  of the Cause throughout the world that violent upheavals have strengthened the root of this heavenly Tree, severe trials and hardships have reinforced the foundation of the divine Edifice. 

 Dire abasement became a vesture of glory, while adversity and tribulation were oil which fed the flame of the lamp of God's Revelation. Fierce attacks and violence  produced steadfastness and constancy, and persecution and privation created interest, and led to conversion and proclamation. Torment, repression and subjugation were means whereby the light of the ascendancy and triumph of this beloved Cause were eventually diffused far and wide. 

 Convulsions and commotions served in the long run to purify and strengthen the body of the Cause of God, while the clamour of the prattler, the uproar of the deceitful, the tumult of the froward were instrumental in raising high the melody of the Kingdom. The rending and tearing of veils caused such realities and mysteries as were latent in the inmost essence of God's Revelation to be uncovered and brought to light. 
Wherefore has the All-glorious 

Pen revealed: Through     

 their injustice we praised the Cause of God, and the anthem of praise, glorifying the Name of thy Lord, was broadcast in all countries. Through their rejection  the truth was recognized, and as a result of their cruelties the luminary of justice hath shone forth. Ponder a while, 0 men of understanding, that ye might perceive. 

Likewise  He states: At  

 one time He exalted His Cause by the hand of the people of tyranny, and at another by the hand of His chosen servants — they unto whom the heedless ones appear as but a handful of dust, they who declare that which the Pen of the Most High hat/i proclaimed from the horizon of glory. 

  CONSIDER what momentous glad-tidings the all-glorious Pen has announced in the holy Tablets, what explicit promises His exalted and irrevocable Pen has revealed. In the St2ratu'1-Haykal these gemlike words are recorded: He will, ere long, out of the Bosom


<p38>

  of Power, draw forth the Hands of Ascendancy and Might — Hands who will arise to win victory for this Youth and who will purge mankind from the defilement of the outcast and the ungodly. 

 These Hands will gird up their loins to champion the Faith of God, and will, in My Name the Self-subsistent, the Mighty, subdue the peoples and kindreds of the earth. They will enter the cities and will inspire with fear the hearts of all their inhabitants. Such are the evidences of the might of God; how fearful, how vehement is His might! 

 And likewise these luminous verses are inscribed in this holy Siirih: The day is approaching when God will have raised up, through Thee, such invincible Hands, such indomitable Helpers, who will emerge from behind the veils, will render victorious the All-merciful One amidst all the peoples of the world and will burst forth into such a cry as will leave its mark in all hearts. Thus hath it been decreed in the inscribed Tablet. 

 And they will appear with such power that all the dwellers of the earth will be seized with fear and every one will be sorely shaken. 

 Moreover He has written: Ere long will the Call be raised in every city and thou shalt find the people fearful and dismayed by virtue of the awful ascendancy of God's Revelation. Thus hath it been irrevocably ordained in His Holy Scriptures. 

 And also He declares: Soon will the cry 'yea, yea, here am I, here am I' be heard from every land. For there hath never been, nor can there ever be any other refuge to fly o for anyone. And again He says: The day is fast approaching when God will have manifested from this horizon such light and power as will cause the sun to be darkened, will obliterate every trace of them that have turned away disdainfully from God, and will illumine the faces of the sincere. 

 And likewise He has revealed: Ere long ye shall witness all men believing in His Cause and weeping sore over the good things that have escaped them during His days. Verily He is the Expounder, the All-Knowing. 

 And He also states: Soon will the unbelievers behold the banners of victory and will hear the name of God proclaimed from every direction, On that day will they say: 'Truly we do believe in God' Say! God well knoweth what is hidden in the breasts of all men. And again Tie has written: Ere long will the faithful behold the standards of divine manifestation unfurled in all regions. And likewise He declares: I swear by the Most Great Book that God's Revelation shall gain ascendancy and encompass the whole world. 

 Moreover, the following resplendent words which have flowed from the Pen of the Centre of the Covenant amply confirm that which the All-Glorious 

Pen of Baha'u'llah       

 has revealed: Despair not of the manifestations of the divine Spirit. 

 Ere long, by the leave of God, the veil will be removed from the face of His Cause, this effulgent light will shed its radiance upon all countries, the signs of His oneness will be spread abroad, and the banners bearing the emblems of your glorious Lord will float above die lofly mansion. And again He affirms: The day will soon come when the light of Divine unity will have so permeated the East and the West that no man dare any longer ignore it.

  LET these exalted words be thy love-song on the tree of Baha, 0 thou most holy and resplendent 

Leaf: 'God, besides Whom   

 is none other God, the Lord of this world and the next!' Verily, We have elevated thee to the rank of one of the most distinguished among thy sex, and granted thee, in My court, a station such as none other woman hath surpassed.  Thus have We preferred thee and raised thee above the rest, as a sign of grace from Him Who is the Lord of the throne on high and earth below. 

 We have created thine eyes to behold the light of My countenance, thine ears to hearken unto the melody of My words, thy body to pay homage before My throne. Do thou render thanks unto God, thy Lord, the Lord of all the world. 

 How high is the testimony of the Sadratu'1-Muntah~ for its leaf; how exalted the witness of the Tree of Life unto its fruit! 

 Through My remembrance of her a fragrance laden with the perfume of musk liath been diffused; well

 Be astir upon God's Tree in conformity with thy pleasure and unloose thy tongue in praise of thy Lord amidst all mankind. 

 Let not the things of the world grieve thee. 

 Cling fast unto this divine Lote-Tree  from which God hath graciously caused thee to spring forth. I swear by My life! It behoveth the lover to be closely joined to the loved one, and here indeed is the Best-Beloved of the world.

         ABOUT THE GREATEST HOLY LEAF AND
         A SELECTION OF HIS LETTERS TO HER

  To MY honoured and distinguished sister do thou convey the expression of my heartfelt, my intense longing. Day and night she liveth in my remembrance. 

 I dare make no mention of the feelings which separation from her hath aroused in mine heart; for whatever I should attempt to express in writing will assuredly be effaced by the tears which such sentiments must bring to mine eyes 0     DfYA!1 It is incumbent upon thee, throughout the journey, to be a close, a constant  and cheerful companion to my honoured and distinguished sister. Unceasingly, with the utmost vigour and devotion, exert thyself, by day and night, to gladden her blessed heart; for all her days she was denied a moment of tranquillity. 

 She was astir and restless every hour of her life. 

 Moth-like she circled in adoration round the undying flame of the Divine Candle, her spirit ablaze and her heart consumed by the fire of His Jove 

           LII                        

  0    MY well-beloved, deeply spiritual sister! Day and night thou livest in my memory. Whenever I remember thee my heart swelleth with sadness and my regret groweth more intense. Grieve not, for I am thy true, thy unfailing comforter. Let neither despondency nor despair becloud the serenity of thy life or restrain thy freedom. These days shall pass away. We will, please God, in the Abh6 Kingdom and beneath the sheltering shadow of the Blessed Beauty, forget all these our earthly cares and will find each one of these base calumnies amply compensated by His expressions of praise and favour. 

 From the beginning of time sorrow and anxiety, regret and tribulation, have always been the lot of every loyal servant of God. Ponder this in thine heart and consider how very true Daughter of 'Abdu'l-Baha it is. Wherefore, set thine heart on the tender mercies of the Ancient Beauty and be thou filled with abiding joy and intense gladness 0 MY dear sister! 

 Praise be to God, within the sheltering grace of the Blessed Beauty, here in the lands of the West a breeze hath blown from over the rosegardens of His bestowals, and the hearts of many people have been drawn as by a magnet to the AbM Realm. 

 Whatever hath come to pass is from the confirmations of the Beloved; for otherwise, what merit had we, or what capacity? We are as a helpless babe, but fed at the breast of heavenly grace. We are no more than weak plants, but we flourish in the spring rain of His bestowals. 

 Wherefore, as a thank-offering for these bounties, on a certain day don thy garb to visit the Shrine, the ka'bjh of our heart's desire, turn thyself toward Him on my behalf, lay down thy head on that sacred Threshold, and say: 0 divine Providence! 0 

Thou forgiving Lord! Sinner

 though I be, I have no refuge save Thyself. All praise be Thine, that in my wanderings over mountains and plains, my toils and troubles on-the  seas, Thou hast answered still my cries for help, and confirmed  me, and favoured me, and honoured me with service at Thy Threshold. 

 To a feeble ant, Thou hast given Solomon's might. 

 Thou hast made of a gnat a lion in the thicket of Thy Mercy. Thou hast bestowed on a drop the swelling waves of the sea, Thou hast carried up a mote to the pinnacles of grace. 

 Whatever was achieved, was made possible through Thee. Otherwise, what strength did the fragile dust possess, what power did this feeble being have? 

 o divine Providence! Do not seize us in our sins, but give us refuge. Do not look upon our evil ways, but grant forgiveness. 
Consider not

  0     YE who burn in the flames of bereavement!  By the Daystar of the World, my bereaved and longing heart is afire with a grief that is beyond my description. The sudden, the grievous and calamitous news that the Most Exalted, the pure, the holy, the immaculate,  the brightly shining Leaf, the Remnant of Baha, and His trust, the eternal fruit and the one last remembrance of the Hoiy Tree —  may my life be offered for the wrongs she suffered — has ascended, reached me like live coals cast into a frail and afflicted heart. The foundations of my serenity were shattered, and tears of desolation came like a flood that carries all away 0     brothers and sisters in the spirit! In this solemn hour, from one direction we can hear the sounds of loud weeping, and cries of mourning and woe, rising out of the throats of the people of Bah6 throughout this nether world, because of their separation from that rich mine of faithfulness, that Orb of the heaven of eternal glory — because of her set~ ting below the horizon of this holy Spot. But from another direction can be heard the songs of praise and holy exultation from the Company  on High and the undying dwellers in Paradise, and from beyond them all God's Prophets, coming forth to welcome that fair being, and to place her in the retreats of glory, and to seat her at the right hand of Him Who is the Centre of God's Mighty Covenant. 

 The community of Baha, whether in the East of the world or the West, are lamenting like orphans left destitute; fevered, tormented, unquiet, they are voicing their grief. 

 Out of the depths of their sorrowing hearts, there rises to the Abhai Horizon this continual piercing cry: 'Where art thou gone, 0 torch of tender love? Where art thou gone, 0 source of grace and mercy? Where art thou gone, 0 symbol of bounty and generosity? 

 Where art thou gone, 0 dayspring of detachment in this world of being? 

 Where art thou gone, 0 trust left by Bail among His people, 0 remnant left by Him among His servants, 0 sweet scent of His garment, shed across all created things!' 

 0     ye who loved that luminous face! The oil within that shining lamp was used up in this world and its light was extinguished; and yet, in the lamp-niche of the Kingdom, the fingers of the Lord of the heavenly throne have kindled it so bright, and it has cast such a splendour on the maids of Heaven — dwelling in chambers of red rubies and circling about her — that they all called from out their souls and hearts, '0 joy upon joy!' and with shouts of, 'Well done! Well done! Upon thee be God's blessings, 

0 Most Exalted Leaf!'      

 did they welcome that quintessence of love and purity within the towering pavilions of eternity. 

 At that time, as bidden by the Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, did the heavenly Crier raise up his voice and cry out: '0 Most Exalted Leaf! Thou art she who did endure with patience in God's way from thine earliest childhood and throughout all thy life, and did bear in His pathway what none other hath borne, save only God in His own Self, the Supreme Ruler over all created things, and before Him, His noble Herald, and after Him, His holy Branch, the One, the Inaccessible, the Most High. The people of the Concourse on High seek the fragrance of thy presence, and the dwellers in the retreats of eternity circle about thee. To this bear witness the souls of the cherubim within the tabernacles of majesty and might, and beyond them the tongue of God the One True Lord, the Pure, the Most Wondrous. 

 Blessedness be thine and a goodly abode; glad tidings to thee and a happy ending!' 

  ...     DEARLY-BELOVED Greatest Holy Leaf! Through the mist of tears that fill my eyes I can clearly see, as I pen these lines, thy

  noble figure before me, and can recognize the serenity of thy kindly face. I can still gaze, though the shadows of the grave separate us, into thy blue, love-deep eyes, and can feel in its calm intensity, the immense love thou didst bear for the Cause of thine Almighty Father, the attachment that bound thee to the most lowly and insignificant among its followers, the warm affection thou didst cherish for me in thine heart. The memory of the ineffable beauty of thy smile shall ever continue to cheer and hearten me in the thorny path I am destined to pursue. The remembrance of the touch of thine hand shall spur me on to follow steadfastly in thy way. The sweet magic of thy voice shall remind me, when the hour of adversity is at its darkest, to hold fast to the rope thou didst seize so firmly all the days of thy life. 

 Bear thou this my message to 'Abdu'l-Baha,  thine exalted and divinely-appointed Brother: If the Cause for which Baha'u'llah toiled and laboured, for which Thou didst suffer years of agonizing sorrow, for the sake of which streams of sacred blood have flowed, should, in the days to come, encounter storms more severe than those it has already weathered,  do Thou continue to overshadow, with Thine all-encompassing care and wisdom, Thy frail, Thy unworthy appointed child. 

 Intercede, 0 noble and well-favoured scion of a heavenly Father, for me no less than for the toiling masses of thy ardent lovers, who have sworn undying allegiance to thy memory,  whose souls have been nourished by the energies of thy love, whose conduct has been moulded by the inspiring example of thy life, and whose imaginations are fired by the imperishable evidences of thy lively faith, thy unshakeable constancy, thy invincible heroism,  thy great renunciation. 

 Whatever betide us, however distressing the vicissitudes which the nascent Faith of God may yet experience, we pledge ourselves, before the mercy-seat of thy glorious Father, to hand on, unimpaired and undivided, to generations yet unborn, the glory of that tradition of which thou hast been its most brilliant exemplar. 

 In the innermost recesses of our hearts, 0 thou exalted Leaf of the AbhA Paradise, we have reared for thee a shining mansion that the hand of time can never undermine a shrine which shall frame eternally the matchless beauty of thy countenance, an altar whereon the fire of thy consuming love shall burn for ever. 
                           
           III                        
                           
    0     THOU Scion of Bah6! I

 weep over thee in the night season, as do the bereaved; and at break of day I cry out unto thee with the tongue of my heart, my limbs and members,  and again and again I repeat thy well-loved name, and I groan over the loss of thee, over thy meekness and ordeals, and how thou didst love me, over the sufferings thou didst bear, and the terrible calamities, and the wretchedness and the griefs, and the abasement, and the rejection — and all this only and solely for the sake of thy Lord and because of thy burning love for those, out of all of creation, who shared in thine ardour. 

 Whensoever, in sleep, I call to mind and see thy smiling face, whenso~ver, by day or night, I circumambulate thine honoured tomb, then in the innermost depths of my being are rekindled the fires of yearning, and the cord of my patience is severed, and again the tears come and all the world grows dark before my eyes. And whensoever I remember what blows were rained upon thee at the close of thy days, the discomforts, trials and illnesses — and I picture thy surroundings now, in the Sanctuary on High, in the midmost heart of Heaven, beside the pavilions of grandeur and might; and I behold thy present glory, thy deliverance, the delights, the bounties, the bestowals, the majesty and dominion and power, the joy, thine exultation, and thy triumph — then the burden of my grieving is Lightened, the cloud of sorrow is dispelled, the heat of my torment abates. Then is my tongue loosed to praise and thank thee, and thy Lord, Him Who did fashion thee and did prefer thee to all other handmaidens, and did give thee to drink from His sweet-scented lips. Who withdrew  the veil of concealment from thy true being and made thee to be a true example for all thy kin to follow, and caused thee to be the fragrance of His garment for all of creation. 

 And at such times I strengthen my resolve to follow in thy footsteps, and to continue onward in the pathway of thy love; to take thee as my model, and to acquire the quali

  ties, and to make manifest that which thou didst desire for the triumph of this exalted and exacting, this most resplendent, sacred, and wondrous Cause. 

 Then intercede thou for me before the throne of the Almighty, 0 thou who, within the Company on High, dost intercede for all of humankind. 

 Deliver me from the throes of my mourning, and confer upon me and those who love thee in this nether world what will remove our afflictions, and bring assurance to our hearts, and quiet the winds of our sorrows, and console our eyes, and fulfil our hopes both in this world and the world to come — O thou whom God hast singled out from amongst all the countenances of the AbM Paradise, and hast honoured in both His earth and His Kingdom on high, and of whom He has made mention in the Crimson Book, in words which wafted the scent of musk and scattered its fragrance over all the dwellers on earth! 

    0 thou Greatest Holy Leaf! 

 If I cry at every moment out of a hundred mouths, and from each of these mouths I speak with a hundred thousand tongues, yet I could never describe nor celebrate thy heavenly qualities, which are known to none save only the Lord God; nor could I befittingly tell of even the transient foam from out the ocean of tine endless favour and grace. 

 Except for a very few, whose habitation is in the highest retreats of holiness, and who circle, in the furthermost Sanctuary, by day and by night about the throne of God, and are fed at the hand of the AbliA Beauty on purest milk — except for these, no soul of this nether world has known or recognized thine immaculate,  thy most sacred essence, nor has any befittingly perceived that ambergris fragrance of thy noble qualities, which richly anoints thy brow, and which issues from the divine wellspring of mystic musk; nor has any caught its sweetness. 

 To this bear witness the Company on High, and beyond them God Himself, the 

Supreme                    

 Lord of all the heavens and the earths: that during all thy days, from thine earliest years until the close of thy life, thou didst personify the attributes of thy Father, the MateMess, the Mighty. Thou wert the fruit of His Tree, thou wert the lamp of His love, thou wert the symbol of His serenity, and of His meekness, the pathway of His guidance, the chann&1 of His blessings, the sweet scent of His robe, the refuge of His loved ones and His handmaidens, the mantle of His generosity and grace. 

 0 thou Remnant of the divine light, 0 thou fruit of the Cause of our All-Compelling Lord! 

 From the hour when thy days did set, on the horizon of this Snow-White, this unique and Sacred Spot, our days have turned to night, our joys to great consternation; our eyes have grown blind with sorrow at thy passing, for it has brought back that supreme affliction yet again, that direst convulsion, the departing of thy compassionate 

Brother, our Merciful      

 Master. And there is no refuge for us anywhere except for the breathings of thy spirit, the spotless, the excellently bright; no shelter for us anywhere, but through thine intercession, that God may inspire us with His own patience, and ordain for us in the other life the reward of meeting thee again, of attaining thy presence, of gazing on thy countenance, and partaking of thy light. 

 O thou Maid of Baha! The best and choicest of praises, and the most excellent and most glorious of salutations, rest upon thee, 0 thou solace of mine eyes, and beloved of my soul! Thy grace to me was plenteous, it can never be concealed; thy love for me was great, it can never be forgotten. 

 Blessed, a thousand times blessed, is he who loves thee, and partakes of thy splendours, and sings the praises of thy qualities, and extols thy worth, and follows in thy footsteps; who testifies to the wrong~ thou didst suffer, and visits thy resting-place, and circles around thine exalted tomb, by day and by night

          4. A SELECTION OF LETTERS OF THE
                 GREATEST HOLY LEAF

  FROM this hallowed and snow-white Spot, this blessed, heavenly Garden, wherefrom the fragrance of God is diffused to all regions, I hail you with salutations, most tender, most wondrous, and most glorious, and impart to you the most joyful tiding. This tiding serves as the sweet-smelling savour of His raiment to them that long to behold His face, it represents the highest aspiration of His steadfast  leaves, it is the animating impulse for the happiness of the world, it is the source of ineffable gladness to the people of Bah6, a remedy to the afflicted, and a refreshing draught for the thirsty. By the righteousness of God, 0 beloved friend, through this glad-tiding  the ailing are cured and every mouldering  bone is quickened. This most joyful tiding is the news of the good health and wellbeing of the blessed, the exalted, the holy person of 'Abdu'l-Baha, 'He Whom God hath purposed'  — may the life of all created things be offered up for His oneness. 
                           
THE Festival of Ridvan     

 is come and the splendour of the light of God is shining from the invisible horizon of His mercy. 

 The overflowing grace of the Lord of oneness is pouring down copiously from the unseen world and the glad-tidings of the Kingdom are coming in from all countries. 

 The resplendent morn that betokens the advancement of the Cause of God and heralds the exaltation of His Word is dawning in every region. 

 Praise be to God that the fame of the Ancient Beauty — may my life be offered up for His loved ones — has been noised abroad in the world and the glory of His Cause is spread far and wide throughout the East and the West. These joyous developments will indeed gladden the hearts of His loved ones. 
                           
           III                        

  THE passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, may our lives be a sacrifice for His meekness, was the ultimate calamity, the most great disaster. 

 The light has fled our hearts, and our souls are wedded to sorrow, and no power in all the world can furnish any consolation, save• only the power that comes from the steadfastness of the believers and their deep-rooted faith, and their unity, and their love for one another. 

 Oniy these can lessen the pain and quiet the anguish Although to outward seeming the Sun of the Covenant has hidden Himself behind the clouds, and the Orb of the Testament is concealed, and on the holy horizon of glory, He has now set, and is lost to view — still His rays are shining from out His hidden place, and forever will His light shed down its splendours. 

 For ever and ever will He, with all that invisible grace, and those bestowals of the spirit, lead the seeker onward, and guide the yearning, and ravish the hearts of the lovers. 

  A. PHYSICIAN treats every illness with a certain remedy and to every painful sore he applies a specially prepared compound. The more severe the illness, the more potent must be the remedy, so that the treatment may prove effective and the illness cured. Now consider, when the divine Physician1 determined  to conceal His countenance from the gaze of men and take His flight to the AbhA Kingdom, He knew in advance what a violent shock, what a tremendous impact, the effect of this devastating blow would have upon His beloved friends and devoted lovers. Therefore He prepared a highly potent remedy and compounded a unique and incomparable cure — a cure most exquisite, most glorious, most excellent, most powerful, most perfect, and most consummate. And through the movement of His Pen of eternal bounty He recorded in His weighty and involable Testament the name of Shoghi Effendi — the bough that has grown from the two offshoots of the celestial glory, the branch that has branched from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees. 
                           
Abdu'l-Baha.


<p48>
48                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Then He winged His flight to the Concourse on High and to the luminous horizon. 

 Now it devolves upon every well-assured and devoted friend, every firm and enkindled believer enraptured by His love, to drink this healing remedy at one draught, so that the agony of bereavement may be somewhat alleviated and the bitter anguish of separation dissipated. This calls for efforts to serve the Cause, to diffuse the sweet savours of God, to manifest selflessness, consecration and self-sacrifice in our labours in His 

Path.                      

  THE Ancient Beauty, the Most Great Name, has, through the splendours of His grace in this most glorious of all ages, made this world of dust to radiate light. The loving counsels of 'Abdu'l-Baha have turned the beloved of the Lord into signs and tokens of humility and lowliness. He has taught them selflessness, and freedom from material things, and detachment from the world, and has enabled them to understand the verities of Heaven. 

 In that supernal realm we are all but motes; in the court of the Lord God's majesty we are but helpless shadows. He is the Shelter for all; He is the Protector of all; He is the Helper of all; He is the Preserver of all. Whensoever we look upon ourselves, we, one and all, despair; but He, with all His grace, His bestowals, His bounties, is the close Companion of each one. 

 It is certain that tests and trials are inseparable from this life and a vital requirement thereof, especially for the human race and above all for those who claim to have faith and love. Only through trials can the genuine be known from the worthless, and purity from pollution, and the real from the false. The meaning of the sacred verse: 'Do men think when they say "We believe" they shall be let alone and not be put to proof?'1 prevails at all times and is applicable at every breath, and fire will only bring out the brightness of the gold. 

 So it is my hope that with lowliness and a contrite heart, with supplications and prayers, with good intentions and faithfulness, with purity of heart and adherence to the truth, 

Q~If~J1 29:2.              

 with rising up to serve and with the blessings and confirmations of the Lord, we may come into a realm, and arrive at a condition, where we shall live under His overshadowing mercy, and His helping hand shall come to our aid and succour. 

  THE Pen of the divine Ordainer has so decreed that this house of sorrows should be encompassed by unending calamity and pain. Even before the dark clouds of one disaster are scattered, the lowering storm of yet a new grief takes over, casting its darkness across the inner skies of the heart. Such has been the lot of this brokenhearted one and the other leaves of the Holy Tree, from earliest child-hocid  until this hour; such has been the fruit we have plucked from the tree of our lives. 

 We can see before us the Holy Shrine where lies the blessed, riddled body of the Primal Point, and memory of the delicate and tender  remains of other martyrs passes before our eyes. The remembrance of the Ancient Beauty's dungeon in Tihr~n, and that most noble Being's exile from city to city, culminating  in the murk of the 'AkM prison, is engraved upon our minds. The calamities, the massive afflictions, endured by 'Abdu'l-Baha throughout His entire life, and Hi wailing at the break of dawn are recorded for all time upon the tablets of the soul, and those cries that rose out of His luminous heart will linger on in the mind's ear. 

 It is clear, too, how the most dire of all ordeals, the ascension of the divine Beauty, made the structure of our existence to topple down; how being deprived of Him consfimed the very limbs of our bodies. 

 And when our fiery tears brought on by this were not yet dried, and the heart's wound had not healed over, then the bearer of God's decree called us to yet another anguish, that dire calamity, that terrible disaster, the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Then were we, the sorrow-stricken, thrust again into the fires of separation, and the pitch darkness of deep mourning enshrouded this family. 
     Beloved friends of the     

Blessed Beauty:            

 what could have been the purpose of those holy Beings in enduring such agonies? Why did those precious and luminous souls accept

  all that hardship and pain? Any just observer will acknowledge that They had no other end in view but to better the human race and cleanse it from the imperfections of this contingent world, and see to its advancement, and endow all peoples with the wondrous virtues of humankind. Thanks be to God's bounties, the signs of such perfections, the lights of such bestowals, have become clearly manifest throughout the world. 

 The tree of His Cause grows ever more massive, day by day, and heavier with fruit, and from moment to moment taller, and it shall cast its wondrous  shade over all who seek its shelter

With Thy generous hand, lay Thou a balm upon our sores, grant us a medicine for this never-healing woe. Console Thou Thy loved ones, comfort Thy friends and handmaids, heal Thou our wounded breasts, and with Thy bounty's remedy, restore our festering hearts. 

 With the gentle breeze of Thy compassion, make fresh and green again these boughs, withered by autumn blasts; restore Thou to flourishing life these flowers, shrivelled by the blight of bereavement. 

 With tidings of the AbhA Paradise, wed Thou our souls to joy, and rejoice Thou our spirits with heartening voices from the dwellers  in the realm of glory.

50                 THE BAHA'! WORLD
 5. A TRIBUTE TO THE GREATEST HOLY LEAF
               Abdu'l-Baha R6hfyyih KhThum

  'THE outstanding heroine of the Baha'i Dispensation.' 

 Thus does the Guardian characterize  his illustrious great-aunt, the peerless daughter of Baha'u'llah, the faithful and beloved  sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

   The Greatest Holy Leaf     

 was the eldest daughter of Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith. Born in Persia in 1846 she, in her long life which ended in 1932, spanned, with the exception of two years, the entire Heroic Age of this new world religion. At the age of six when her Father was cast into the subterranean dungeon in TihrTh known as the 'Black Hole', her home was immediately looted and despoiled. In a day the wealthy and noble family was beggared and hid in fear of their lives as Baha'u'llah lay in heavy chains — the most prominent, the most blameless  victim of the turmoil which His Forerunner's  liberal teachings had provoked in a land of bitter Muslim Shf'ah fanaticism. Nay-vTh, the refined, frail, saintly mother of the little girl, fled to a humble dwelling near the dungeon where she could be near her illustrious  and much-loved Spouse; 'Abdu'l-Baha, her eight-year-old Brother, accompanied His mother when daily she went to the home of friends to ascertain whether Baha'u'llah was still alive or had been executed that day — for every day some of His coreligionists were martyred, often being handed over to va±ious guilds, the butchers, the bakers, the shoemakers,  the blacksmiths, who exercised their ingenuity on new ways of torturing them to death. Through long days of constant terror the little girl stayed at home with her four-year-old  brother Mihdf; often, she recalled, she could hear the shrieks of the mob as they carried off their victims. After four months Baha'u'llah was released through the intervention  of various prominent people, and He and His family were exiled to 'IrAq. In a very severe winter, through the snowbound mountains of western Persia, the ill-clad, destitute party for three months suffered the ordeal of what He described as that terrible journey. Navv6b sold the gold buttons of her clothes to help buy food and washed their garments till her delicate hands bled. 

 Such were the earliest recollections of Baha'i Kh6num; the happy, secure days of her first six years must have become a dreamlike experience, for no real peace ever entered her life again. Her Brother 'Abdu'l-Baha testified to this: For all her days she was denied a moment of tranquillity. 

 The family had barely settled in Baghd6d when the infant Faith of Baha'u'llah was seized by a new convulsion; a year after His arrival, when the Greatest Holy Leaf was eight, He withdrew for two years to the mountains of Su1aym~niyyih, living as a dervish,  His whereabouts unknown to His family and admirers alike. This sacrifice, however, did not avert calamity; the internal and external enemies of His Faith had relentlessly pursued their ends, and in May 1863, just after Baha'u'llah had revealed His own station  to some of His followers, for the second time Baha'i KhAnum became an exile and travelled with her mother and other women in covered  carts for almost four months from Baghdad to Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, in the caravan of her Father, which comprised about seventy of His followers. 

 By now the young girl had turned her back on the world — a decision which is ever an inward orientation — and was wholly dedicated, every moment of her life, to serving  her Divine 

Father, her Brother 'Abdu'l-Baha 

 Whom she adored, her frail, heroic and beloved mother, her younger brother Mihdf who had rejoined them, and all the followers of Baha'u'llah — indeed, all and sundry who ever crossed her path! 

 Yet a third banishment lay ahead of the Greatest Holy Leaf; with no warning or justification, four months after their arrival, in the depths of a very bitter winter, the SultAn once again exiled Baha'u'llah, His family and companions, this time to the city of his displeasure, Adrianople. 

 At the beginning of December, for twelve days, over the windswept  plains of western Turkey, in storms of snow and rain, in carts and on pack animals, the party struggled, Baha'u'llah Himself testifying that: Neither My family, nor those who


<p51>
THE COMMEMORATION OF HISTORIC ANNIVERSARIES                                    51

  accompanied Me, had the necessary raiment to protect them from the cold in that freezing weather. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who rode beside His Father's conveyance, was again badly frostbitten, as He had already been on the long journey from Tihr~n to Baghd6d, and suffered  its effects till the end of His life. On their arrival, ill, destitute, prisoners, they were assigned to crowded, cold, vermin-infested houses — for Baha'i Kh6num the most repugnant of all her sufferings. So terrible was their plight during this period that Baha'u'llah asserts: The eyes of Our enemies wept over Us, and beyond them those of every discerning person. 

 During the four years and eight months they sojourned in Adrianople fresh horrors attended the exiled family. In spite of Baha'u'llah's every effort to redeem 

His half-brother, Mirza    

 Yahy~, his intense jealousy reached its apex and he poisoned Baha'u'llah, Whose life hung in the balance for a month, and Who carried the mark of this treachery in a trembling  hand until the end of His life. 

  The Greatest Holy Leaf     

 often stated that all the years of her life, from childhood to maturity, were overshadowed by the constant threat that she might be separated from her beloved Father; it was a very real threat for on a number of occasions there was a plan to divide the exiles, Baha'u'llah to be sent to some unknown destination and His family to another. Once again the machinations of His enemies, within and without, ripened into a plan of this nature. 

 The same Su1t~n who had exiled Him from Baghd6d to Constantinople, and from Constantinople to Adrianople, now issued another edict of exile which was to carry Him to the prison-city of 'Akka in Syria for the last twenty-four years of His life — but His frantic family did not know this, they only knew another exile, and probably permanent separation, now lay ahead. 

 After a miserable, crowded voyage of ten days, with little food, through rough seas, in August heat, the band of exiles — still all together due to the masterful intervention of 'Abdu'l-Baha — were finally locked into the barracks of the prison-city of 'Akka Illness, death, privation were their lot for two years, the worst blow of all being the death of the gentle, universally loved Mihdf who, while walking on the prison roof and meditating, fell through an opening and died of his injuries. His body was washed in the presence of his Father Whose poignant grief has been recorded by Him; what went on in the hearts of the tender mother, the loving sister, we can only imagine. 

 Slowly the wheels of destiny revolved. Through the unceasing efforts of 

'Abdu'l-Baha,  Baha'u'llah

 was able, although still a prisoner, to live the last years of His life in relative peace in a beautiful mansion in the countryside outside 'Akka. Baha'i KM-num, however, continued to live in 'Akka with 'Abdu'l-Baha and His family, whose imprisonment was not permanently lifted until the fall of the SultAnate in 1908 freed all political prisoners. 

 The sun of the glory of her Father set in 1892, an event which again led to violent upheavals caused by internal and external enemies of the Faith; but the selfless devotion, the consecration to service in whatever  form was needed, which had been manifested  in Baha'i KMnum's life since she was six years old, continued unchanged; her whole being now revolved about the Brother she adored, the 

Centre of His Father's     

 Covenant, the Head of His Faith. During the years of ever-increasing freedom and victory 'Abdu'l-Baha embarked upon His history-making visits to Egypt, Europe and North America. Some of His letters to the Greatest Holy Leaf reflect not only His constant love and thoughts of her but His joy over the triumphant nature of His tour. But once again, inevitably it seems in her sorrow-filled life, great afflictions came upon her. In November 1921 this Brother — so adored, so close a companion since their earliest childhood — closed His eyes and passed away from a world that had so honoured Him, so afflicted Him for almost four score years. 

 The death of the partner in her trials, her exiles, her family's upheavals and crises, would have been sufficient for any woman of her age; added to it now came the condition of 'Abdu'l-Baha's successor, His eldest grandson, appointed Guardian of His Faith, a young man of twenty-four, devastated with grief because 'Abdu'l-Baha had died during his absence at Oxford University, and completely  overwhelmed and prostrated by the news of the station and responsibilities conferred  upon him in his Grandfather's Will and

Testament. As always Baha'i

 Kh6num rose to the occasion, comforted, supported, nursed and encouraged the heartbroken youth, the youth of whom, when he was a child, 'Abdu'l-Baha had written to her: Kiss the fresh flower of the garden of sweetness, Shoghi Effendi. More than this, she accepted the headship of the Faith which Shoghi Effendi, in his great distress, conferred upon her when he withdrew,  as he wrote, until such time as having gained health, strength, self-confidence and spiritual energy' he would be able to take into his hands 'entirely and regularly the work of service .' Upon Baha'i KlAnum's frail shoulders yet again God placed a heavy load. Though she was now seventy-five, she bore, with her usual nobility, dignity, self-effacement and great inner assurance and strength, all the terrible events related to and produced by the ascension of her Brother. 

 At last came the great freeing, her turn to shake the dust of this earth from her feet and wing away to realms on high. But the release and reward for her was far different for him whom she left behind; 'to one who was reared by the hands of her loving kindness', Shoghi Effendi wrote, 'the burden of this direst of calamities is well-nigh unbearable'. 

 Torrents of passionate feeling poured from his pen, in English to the Baha'is of the West, in Persian and Arabic to the Baha of the East. All his love and, above all, her glory, became embodied in immortal words. During the thirty-six years of the Guardian's ministry he never ceased to remember her, to associate her with the unfoldment  of the Faith throughout the world, the rise of its institutions at the World Centre; the largest or smallest of his own undertakings; whether publicly or quietly in his personal life, her memory and influence were always there. He summed up what she represented historically,  and to him personally in his dedication to her of The Dawn Breakers — the masterpiece he created out of Nabfl's Narrative through his unique translation: 

            To                        
  The Greatest Holy Leaf    

 The Last Survivor of a Glorious and 

        Heroic Age                
   I Dedicate This Work      
in Token of a             

Great Debt of Gratitude   

 and Love Some relics of the Greatest Holy Leaf preserved in the International Baha'i Archives.

   6. THE COMMEMORATION AT THE WORLD CENTRE OF THE
        FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSING OF
                THE GREATEST HOLY LEAF

  As midnight of 14 July 1982 approached, the Baha'is of the World Centre were gathered in the forecourt of the pilgrim house. 

 With the arrival of Abdu'l-Baha R4ifyyih KlThnum, the assembled friends silently followed her into the brightly illuminated Shrine of the Bab which cast a swathe of golden light against the dark mountain. It was the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf and, in union with Baha'is around the globe, the World Centre paid its tribute to the most remarkable woman of the Baha'i Dispensation. 

 Ai the Shrine the friends heard the recitation  of the Tablet of Visitation at the tomb of the BTh, followed by the chanting of the Tablet of Visitation in the Shrine of 'Abdu'l-Baha They then quietly, reverently filed out of the Shrine, and proceeded up to the main gate where police were temporarily holding traffic, silently crossed the road and wound their way through the Monument Gardens to the light-drenched tomb of the Greatest Holy Leaf whose graceful, nine-columned monument  had been decorated beautifully with flowers. 

 The night air rang with the Arabic words of Baha'u'llah's tribute to His daughter: This is My testimony for her who hath heard My voice and drawn nigh unto Me. 

 Verily, she is a leaf that hath sprung from this preexistent Root The passage was read in English. Deep emotion stirred the hearts of the friends who were keenly aware of the privilege that was theirs in being in such a spot, at such a time, and hearing in surroundings of ineffable beauty and peace, these words: Let these exalted words be thy love-song on the tree of Baha, 0 thou most holy and resplendent leaf The hushed crowd stood for a long moment of reflection, loath to leave the peaceful spot. 

  The first gathering ever held in the Permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice on Mount Carmel was a seminar on the life of the Greatest Holy Leaf, held on 17 

July 1982.                 

 Though not entirely ready for occupancy, the Seat was the venue for a memorable programme  which, together with the midnight commemoration at the tomb, constituted the World Centre's observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of Baha'i 

Khdnum.                    

 At nine am. the Hands of the Cause, members of the Universal House of Justice and Counsellor members of the International Teaching Centre, together with their families and the World Centre staff, gathered in the reception concourse whose beauty surprised even those who had seen it emerging over several years. 

 The aesthetic perfection of the surroundings brought peace and assurance to the participants' spirits, belying the troubled world outside. The chairman paid tribute to the dedicated work of the many friends whose efforts had led to that thrilling moment. 

 He spoke of the international crew of volunteer workers from Canada, Ecuador, England, Germany, frTh, Mauritius, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States who had put in extra-long hours to ensure the readiness of those portions of the building which were used for the anniversary observance. 

 The broad stairway, seven metres wide, leading down into the concourse from the second floor, served as dais. The friends were seated to the left of the main entrance, while behind them lay an area of comparable size which will permit the seating of more than twice the two hundred and fifty people who were in attendance. 

 Numerous arrangements of roses and other flowers accented the structural beauty of the reception concourse whose design reflects classic perfection of proportion. 

 The warm July air of Haifa drifted gently in through the, large windows which stood open to receive the breeze. A Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed to the Greatest Holy Leaf was first chanted then repeated in English. 

 The first to deliver her talk that day was one who had close personal association with Baha'i Khlium, the Hand of the Cause 

Abdu'l-Baha  Rhhfyyih     

 Kfrmnum. She began her re

 marks, however, by calling to mind 'one whose chair is empty today'. The friends' thoughts turned to Mr. Amoz Gibson, the well-loved member of the Universal House of Justice, whose death they had so recently mourned. 

 She then spoke for more than an hour sharing her memories of 'Kh4num' as the Greatest Holy Leaf was known. She told of the privilege she was given as a young girl of sharing intimate moments with Khdnum in the Master's House during her stay in Haifa with her mother, May Maxwell, in 1923. 

     Counsellor Anneliese Bopp  

 presented a summary of the life of 'the outstanding heroine of the Baha'i Dispensation'. 

 She enumerated some of the titles by which Baha'u'llah Kh4num is called in the literature of. the Faith, among which are: 'well-beloved sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha'; the Holy Family's 'most precious, most great adorning'; 'the brightly shining Leaf, the Remnant of Bah6, and His trust, the eternal fruit and the one last remembrance of the Holy Tree'. 

 In the afternoon, Mr. 'Ali Na~j~jav~nf shared precious memories from the life of the Greatest 

Holy Leaf. He noted That   

 the dome of the Seat is reminiscent of the dome of the monument of the Greatest Holy Leaf, saying that the architect intended this visible link between the two structures. The emotions that stirred in each privileged participant through the recitals of treasured memories can only be guessed at, but showed clearly on the participants' faces. 

 Mrs. Baha'u'llah Ma'Anf gave an original presentation on the Greatest Holy Leafs place in religious history, outlining first the role of each of the outstanding women of previous Dispensations, and reinforcing the friends' respect for the capacities and services of the Greatest Holy Leaf and for the effective contributions she made at several times in the history of the 

Cause.                     

 During a break for refreshments the friends went out by the back door of the Concourse and enjoyed the shade bf the colonnade while admiring the dramatic display of colour that had in recent months appeared in the terraced gardens. 

 The five-tiered garden rises steeply for twenty-five metres and is profusely planted with a variety of flowers, blossoming shrubs and small trees. 

     Portraits of Baha'i      

 Khdnum and scenes associated with her life were shown in a slide presentation prepared by Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Thompson. This was followed by recitation in Persian and English of a prayer from the pen of the Greatest Holy Leaf which provided a fitting conclusion to a day spent commemorating  her saintly life.

 8. SOME WORKS PUBLISHED TO COMMEMORATE THE FIFTIETH
    ANNIVERSARY OF TI-TB PASSING OF THE GREATEST
                      HOLY LEAF

  IN its message to 'the Baha'is of the world', Nawruz 

1981, the Universal House 

 of Justice  announced its intention to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf by issuing 'a compilation of letters to her and of statements about her by Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, and the beloved Guardian, and of her own letters'. The successful achievement of this objective was announced to all National 

Spiritual Assemblies     
on 12 April 1982.         

 'The fiftieth anniversary of the ascension of Baha'i Kitnum, eldest daughter of Baha'u'llah  and designated by Him the Greatest Holy Leaf, will occur on July 15th of this year,' the House of Justice advised all 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 on 24 January 1982. 'We summon the entire Baha'i world to a befitting commemoration  of the life of the greatest woman in the Baha'i Dispensation. 

'National Spiritual Assemblies

 are requested  to arrange national commemorative services,  and to ensure that all local communities hold befitting meetings. These services should be held on the date of the anniversary or on the weekend immediately following it, and in those countries where Mashriqu'l-Adhkar's are in existence, they should be held in the Temple.' 

 Enclosed with the letter was a bibliography of references to the Greatest Holy Leaf in Baha'i literature in English to assist national communities in arrangements for the services.1 

 Many and varied were the programmes held throughout the Baha'i world, each characterized  by dignity and devotion. In addition, numerous teaching proj ects were inaugurated in her memory and conferences and deepening classes were held at which her heroic life was studied.

THE COMMEMORATION OF HISTORIC ANNIVERSARIES                                    59

     9. THE GREATEST HOLY LEAF: A REMINISCENCE1

                   'All Na~Jjav6ni

  As we sit together in this gathering lam reminded of the fact that our beloved Guardian,  Shoghi Effendi, speaks about the mystic bond that exists between the Greatest 

Holy Leaf and Baha'u'llah.  

 Obviously this is so, for she was not only His daughter but was referred to by Him as the woman who has the highest rank among all women believers in the Baha dispensation, a station that none surpasses. 

 Shoghi Effendi, basing himself on this statement, has named her the outstanding heroine of the Baha dispensation. 

   The Greatest Holy Leaf     

 also had a mystic bond, as Shoghi Effendi describes the relationship,  with her brother, 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Centre of the Covenant — One Who not only knew her station and appointed her to be in total charge of His household, but Who entrusted her with the sacred remain~ of the Bab which were housed in her room for some ten years in the house of 'Abdu'llAh P~sh6 Who entrusted her with His last will and testament and Who realized that after His passing she would play a central role in the community, as He knew that Shoghi Effendi was not present at the time of His passing. 

 We can be sure that 'Abdu'l-Baha passed away with His mind at rest, because He knew that Shoghi Effendi would soon be there, and that the Greatest Holy Leaf was there. 

 After the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha the mystic bond between Shoghi Effendi and the Greatest Holy Leaf assumed far-reaching proportions. 

 I am sure that future historians and other writers will write about the eleven years that passed from the night of the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha to the night of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf. 

 The thought was borne in today, as I gazed at the friends assembled in this meeting in this majestic setting, that the House of Justice is beginning to forge its links and bonds with the 1 Excerpts from an address presented during the World Centre seminar commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf, held in the reception concourse, permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice, 17 July 1982. 

Greatest Holy Leaf. Why?   

 Following so close upon the fiftieth anniversary of her passing the very first meeting in the permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice is held in her name. The architect of this building, Mr. Husayn Am~nat, today confirmed my recollection  that he had deliberately designed the dome of this building to be reminiscent of the dome on the monument erected at the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf. If we compare these two domes we will see the resemblance in broad outline. He did so, he said, because of the wellknown statement of Shoghi Effendi in which he likened the administrative order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah  to the monument of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the dome representing the Universal House of 

Justice.                   

 This building, itself, standing so close to her resting-place, caused me to reflect, as I stood outside, upon yet another symbolism. 

 It is as though someone were standing with his arms outstretched in a semicircle, this arc, the world administrative seat of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, encircling the consecrated spot where these three precious souls are buried, the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Purest Branch and Navv6b — chief among them the Greatest Holy Leaf. Thus we are now witnessing the forging of bonds at the World Centre of the Faith between the Universal House of Justice and the Greatest 

Holy Leaf.                 

 It is somewhat embarrassing to find myself speaking of my own recollections of the Greatest Holy Leaf. 

 I came to the Holy Land in 1922 when I was two-and-a-half years old. The Greatest Holy Leaf passed away in 1932. Of course, I have no memories left of the first two or three years because I was too young, but a few memories have remained of the later years of that decade. 

 I will, then, speak about this young child who has memories of being in the presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf. This child had a brother who was very close to him — my brother Jal6l who passed away in May of this year — and the experiences which I relate were joint experiences. 
I am grateful to

  Baha'u'llah for having occasion to mention my brother's name here today. 

 The young child of whom I speak was born of a mother, I'kitimib KhAnum, who had spent her youthful life in service to the Greatest Holy Leaf, serving for some fifteen years, dating back to the time when the Master was in the house of 'Abdu'11Th P6sh6 in 'Akka Some of you may have met her sister, my aunt, Zeenat Baghdadi, who came to the Holy Land not long ago to give information relating to the restoration of the house of 'Abdu'116h P6shi These two sisters, when they were young girls in 'Akka, nine and eleven years old, were accepted into the household of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 My mother was chosen to serve the Greatest Holy Leaf for all those years. So in our family home we had many stories and feelings — the feelings more important than the stories — about the Greatest Holy Leaf, and the way my mother felt about her. These things are in my background and are for you to visualize as I speak to you. 

 Speaking about this bond between Shoghi Effendi and the Greatest I-Ioiy Leaf, Zeenat, my aunt, used to say that in the house of 'Abdu'llah PAshA there used to be a parrot. The Greatest Holy Leaf used to take a mirror hold it before the bird and bid it to say 'Ya lidhi va Mahba bE!' (0 my God and my Beloved!) and to say 'Shoghi ]dn!' (Shoghi dear!) 

 Early in the morning, at dawn, my aunt recalled, the household could hear the parrot crying 'Ya lidhi va Mahbabi!. Shoghiffin!' We have my aunt's voice on tape and I have tried to imitate that 'Shoghi jdn!' with its high pitch. 

 During the period of the commission of investigation in the time of 'Abdu'1-Hamid, when grave problems confronted 'Abdu'l-Baha,  it was necessary for the Master to conceal His Will and Testament. Although I have no evidence to support my belief, I am convinced that the only soul apart from 'Abdu'l-Baha who knew at that time who would be the Master's successor was the Greatest Holy Leaf. She was the depository of His secrets, so to speak. 

 When you visit the house of 'Abdu'llAh PAsh~ you will be shown the room of the 

Greatest Holy Leaf. My     

 aunt said that she had often wondered why it was that the Greatest Holy Leaf would sit on the mandar in that room, in utter silence, for hours on end. My aunt described my mother sitting at the feet of the Greatest Holy Leaf, also remaining silent and motionless, hour after hour. She said it was only later that she understood that it was because the remains of the Bab were in that room. 

 If we wish to visualize it — forgive my saying this but I am trying to make it understood — it is as though we were asked to live and sleep in the Shrine of the BTh. Obviously, we can well imagine that the Greatest Holy Leaf lived in reverence, turning her heart to the Mb, realizing the sacred trust she had to protect for ten years in that room. 

 Zeenat used to explain to us that there were several things clearly visible in the life of the Greatest Holy Leaf in the house of 'Abdu'116h PashA and, of course, later on these patterns were transferred to her life at the house of 'Abdu'l-Baha in Haifa. 

 One was the undisputed authority of the Greatest Holy Leaf after 'Abdu'l-Baha; that was definitely clear. It was not Munirili Kh6num indeed, far from it. It was the Greatest Holy 

Leaf.                      

 A second was her leadership in coordinating the meetings related to the Baha'i women. Whether in 'Akka or Haifa, she presided over their meetings and controlled everything. 

 The friends would come to her for names for their children, for consultation about a forthcoming marriage and requesting her blessing on the union. She would generally inform the friends about the development of the Cause and whatever 'Abdu'l-Baha had said. 

 She was the central point for the Baha'i women in the community in the 

Holy Land.                 

 A third was her contact with women of the higher social class in 'Akka and later in Haifa. Zeenat said that whenever prominent persons such as the Mufti of 'Akka, the Governor, or other high officials of the government called upon Abdu'l-Baha, He would ask the Greatest  Holy Leaf, rather than His daughters or His wife, to visit the women in their homes while He entertained the men in His home. 

 In addition to Persian, the Greatest Holy Leaf spoke fluent Turkish and Arabic. 

 A fourth aspect became increasingly clear as the Research Department made a study and review of the documents at the World Centre: the extensive correspondence conducted by the Greatest Holy Leaf from the days of Baha'u'llah until the end of her life. During


<p61>
THE COMMEMORATION OF HISTORIC ANNIVERSARIES                                    61

  the last six years of 

Baha'u'llah's Ministry     

 she was the Most Exalted Leaf after her mother, and there are letters written by her at that time. During the Ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha likewise there are letters from her, and after the passing of the Master, of course, during the difficult period when she was head of 'Abdu'l-Baha's household and head of the committee which was operating here in charge of the affairs of the Faith in the absence of Shoghi Effendi, until the period when he was able to take the reins of authority in his capable hands. 

 A fifth aspect was her domestic duties. Ella Goodall Cooper wrote a few lines which I think describe very well the busy life of the Greatest Holy Leaf in the household of the 

Master.                    

 'One day', she writes, 'we caught a glimpse of her in the kitchen, seated on a low stool, her firm, capable hands busy with a large lamb that had just been brought in from the market. Quickly dividing it, she directed which part was to be made into broth, which part served for the evening meal, which part kept possibly for the morrow, and which was to be sent to those poor or incapacitated friends who were daily supplied from 'Abdu'1-Curtis Curtis KeLsey astride a donkey,

 Baha'is table.' The relationship of the Greatest Holy Leaf to the poor is an element of her life which is sometimes forgotten. During the First World War she was the person responsible  for feeding the poor from the Master's house: she cooked for them, sent them rations or supplied rations when the poor came asking. All this was under her control. 

 An American believer, Curtis Kelsey, was present in the Holy Land at the time of the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. In the memoir of Mr. Kelsey written by Nathan Rutstein we find a description of the event: 'The Greatest Holy Leaf calmly went about comforting the grief-stricken, absorbing their pain. 

 As Curtis watched her move from person to person, stroking a shoulder, clasping a stretched-out hand, he noticed that she exhibited the kind of strength that 'Abdu'l-Baha radiated. 

 Some sensed that and clung to her. Her control, her poise, her unrestrained flow of compassion assured him that the Faith would not falter. She was, at that moment, the head of the Faith that her dear brother had led so successfully for twenty-nine years, giving His all. 

 She was a tower of strength that all would rally around for support. 

 'As he watched the Greatest Holy Leaf, her

  eyes caught his and she walked over to him. Since he was not crying, he wondered why she was coming toward him. 

 "Kelsey," she said, "will you take Fujita and Khusraw to 'Akka to tell the friends there of the Master's passing and then come right back?" 

 Here she was in the midst of this storm of sorrow, yet she was in full control, giving instructions, comforting everyone around her although she was the one who was in need of the greatest comfort. When the beloved Guardian passed away and a torrent of grief afflicted the Baha'is of the world, our beloved Arnatu'1-BalA Riihfyyih KlAnum acted in exactly the same way. 

 In response to a request of the Universal House of Justice the Hand of the Cause Abu'1-Q~sim Faizi has written a brief account of his visits to Haifa during the time when he was a student at the American University in Beirut. He relates a little story that is touching,  one we have heard from him many times. One day Shoghi Effendi asked Mr. Faizi to chant a prayer; he had a most melodious and heartwarming voice. 

 The next day Shoghi Effendi said that the Greatest Holy Leaf had heard his voice and she would like him to sing and chant for her. With a few other students, Mr. Faizi went to the Greatest Holy Leaf and chanted. The next day Shoghi Effendi inquired  whether Mr. Faizi had visited the Greatest Holy Leaf. 'Yes,' Mr. Faizi replied. 'And did you chant for her?' 'Yes,' said Mr. Faizi. Then Shoghi Effendi said that he had left his door open in order to enjoy the chanting and explained that the Greatest Holy Leaf first heard Mr. Faizi chant because she had left her door ajar on the earlier occasion. 

 Mr. Faizi in his reminiscences describes another occasion on which the Greatest Holy Leaf was very happy. 

 He writes, 'When our small group of students from Beirut was ushered into the presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf she was seated at the upper end of a large room facing the door.' 

 I think this must be the same room which served as the women's tearoom. 

 'The wife of the Master Munirili Kh6num sat next to her and other ladies of the household sat on either side in a semicircle. 

 The mother of the Guardian, Dfy6'iyyih Khfinum, stood behind the Greatest  Holy Leaf with her hands resting on the shoulders of her beloved aunt. We students were given seats facing this beautiful audience. Khdnum sat still, her lily-white hands resting gently on her lap. She was a queen who inspired love and reverence and at her throne of grandeur we offered our grateful hearts. Her glance was full of love but she did not speak to us. The Master's wife, Munfrih KhAnum, spoke on her behalf. 

 She greeted us whQn we arrived and thanked us warmly in KhAnum's name at the end of our programme of prayers, songs and Baha'i poems. 

 On yet another occasion the students were invited. 

 'This time she said she would like to hear one of the songs that labourers sing in IrAn as they go home in the evening on their way back from work. 

 She asked if there was anyone among us who knew these songs. We were surprised that Kitnum should still remember  such songs which she must have heard on the streets in TihrTh during her early childhood. 

 Perhaps the sight of a group of young Persians or the music of the t6r (one of the students had a tAr, a Persian stringed instrument) had taken her memories back to those days.' 

 Marjory Morten in her tribute to the Greatest Holy Leaf makes a touching observation which is accurase as far as my own experiences go: 'She delighted in making presents — sweetmeats  and goodies and coins for the children, and for others flowers, keepsakes — a vial of attar of roses, a rosary, or some delicate thing that she had used and cared for. Anything that was given her she one day gave to someone else, someone in whom she felt a special need of a special favour. She was channel rather than cup; open treasury, not locked casket.' 

 I have selected just four brief passages from the memoir written by the Hand of the Cause Keith 

Ransom-Kehier. These       

 passages ring true: 'On two occasions she removed my Baha'i ring and after holding it for some time replaced it reversed. Twice she blew on the palm of my hand, a sweet, cool, delicious breath and then exultantly exclaimed: "It is all right now." 

 'She would reach out her delicate hand and, pressing my cheek close against her own, would make some lover-like exclamation. 

 I was dissolved by her sweetness. 

 'For the most part she would chant in a low

  delicious voice some glorious Tablet or poem, soothing my hand or holding me under the chin as she sang. 

 'Every Sunday she insisted in going to the meeting on Mt. Carmel: she had to be lifted in and out of the car.' 

 Keith Ransom-Kehier refers here to the last time she met Baha'i KMnum toward the close of her life; she was here in March 1932, not long before the passing of the Greatest Holy 

Leaf.                      

 As to my own memories, perhaps I could present one or two vignettes. 

 The first I call 'a mouthful from Kh6num but not Kh6num's mouthful'. 
I say this because in      

The Priceless Pearl Abdu'l-Baha

 Rhhfyyih KhAnum refers to KhAnum's mouthful, and she did so again in her remarks this morning. 

 About 1926 or 1927, when I was about five or six years old, I came to the Master's house with my mother one hot afternoon — it was probably during the summer months — and the door of the house was open. 

The Greatest Holy Leaf     

 was seated next to the big round table which is still there in the hail of the Master's house. 

 The samovar was next to her and around this table were seated Munfrih Kh6num and the daughters of 'Abdu'l-Baha. We reached the hail and stood there and bowed, I following my mother's example. Khdnum looked at us and told us to come in. She was having tea. As I came closer I saw that she was having fresh Arabic bread, white cheese and fresh mint. These were placed on the table. She had made one mouthful of bread, cheese and mint, apparently intending to have it herself. It was ready to be eaten and she was still holding it in her hand. As we approached she asked me to come forward and I moved closer to her. She then asked me to close my eyes and I dutifully closed them. Then she said, 'Open your mouth!' and she put the tidbit in my mouth. So vivid is this experience that every time I recall it I feel that I can taste that fresh mint, bread and cheese from the hand of the Greatest Holy Leaf. I feel and taste it every time I bring the incident to memory. 

 My brother, JaTM, was two years older than I was. The second story is about him. I was not present on one occasion when he was leaving the presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf. It was at the time of the mandate when we had British currency. 

 She placed one shilling in his hand and said, 'Jahi, here is a shilling, half for you and half for your brother.' JaN said 'But Kmnum, bow can I break this coin?' 

 She laughed and beckoned him to her and gave him another shilling. 'This one is for your brother.' 

 Many were the times my brother and I had sweetmeats, nuts, cookies and other goodies in her room. Often she was tired and would be seated or in bed. She would say, 'Bring that box from under the mandar. 

 Bring it out —  that's right, bring it out. Now open it. Take one for yourself and give one to your brother.' How many times I have gone into that room in great reverence and knelt down, as we used to before the portraits of Baha'u'llah and the Bab, and watched while the Greatest Holy Leaf sat there reverently unveiling the portraits  and then closing them up again after the viewing was over. 

 We have heard of the delight the Greatest Holy Leaf took in giving presents. 

Mr. Abu'1-Q6sim  Faizi     

 describes an event he witnessed when some Arab women came to pay a visit. Baha'i KlAnum wanted to give them something,  but finding nothing in her room she requested that some sugar cubes be brought from the kitchen and she presented them to her guests. She always wanted to give gifts to others. 

 The story I will now relate, although not all of it refers to the Greatest Holy Leaf, illustrates what I witnessed of the tender relationship between the Greatest Holy Leaf and 

Shoghi Effendi. Once       

 our mother asked my brother and I to go to the Master's house after prayers at the Shrine of the BTh. 

 In those days the Guardian was younger and, following prayers, he would walk down to Abbas Street and, the terraces beyond Abbas Street not yet having been built, he would turn to the right on Abbas Street, and then proceed to Hapar-sim  Street and straight down to the Master's house. The pilgrims would usually walk with him. 

 On that particular day my brother and I, too, followed Shoghi Effendi because we thought how much better it was to go to the Master's house with him. When Shoghi Effendi  reached the gate he turned and said, 'H Amdni'lldh' (May you be under God's protection)  and went in. Being younger than Jal6.1, I was glad to follow him when he set out after


<p64>

Shoghi Effendi. The Guardian

 went up the stairs and we did, too, and then entered the house. It was the custom of the Guardian to have his one major meal each day with the Greatest Holy Leaf. 

 It was also his practice to go to her after meeting with the pilgrims and sit and talk to her. Shoghi Effendi turned right to go through the corridor next to the room in which the Master passed away and proceeded to the next room which was the Greatest 

Holy Leafs bedroom. He    

 went along that corridor and we followed, and when he opened the door I was so close to Shoghi Effendi at that point that I saw that the Greatest Holy Leaf was in bed. As soon as she heard the footsteps of Shoghi Effendi and the opening of the door she was at the point of rising from bed to sit in the presence of the Guardian. 

 Although the distance is not far from the door to the bed, Shoghi Effendi literally ran from the door to the bed and gently restrained her, saying 'Jd'iz fist' (it is not permissible). He did not want her to be disturbed. 

 There is a little sequel to this incident and although it does not directly relate to the Greatest Holy Leaf, since we have begun the story, let me finish it. In the room of KhAnum, Shoghi Effendi seated himself. My brother and I, with childish aplomb, sat down too. Then my mother found out what had happened  and sent the maid immediately to tell us to come out. 

 The door was opened again and with a motion of her eyes the maid signalled us to leave. Jaldi very reverently stood and bowed and withdrew from the room. But I thought this wasn't right; I thought, 'This is not the way to do things!' I felt there should be a handshake. 

 This, of course, was totally inappropriate but to my childish mind it seemed the proper thing to do. I went straight over to Shoghi Effendi who was seated in a deep comfortable armchair and offered him my little hand. Shoghi Effendi looked at me and pulled himself closer, accepted my hand and shook it. This all took time. 

 When I went outside my mother asked me what had delayed  me and I explained that my brother didn't shake hands and I thought I should. She was horrified and struck my hand, saying, 'Out of reverence for the Guardian you should have done exactly what your brother did.' 

 Of course, I felt very bad about this. As we were going home my mother asked again, incredulously, 'You shook hands?' 
     I said, 'Yes.'            

 'With your right hand?' 'Of course.' 
'Give me your hand.'      

 I did, and she kissed it several times. 

      When the Greatest Holy    

 Leaf passed away in her eighty-sixth year, on 15 JuLy 1932, an announcement was printed in Haifa and distributed to everyone concerned, Baha'is and others, in Haifa, 'Akka and Jerusalem. At the top is set out stanza 33 of the Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah, from the Arabic: 0 Son of Spirit! 

 With the joyful tidings of light I hail thee: rejoice! To the court of holiness I summon thee; abide therein that thou mayest live in peace for evermore. Baha'u'llah. 

 Then it states: 'The family of the late Sir 'Abdu'l-Baha 'Abbas announces with profound  sorrow the death of Baha'i KMnum, sister of the late Sir 'Abdu'l-Baha 'Abbas, who passed away peacefully at 1 am. on the morning of July 15. 

 The funeral procession from her home in the Persian Colony is at 4:30 p.m. Saturday, July 15th.' 

 The passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf was the most significant event in Haifa since the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Many people gathered  for the funeral; indeed, there were a hundred cars following the procession. Shoghi Effendi obviously was not in Haifa. Apart from many dignitaries, the Mayor of Haifa was present and the representative of the northern district. 

 There were people present not only from Haifa, but 'AkM, Abii-SinAn, Nablus, Jaffa and Jerusalem, and of course the Baha were present. The prayer for the dead was read in the Master's house in the main hail. Some of the friends served as pallbearers.  The coffin was raised shoulder high on the shoulders of the friends and carried from the Master's house up to the Shrine. The coffin was brought in not through the main gate but through the small gate next to the school, almost immediately above the cluster of cypress trees where Baha'u'llah sat, and then down the path to the Shrine. As I recall, it was not taken inside but was placed outside and prayers were read there as well. Then her coffin was raised again and carried along the same route to her resting-place. The site was chosen by Shoghi Effendi and he himself had


<p65>
THE COMMEMORATION OF HISTORIC ANNIVERSARIES                                    65

  instructed his father in Haifa exactly where the site should be and how the burial should take place. Shoghi Effendi also instructed the Baha to visit her resting-place every day for nine days. 

 Every afternoon for nine days we gathered at her resting-place for prayers. 

 There were among the local Arabs those who had written eulogies (Marthiyyih) about the Greatest Holy Leaf and they wanted to read them. There was no time on the day of the funeral so this was set aside because evening came on and everybody had to go home. Very soon requests were made for a meeting in the Master's house for these poets and various officials to come and, as is the custom, offer condolences to the family, recite poems written in honour of the Greatest Holy Leaf and speak words of praise in her memory.  This was immediately reported to Shoghi Effendi who said no. Instead, he said that on the fortieth day after her passing a luncheon should be held for the poor and all else who might come. On the 25th of August all the friends gathered. 

 Some of us were cooking, others were cleaning, others were laying tables and others were serving. 

 Your humble servant was among those who were serving. A long table was laid seating 100 people. We had ten or eleven turnovers; over 1,000 people came. This is how it went on until 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon. A tent had been erected in the garden where those waiting to be seated could shelter from the hot summer sun. Shoghi Effendi also gave the sum of £100 —  a considerable amount in those days — to the municipality of Haifa asking that it be distributed to the needy in the name of the Greatest Holy Leaf. 

 An announcement was made in the papers and the municipality set up a special committee to screen applications for assistance and distribute the money to those genuinely in need. 

 Before I conclude let me mention the hands of the Greatest Holy Leaf. 

 The veins stood out visibly, very much in relief. 

 There was a wonderful softness and a supple tenderness in her hands. 

 She truly spoke with her hands. I have had the privilege of having her hand over my head; she stroked my head many times as a child. And I want to tell you I have kissed those hands many times; I have broken the law of the Kitab-i-Aqdas! 

 I can conclude with no more fitting tribute than that of Shoghi Effendi. 

 This is such a beautiful description of Khdnum: It would take me too long to make even a brief allusion to those incidents of her life, each of which eloquently proclaims her as a daughter, worthy to inherit that priceless heritage bequeathed to her by Baha'u'llah. A purity of life that reflected itself in even the minutest details of her daily occupations and activities; a tenderness of heart that obliterated every distinction of creed, class and colour; a resignation and serenity that evoked to the mind the calm and heroic fortitude of the Bib; a natural fondness of flowers and children that was so characteristic of Baha'u'llah; an unaffected simplicity of manners; an extreme sociability which made her accessible to all; a generosity, a love, at once disinterested and undiscriminating, that reflected so clearly the attributes of 'Abdu'l-Baha's character; a sweetness of temper; a cheerfulness that no amount of sorrow could becloud; a quiet and unassuming disposition that served to enhance a thousandfold the prestige of her exalted rank; a forgiving nature that instantly  disarmed the most unyielding enemy — these rank among the outstanding attributes  of a saintly life which history will acknowledge as having been endowed with a celestial potency that few of the heroes of the past possessed. 

  And then these beautiful words: 

  Dearly-beloved Greatest    

 Holy Leaf! Through the mist of tears that fill my eyes I can clearly see, as I pen these lines, thy noble figure before me, and can recognize the serenity of thy kindly face. I can still gaze, though the shadows of the grave separate us, into thy blue, love-deep eyes, and can feel in its calm intensity, the immense love thou did'st bear for the Cause of thine Almighty Father, the attachment that bound thee to the most lowly and insignificant among its followers, the warm affection thou didst cherish for me in thine heart. The memory of the ineffable beauty of thy smile shall ever continue to cheer and hearten me in the thorny path I am destined to pursue. The remembrance of the touch of thine hand shall ~pur me on

Abdu'l-Baha Riihiyyih   

 KhAnurn spoke of praying to the Greatest Holy Leaf. I want to make a confession. For the past fifty years since her passing, every time I have had a very difficult, difficult problem that I found myself unable to resolve, I have turned to the Greatest 1-joly 

Leaf.

THE BAHA'I WORLD
10. THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF THE GREATEST HOLY LEAF'

  Baha'i Nakhj av~ni A. CROSS the world, from East to West, thousands of Baha'is have turned their hearts this year towards one single woman called the 'Maid of Bah&. 

 In conferences they have stood before multitudes to speak of the 'Scion of Bah&, the 'Remnant of Bah6'. In solitude they have all found themselves speechless to describe adequately this 'archetype of the people of Bah&. 

'Abdu'l-Baha Himself      

 refers to her in a way that recalls all that cannot be said: 'I dare make no mention', He wrote, 'of the feelings which separation from her have aroused in my heart     I do not know', He continues, 'in what words I could describe my longing for my honoured sister.' 

 Shoghi Effendi, writing about his great-aunt after her passing in July 1932 also acknowledged  that words could not adequately convey  all that she was: 'Not even a droplet of all thine endless love can I aspire to fathom, nor can I adequately praise and tell of even the most trifling out of all the events of thy precious life.' 

 How can we hope to encompass anything of her nature, therefore, when those who give us the words remind us that they will not suffice? How can we contain her when all our lives put together cannot comprehend the least trifling of the events she witnessed, the suffering she endured? 

 It must be with feelings of awe that we approach this subject and with a sense of wonder that we ask who was this 'Maid' this 'Scion', this 'Remnant of Baha' who must remain for all of time our archetype'. 
     She was named Baha'i    

(Baha'u'llah) by Baha'u'llah.

 She was given the titles of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Most Exalted Leaf, but in her letters she referred to herself as 'this yearning prisoner', 'this lowly and grief-stricken  maidservant', 'this wronged one'. In the writings of Shoghi Effendi we find expressions  which have captured something of her nature and his wonderful imagery speaks where we fall silent. She has been called a Adapted from the address of Dr. Baha'i Nakhjav~nf to the Baha International Conference, Montreal, Qu6bec, 3 September 1982. 
'leaf      sprung' from the

'Preexistent Root', 'the 

 fruit of His Tree, the lamp of His love, the symbol of His serenity .' He calls her a 'love-loin moth', a soaring pillar', a 'rich mine of faithfulness', an 'orb in the heaven of eternal glory'. She holds a rank in this dispensation that is higher than any other woman can hold. 

 Her station is one among those that revolve arodnd the greater Manifestations of the past, those women who, like moths, revolved around the great suns of the previous Manifestations. Baha'u'llah wrote of her in these words: 'Verily, We have elevated thee to the rank of one of the most distinguished among thy sex, and granted thee, in My court, a station such as none other woman hath surpassed.' 

 During the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha her station was similarly exalted. 

 Shoghi Effendi described her as a 'staunch and trusted supporter of the peerless Branch of Bah&, 'a companion to Him beyond compare', 'His competent deputy', 'His representative and vicegerent with none to equal her'. Shoghi Effendi also describes how much she meant to him during the first years of his own ministry, until her passing. 

 He says she was 'my sole earthly sustainer', 'my most affectionate comforter', 'the joy and inspiration of my life'. 

     The Greatest Hoiy Leaf    
had a subtle bond with    

Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha  

 and Shoghi Effendi, a kinship that was infinitely tender and powerful. To Baha'u'llah she was far more than a daughter for she was like a mirror in which His good pleasure was exquisitely reflected. 

 He says to her, 'How sweet to see thy presence before Me, how sweet to gaze upon thy face.' 

 To 'Abdu'l-Baha she was far more than a sister, for in letters of consuming tenderness He writes to her as '0 My sister in the spirit and the companion of My heart, the beloved of My soul'. After her passing the secretary of Shoghi Effendi wrote of what she meant to the Guardian saying that the spiritual attachment he felt for her was 'a bond so strong as to defy description, nor can the mind encompass that exalted state'.

  haps it is not presumptuous, therefore, if we should say that this subtle and mystic bond is still present with us today working through the Covenant of God, through the divinely ordained  administrative order of God, and that her loving care and protection are with us still. Indeed, it can be no coincidence that the Universal House of Justice should have summoned  the Baha'i world to remember her, fifty years after her passing, at a time which coincides with the year in which the House of Justice is itself advancing toward the plenitude of its powers, entering its Seat on the slopes of Mount Carmel, occupying a building set like a jewel on that arc at whose hub and centre lies enshrined the monument of the Greatest 1-Ioiy Leaf. That subtle bond was a legacy given to us fifty years ago when she passed away. Today we receive that legacy again and none of us needs feel portionless or orphaned. 

 The following cannot pretend to be an historical account and is not intended as a source of biographical detail. Instead it will attempt to consider the degree of suffering experienced by the Greatest Holy Leaf, her service that gradually widened its sphere of influence as a result of that suffering, and finally the nature of the symbol that she is for us, not only as individuals but as members of institutions. The greatness of her station can only be measured by her obedience and her love for the Covenant of God. Her obedience and love for the Covenant is what ensured her proximity to the Centre of the Covenant throughout her life, and that proximity surely cannot be measured except by some reflection on the degree to which she suffered. 

     The Greatest Holy Leaf    

 was an initiate of suffering, schooled in sacrifice, and she learned everything there was to know about loss. 

 From the earliest years of her life she was deprived not only of home and security, but also of her dearest Father, when He was thrown into the SfyTh-Chdi and later when He removed Himself for two years from the community in BaghdAd. 

Separation from Baha'u'llah

 and exile from her home: such were the experiences that marked the begin-fling of her life. In His letters to her later we read how 'Abdu'l-Baha's was one of the educating voices that trained her in the school of sacrifice and instilled in her the capacity to endure. He wrote, 'If thou dost not bear these hardships, who would ever bear them?' And this is what makes of her such a poignant symbol for us today. He counsels her at times of loneliness with words such as, 'However great the distance that separates us, we still feel as though we were seated under the same roof, in one and the same gathering, for are we not all under the shadow of the Tabernacle of God and beneath the canopy of His infinite grace and mercy?' Through her, therefore, we learn from 

Him.                      

 During these early years of separation and sacrifice during which she lost one brother, and later in 'Akka lost yet another, Mirza Mihdi, she played the role of auxiliary in the household, assisting her mother. Most of her services were internal, within the household. 

 She served tea. We can imagine how much she must have learned from the mother who was so dear to her, with what joy she must have prepared for the return of Baha'u'llah from Su1aym~nfyyih. She was herself never married, but that training she received as assistant to her own mother made of her a symbol of such maternal love as we cannot conceive, for she was entirely unpossessive in her mothering. When she died Shoghi Effendi wrote that we were orphaned, left destitute, for the whole Baha'i world at that time seemed under her protective  care. 

 If we think of this quality in relation to individuals we see how often we may be called upon to be mothers to each other, no matter who we are. When we think of this quality in relation to the institutions of the Faith we realize that we surely have in our Assemblies a parent whom we can turn to with absolute trust if those institutions could also evince the characteristics of such gentle mothering. However the institutions need to be cared for also, and mothered, for this is the infant Faith of God. And modelling ourselves upon the Greatest Holy Leaf we, too, can try to extend that mothering, that generosity, that nurture, that nourishment to the infant institutions that are growing up all over the world. 

 It was around 1886 when the Greatest Holy Leaf had to endure the loss of her own mother. At that point in time Baha'i Kh6num received the title of 

'The Greatest Holy Leaf'. 

 She took over the role of her mother, was at the helm of the household of


<p70>
70                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Baha'u'llah, conducted the management of the affairs of the house, saw to the food that had to be bought and prepared, met the wives of the pilgrims and extended her love and generosity to the community of women who entered that house. Her loss was therefore paralleled by increased responsibility and this pattern was repeated throughout her life. 

 In 1892 she had to face the 'supreme affliction', the passing of Baha'u'llah, and the degree of that suffering was what nerved her to enter an even wider arena of service to the Cause. 

 Her condition at that time was such that 'Abdu'l-Baha wrote, 'My sister for a considerable period, that is, from the day of Baha'u'llah's ascension, had grown so thin and feeble and was in such a weakened condition from the anguish of her mourning that she was close to breakdown.' 

 But it is such a lady who was nevertheless able to stand as the supporter and companion of 'Abdu'l-Baha at a time of severe crisis. 

 Her role in the Baha community at this point was much more significant, for she had to receive on His behalf the wives of the dignitaries who came to visit the World Centre. Still she conducted the household affairs but the scope was now wider. 

 Shoghi Effendi writes of how far-reaching  was her generosity and compassion for the people of 'Akka at that time and how, in spite of this, she was met with rejection and denial and was given no relief at the time of her own great grief. During the last years in 'Akka, before the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, when circumstances were so difficult and the life of 'Abdu'l-Baha alP was under threat, it was the Greatest Holy Leaf who was trusted by Him, who was the custodian of His will, who was responsible for the safe keeping of His testament. She it was in whose room the casket of the Blessed Mb was kept for ten years because she was so trusted by 'Abdu'l-Baha  In this way, surely, she is also a model for us not oniy within our individual lives but through our institutions, for where else could we turn in a world so sadly shaken? 

 Where else but toward the solace of those divinely appointed institutions? To which other haven could we turn and put our trust and confidence? 

    The Greatest Holy Leaf     

 was an extremely practical person. Indeed, due to the extraordinary  multiplicity of her capacities we owe her a faithfulness in this attempt to convey the diversity of her nature. 

 It is too easy for us to create a myth about her, to impose upon her the weight and strain of our twentieth-century interpretations which are inadequate for the duration of this mighty dispensation. 

 She was truly sensitive and finely tuned but she was also immensely practical. There is a description  drawn by an early pilgrim which shows her as the housekeeper of 'Abdu'l-Baha, a role which she also performed during the early years of Shoghi Effendi's ministry: 'One day we caught a glimpse of her in the kitchen seated on a low stool, her firm capable hands busy with a large lamb that had just been brought in from the market. Quickly dividing it, she directed which part was to be made into broth, which part served for the evening meal, which part kept for the morrow, and which sent to those poor or incapacitated friends who were daily supplied from 'Abdu'l-Baha's table.' 

 It is fitting that we should consider the Greatest Holy Leaf as a model not only for our individual lives but for the qualities of service and the kind of obedience to the Covenant which can stream through our institutions, when we think of her in this capacity of practical housekeeper. 

 Our institutions  are dealing with our lives. 

 It is human beings that are passing through the hands of our assemblies. 

 We must have not only tender compassion for them but be immensely practical  in our manner of dealing with community affairs so as not to cause harm or hardship or waste. 

 During the trials that affected 'Abdu'l-Baha, during the threat on His life, the capacities of the Greatest Holy Leaf as housewife and mother enabled her to support 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 In a much deeper sense than mere external practicality, she evihced a stability that was rooted in steadfastness to the Covenant. Shoghi Effendi says of that period, 'Suffice it to say that but for her sleepless vigilance, her tact, her courtesy, her extreme patience and heroic fortitude, grave complications might have ensued and the load of 'Abdu'l-Baha's anxious care would have been considerably increased.' 

 It was an element of her very practical nature that she did not wish to burden 'Abdu'l-Baha any more than was necessary, and protected. Him with her discretion.

  What joy it must have given her when the imprisonment was lifted and her beloved brother was permitted to be free and travel to the West! 

 This was one separation the cost of which she surely did not mind paying, for the letters that streamed back to her from Europe and America must have filled her heart with happiness. 

 The victories of the Faith were great recompense for all her previous suffering.  And when He left her in Haifa, 'Abdu'l-Baha gave her a much wider role. In His absence she had to deal with many of the affairs in Haifa which had been His responsibility. 

 Everything which did not require interaction with the male world was left to her, because we must remember that this was the Middle East and it would not have been fitting for a lady such as the Greatest Holy Leaf to deal with business affairs; such matters were taken care of by the male members of 'Abdu'l-Baha's household. But nevertheless her sphere of influence was wider and she received both men and women dignitaries and officials, spoke to the pilgrims on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Baha inspired them, gave her assistance to the poor and offered her medical services to the sick. 

 Shortly after 'Abdu'l-Baha returned to the Holy Land after His travels in the West, World War I broke out. The Greatest Holy Leaf was in a position to offer some needed help to the local community. 

 Shoghi Effendi writes that 'her words of cheer and comfort, the food, the money, the clothing she freely dispensed, the remedies which by a process of her own she herself prepared and diligently applied, all these had their share in comforting the disconsolate.' 

 Here again we might consider how much she is a model for us not only as individuals but as institutions. She was a natural healer. She not only had compassion for the sick but insight into the nature of their sickness and she offered remedies which she prepared, as Shoghi Effendi said, by 'a process of her own'. We might bear this in mind when we think of how often our Assemblies need to be a source of healing for the community, how they are required to consider each individual case, diagnose the condition, prescribe the remedies in the same way she did, so that by means of prevention, the health of the community might be ensured. We are told that she turned to professionals when necessary; so, too, do the institutions. 

 Through her own suffering she became attuned to the needs of the community and the importance of her role increased. The next great blow in her life came in 1921 with the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 The One Who had always been there to comfort her was now gone, and now she became the comforter. 

 It is at this point in her life that we begin to bear her own voice speaking in the beautiful tablets which have been translated by the Universal House of Justice for us this year. Among them there is one prayer that rises from the depths of her anguish and in it she becomes a spokesman for the suffering masses of the world. She speaks in the language of the heart on behalf of all who have been downtrodden, who have been suppressed, who have experienced a separation and Loss of such magnitude  that she alone could understand their plight: 

  '0 God, my God!           

 'Thou seest me immersed in the depths of grief, drowned in my sorrow, my heart on fire with the agony of parting, my inmost self aflame with longing. Thou seest my tears streaming down, hearest my sighs rising up like smoke, my never-ceasing groans, my cries, my shouts that will not be stilled, the useless wailing of my heart. 

 'For the sun of joy has set, has sunk below the horizon of this world, and in the hearts of the righteous the lights of courage and consolation have gone out. So grave this catastrophe, so dire this disaster, that the inner being crumbles away to dust. 

  Where else could we find a spokesman who could so speak on our behalf about our deepest anguish? 

 We know now why she has been offered to us as an intercessor, as one to whom we might turn at times of great despair. It seems most fitting that we reach toward her first, beg her assistance, ask for her compassion,  because she has so keenly felt the pain of being human. 

 She was no mediator between man and God, nor a mystery given by God to man, but simply a woman whose voice calling upon God seems universal in its truth and its sincerity. So, too, our institutions might echo that voice of compassion for us, might speak on our behalf when we feel

  downtrodden, might raise up the cry for the oppressed among humanity. Only the institutions  of God can do that and be truly heard. 

 The passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha which was so dire a catastrophe nevertheless left the Greatest  Holy Leaf standing responsible for a Cause that needed its Guardian. 

 This truly was her ultimate role for at that time she was the one who cabled the Baha world, who arranged for the funeral of 'Abdu'l-Baha, who held us and contained our broken hearts until Shoghi Effendi was ready to shoulder the burden of his ministry. 

 Her letters that went out to the East and West at that time are among the most wonderful teaching letters that we have. 

 She taught the Baha'is about the importance of the Covenant. She taught them to revere and love their Guardian. She taught them about the nature of the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha She encouraged them to be united and warned them against disharmony. These letters show her truly as a teacher of the Cause, another of the roles set as a model for us. In one of these letters she uses the meta

  phor of healing to teach, and she reminds the friends in very simple and direct language, without wasting words, that when a patient is ill he needs a potent remedy. Since the world had sustained a violent shock at the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha she writes, 'Now it devolves upon every well-assured and devoted friend, every firm and enkindled believer enraptured by His love, to drink this healing remedy [she was referring to Shoghi Effendi] at one draught, so that the agony of bereavement may be somewhat alleviated and the bitter anguish of separation dissipated.' 

 She was always trying to help us endure separation, but her own separations were not completely over, for during the first three years of the ministry of Shoghi Effendi she had to endure many partings from him too. Among her letters there is one so touching that it awakens us to remember how keenly she must have felt these separations in her declining years: 'It is the hope of this writer that the friends of God will put forth such efforts, and will so radiate their love for Him, as to light up the world; a love that will make the heart of the Guardian leap for joy, and then, God willing, he will soon come back again, so that before I close my eyes upon this life, the separation I endure will be over, and I can bid you all farewell with a happy heart.' 

  One of the characteristics of the Greatest Holy Leaf was her ability to endure suffering with the utmost joy reflected on her face. After her passing Shoghi Effendi's secretary wrote, 'Even in the thick of the worst ordeals she would smile like an opening rose.' It is a smile that lingers with us still, a smile that looks at us with tenderness through the photographs. Within this smile there is so much of radiance and sorrow, so much of understanding; it is a smile so deep that we might feel it penetrating our inmost hearts. Memory lies evanescent on the eyes but rises from the deepest recess of the heart and there is something in our own hearts that must needs respond to the Greatest Holy Leaf, radiant in the midst of her anguish. 

 Just as her own heart retained the treasured traces of the heroic age of Baha history, so our hearts too are revived and refreshed by 'those smiles' of hers exquisitely described by Shoghi Effendi which have been 'forever and faithfully imprinted' there. It is in the portrait drawn by his pen that we draw closest to her, gaze into her 'blue, love-deep eyes', bask in the warmth and 'ineffable beauty' of her smile, feel the tender touch of her transparent hand and hear the sweet magic' of her voice. 

 No photograph transcends 'the shadows of the grave' as his words do; no commentary could contain her memory as does his paean of love. Through him we first learned of her contributions to the Baha'i world and at her passing he conveyed to us, through the memory of her life, 'a legacy that time can never dim'. 

 But he does even more on our behalf, for he invites us to stand with him, at the threshold of her passing, and make a solemn promise. It is a promise so binding that fifty years after that event we recall it with awe and a dawning comprehension. 

 It is a promise that reminds us not only of the legacy we have received but of the legacy we must pass on to the future. 

 It is a promise that inspires us to rededicate our lives once more and revive within our institutions those qualities evinced by the life and service of the Greatest Holy Leaf. 

 'Whatever betide us,' is his solemn oath, 'however distressing the vicissitudes which the nascent Faith of God may yet experience, we pledge ourselves, before the mercy-seat of Thy glorious Father, to hand on, unimpaired and undivided, to generations yet unborn, the glory of that tradition of which thou hast been its most brilliant exemplar.'

THE HOUSE OF 'ABDU'LLAH PASHA

 THE renovation of the House of 'Abdu'Ilah PAshd, a building whose acquisition was a supplementary achievement of the Five Year Plan (1974 — 1979), was completed by Ridvan 1983. Thus the delegates to the fifth International Convention in the Holy Land were privileged to be the first pilgrims to visit this historic site and enjoy the meticulous work of restoration, and the refurnishing, beautifully and faithfully accomplished under the supervision of Abdu'l-Baha Rahfyyih KhAnum. 

 In its cablegram of 14 January 1975 to all National Spiritual Assemblies the Universal House of Justice informed the Baha'i world: 

JOYOUSLY ANNOUNCE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION LENGTHY DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS RESULTING
G ACQUISITION BY PURCHASE HOLY HOUSE CENTRE COVENANT ABDU'L-BAHA BIRTHPLACE

WESTERN PILGRIMS. PLANS BEING PREPARED RESTORATION HOLY HOUSE BEAUTIFICATION

PERMIT. OFFER HUMBLE THANKSGIVING BAHA'U'LLAH THIS GREAT BLESSING.

 The poignancy of the role of Abdu'l-Baha Riihfyyih KhAnum in refurbishing the house of 'Abdu'116h P6sht is heightened when it is called to mind that her mother, the illustrious May (Bolles) Maxwell, was a member of that first party of Western pilgrims who in 1898 were received by 'Abdu'l-Baha in that house, and that it was the birthplace e of Shoghi Effendi whose 'helpmate', 'shield' and 'tireless collaborator' she was to become. 

 Indeed, as the Universal House of Justice reminded the Baha'i world, 'some of the most dramatic and historically significant events of the Heroic Age of the Baha'i Faith are associated with the house of 'Abdu'116h PAshA which derives its name from the Governor of 'Akka who built it and used it as his official residence during his term of office from 1820 to 1832 In this house, fifty lunar years after the BTh's martyrdom, in January 1899, the casket containing His sacred and precious remains was received by 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who successfully concealed it until it was possible to inter it, with all honours, in its permanent resting-place in the bosom of Carmel. In this house 'Abdu'l-Baha was confined during the period of His renewed incarceration. 

 and from this house He directed the construction of the BTh's sepulchre on Mount Carmel, erected under its shadow His own house in Haifa, and later the Pilgrim House, issued instructions for the restoration of the Bab's holy House in SHr~z and for the erection of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the world in the city of Ishqabad. It was in this house that His celebrated table talks were given and compiled, to be published later under the title Some Answered Questions. In this house and in the darkest hours of a period which the beloved Guardian describes as "the most dramatic period of His ministry", "in the heyday of His life and in the full tide of His power" He penned the first part of His Will and Testament, which delineates the features and lays the foundations of the Administrative Order to arise after His Passing. In this house He revealed the highly significant Tablet addressed to the BTh's cousin and chief builder of the 'Ishqabad Temple, a Tablet whose import can be appreciated and grasped only as future events unfold before our eyes, and in which, as testified by Shoghi Effendi, 'Abdu'l-Baha "in stirring terms proclaimed the immeasurable greatness of the Revelation of the Bin, sounded the warning foreshadowing the turmoil which its enemies, both far and near, would Let loosp upon the world, and

  prophesied, in moving language, the ascendancy which the torchbearer of the Covenant would ultimately achieve over them" It was to this house that the historic first group of pilgrims from the West came to see the Master in the winter of 1898 — 1899, and in which many more from both East and West sought His presence In this house was born the child ordained to hold the destiny of the Faith in his hands for thirty-six years and to become its "beloved Guardian", the child named "Shoghi" by his Grandfather, who grew up under His loving and solicitous care and became the recipient of His Tablets.' 

 Barely five years after the passing of Baha'u'llah it became apparent that the portion of the House of 'Abbild available for occupation was inadequate for Tills enlarged family. In the autumn of 1896 'Abdu'l-Baha 'with characteristic vigour' took action and, in the months preceding the birth of Shoghi Effendi, arranged to rent the main building, and subsequently the subsidiary wings, of the house of 'Abdu'116h PAshA in the Muj~da1ih Quarter in the northwestern corner of 'Akka. He established it as His official residence, and also as a home for His daughters, their husbands and families. 

 Thus it came about that in March 1897, in an upper room of the wing facing south, Shoghi Effendi was born in that house which was to witness so many events of vital importance to the Faith and to the future of mankind. 

 In September 1977 the Universal House of Justice approved the plans for restoration prepared by Mr. Ridv~nu'llTh Ashraf, a young Persian Baha architect. 

 The actual work was started three months later by a team of Persian Baha'is with experience of reconstructing certain of the Holy Places in Iran. Some of the work was let out on contract. The task of renovation was extensive and was pursued steadily with a view to hastening the time when this priceless residence would be opened for pilgrimage. No less than two hundred and sixty doors and windows, patterned on the originals, had to be made and installed. The roof had to be reconstructed and surfaced

In addition to repairs to the interior and exterior structure, it was necessary to repair the south and west walls surrounding the property, a project which called for approximately seven hundred cubic metres of stone and cement. Plans have also been prepared to lay out the garden, repair the pooi in the central yard and to re-floor the entrance. 

 No effort has been spared in faithfully restoring this historic building to its condition at the time when it was occupied by the Master and the Holy Family. All available documents and photographs were closely studied, and the remains of the old building were carefully traced. Of inestimable value to the project were the detailed personal memories of the late Mrs. Zeenat (Zinat) Baghd~df, who was a member of the household in the time of 'Abdu'l-Baha The upper rooms of the house were, at the request of the Universal House of Justice, exquisitely and carefully furnished in the style of the period by Abdu'l-Baha Riihiyyih KMnum whose successful effort will inspire, no less in future pilgrims than in the fortunate first, profound reverence and heartfelt gratitude.

Excerpts from the message of the Universal House of Justice to the Baha'is of the world,

                    Naw-Rtiz 1979

  THE decline of religious and moral restraints has unleashed a fury of chaos and confusion that already bears the signs of universal anarchy. 

 Engulfed in this maelstrom, the Baha'i world community, pursuing with indefeasible unity and spiritual force its redemptive mission, inevitably suffers the disruption of economic, social and civil life which afflicts its fellow men throughput the planet. It must also bear particular tribulations. 

 The violent disturbances in Persia, coinciding with the gathering in of the bounti-hi  harvest of the Five Year Plan, have brought new and cruel hardships to our longsuffering brethren in the Cradle of our Faith and confronted the Baha world community with critical challenges to its life and work. As the Baha'i world stood poised on the brink of victory, eagerly anticipating the next stage in the unfoldment of the Master's 

Divine Plan, Baha'u'llah's

 heroic compatriots, the custodians  of the Holy Places of our Faith in the land of its birth, were yet again called upon to endure the passions of brutal mobs, the looting and burning of their homes, the destruction of their means of livelihood, and physical violence and threats of death to force them to recant their faith. They, like their immortal forebears, the Dawn-Breakers, are standing steadfast in face of this new persecution and the ever-present threat of organized extermination. 

 'Remembering that during the Five Year Plan the Persian friends far surpassed any other national community in their outpouring of pioneers and funds, we, in all those parts of the world where we are still free to promote the Cause of God, have the responsibility to make good their temporary inability to serve. Therefore, with uplifted hearts and radiant faith, we must arise with redoubled energy to pursue our mighty task, confident that the Lord of Hosts will continue to reward our efforts with the same bountiful grace He vouchsafed to us in the Five Year Plan. 

 'The teaching victories in that Plan have been truly prodigious; the points of light, those localities where the Promised One is recognized, have increased from sixty-nine thousand five hundred to over ninety-six thousand; the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies has grown from seventeen thousand  to over twenty-five thousand; eighteen new 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 have been formed. The final report will disclose in all their manifold aspects the magnitude of the victories won. 

 'In the world at large the Baha'i community is now firmly established. 

 The Institution of the Hands of the Cause of 

God, the Chief Stewards   

 of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth, is bearing a precious fruit in the development of the International Teaching Centre as a mighty institution of the World Centre of the Faith; an institution blessed by the membership of all the Hands of the Cause; an institution whose beneficent influence is diffused to all parts of the Baha'i community through the Continental Boards of Counsellors,  the members of the Auxiliary Boards and their assistants 'The conditions of the world present the 81

  followers of Baha'u'llah with both obstacles and opportunities. In an increasing number of countries we are witnessing the fulfilment of the warnings that the writings of our Faith contain. "Peoples, nations, adherents of divers faiths," the beloved Guardian wrote, "will jointly and successively arise to shatter its unity, to sap its force, and to degrade its holy name. 

 They will assail not oniy the spirit which it inculcates, but the administration which is the channel, the instrument, the embodiment of that spirit. For as the authority with which Baha'u'llah has invested the future Baha Commonwealth becomes more and more apparent, the fiercer shall be the challenge which from every quarter will be thrown at the verities it enshrines." 

 In different  countries, in varying degrees, the followers  of Baha'u'llah at this very hour are undergoing such attacks, and are facing imprisonment  and even martyrdom rather than deny the Truth for whose sake the Rib and Baha'u'llah drained the cup of sacrifice. 

 'In other lands, such as those in Western Europe, the faithful believers have to struggle to convey the message in the face of widespread indifference, materialistic selfsatisfaction, cynicism  and moral degradation. 

 These friends, however, still have freedom to teach the Faith in their homelands, and in spite of the discouraging  meagreness of outward results they continue to proclaim the Message of Baha'u'llah  to their fellow citizens, to raise high the reputation of the Cause in the public eye, to acquaint leaders of thought and those in authority with its true tenets, and to spare no effort to seek out those receptive souls in every town and village who will respond to the divine summons and devote theif lives to its seivice. 

 'In many lands, however, there is an eager receptivity for the teachings of the Faith. The challenge for the Baha'is is to provide these thousands of seeking souls, as swiftly as possible, with the spiritual food that they crave, to enlist them under the banner of Baha'u'llah, to nurture them in the way of life He has revealed, and to guide them to elect Local Spiritual Assemblies which, as they begin to function strongly, will unite the friends in firmly consolidated Baha'i communities and become beacons of guidance and havens of refuge to mankind. 

 'Faced by such a combination of danger and opportunity, the Baha'is, confident in the ultimate triumph of God's purpose for mankind, raise their eyes to the goals of a new Seven Year 

Plan.                     

 'In the Holy Land the strengthening of the World Centre and the augmentation of its worldwide influence must continue: The Seat of the Universal House of Justice will be completed and designs will, be adopted for the remaining three buildings of the World Administrative Centre of the Faith. 
The Institution of the    

International Teaching Centre

 will be developed and its functions expanded. 

 This will require an increase in its membership and the assumption by it and by the Continental 

Boards of Counsellors    

 of wider functions in the stimulation on an international scale of the propagation and consolidation of the Faith, and in the promotion of the spiritual, intellectual and community aspects of Baha'i life. 

 •      The House of 'Abdu'116h PishA in 'Akka will be opened to pilgrimage. 

 •      Work will be continued on the collation and classification of the Sacred Texts and a series of compilations gleaned and translated from the writings of the Faith will be sent out to the Baha'i world to help in deepening the friends in their understanding of the fundamentals of the Faith, enriching their spiritual lives, and reinforcing their efforts to teach the 

Cause.                    
•      The ties binding the Baha

International Community   

 to the United Nations will be further developed. 

 •      Continued efforts will be made to protect the Faith from opposition and to emancipate  it from the fetters of persecution. 

         'Each National Spiritual  

 Assembly has been given goals for these first two years of the Plan, designed to continue the process of expansion, to consolidate the victories won, and to attain, where circumstances permit, any goals that may have had to remain unaccomplished at the end of the Five Year Plan. During these first two years we shall be examining, with the 

Continental Boards of Counsellors

 and National Spiritual Assemblies,  the conditions and possibilities in each country, and shall be considering in detail ihe capacities and needs of each of the rapidly differentiating national Baha'i communities before formulating the futtlier goals towards


<p84>
84                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  which each community is to work following the opening phase of the 

Plan.                       

 'Throughout the world the Seven Year Plan must witness the attainment of the following objectives: 

•      The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar

 of Samoa is to be completed and progress will be made in the construction of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in 

India.                      
•      Nineteen new National
Spiritual Assemblies       

 are to be brought into being: eight in Africa, those of Angola, Bophuthatswana, the Cape Verde Islands, Gabon, Mali, Mozambique,  Namibia and Transkei; eight in the Americas, those of Bermuda, Dominica,  French Guiana, Grenada, the Leeward Islands, Martinique, St. Lucia and St. Vincent;  and three in the Pacific, those of the Cook Islands, Tuvalu and the West Caroline 

Islands. Those National     
Spiritual Assemblies       

 which have had to be dissolved will, circumstances permitting, be reestablished. 

•      The Message of Baha'u'llah

 must be taken to territories and islands which are as yet unopened to His 

Faith.                      

 •      The teaching work, both that organized by institutions of the Faith and that which is the fruit of individual initiative, must be actively carried forward so that there will be growing numbers of believers, leading more countries to the stage of entry by troops and ultimately to mass conversion. 

 •      This teaching work must include prompt, thorough and continuing consolidation so that all victories will be safeguarded, the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies will be increased and the foundations of the Cause reinforced. 

 . The interchange of pioneers and travelling teachers, which contributes so importantly to the unity of the Baha'i world and to a true understanding of the oneness of mankind, must continue, especially between neighbouring lands. 

 At the same time, each natiOnal Baha'i community must aspire to a rapid achievement of self-sufficiency in carrying out its vital activities, thus acquiring  the capacity to continue to function and grow even if outside help is cut off. 

 •      Especially in finance is the attainment of independence by national Baha'i communities urgent. Already the persecutions in IrAn have deprived the believers in that country of the bounty of contributing to the international funds of the Faith, of which they have been a major source. Economic disruption  in other countries threatens further diminution of financial resources. 

 We therefore  appeal to the friends everywhere to exercise the utmost economy in the use of funds and to make those sacrifices in their personal lives which will enable them to contribute their share, according to their means, to the local, national, continental and international funds of the Faith. 

 For the prompt achievement of all the goals and the healthy growth of Baha'i community  Life National Spiritual Assemblies must pay particular attention to the efficient functioning, in the true spirit of the Faith, of their national committees and other auxiliary  institutions, and, in consultation with the Continental Boards of Counsellors, must conceive and implement programmes that will guide and reinforce the efforts of the friends in the path of service. 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 must promote  wise and dignified approaches to people prominent in all areas of human endeavour, acquainting them with the nature of the Baha'i community and the basic tenets of the Faith, and winning their esteem and friendship. 

 At the heart of all activities, the spiritual, intellectual and community life of the believers  must be developed and fostered, requiring: the prosecution with increased vigour of the development of Local Spiritual Assemblies so that they may exercise their beneficial influence and guidance on the life of Baha'i communities; the nurturing of a deeper understanding of Baha'i family life; the Baha'i education of children, including the holding of regular Baha'i classes and, where necessary, the establishment of tutorial  schools for the provision of elementary education; the encouragement of Baha youth in study and service; and the encouragement of Baha women to exercise to the full their privileges and re~ponsi-bilities in the work of the community — may they befittingly bear witness to the memory of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the immortal heroine of the Baha'i Dispensation, as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of her passing.

INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                 85

  'As lawlesshess spreads in the world, as governments rise and fall, as rival groups and feuding peoples struggle, each for its own advantage, the plight of the oppressed and the deprived wrings the heart of every true Baha'i, tempting him to cry out in protest or to arise in wrath at the perpetrators of injustice. 

 For this is a time of testing which calls to mind Baha'u'llah's words 0 concourse of the heedless! 

 I swear by God! The promised day is come, the day when tormenting trials will have surged above your heads, and beneath your feet, saying: "Taste ye what your hands have wrought!" 

 'Now is the time when every follower of Baha'u'llah must cling fast to the Covenant of God, resist every temptation to become embroiled  in the conflicts of the world, and remember that he is the holder of a precious trust, the Message of God which, alone, can banish injustice from the world and cure the ills afflicting the body and spirit of man. We are the bearers of the Word of God in this day and, however dark the immediate horizons, we must go forward rejoicing in the knowledge  that the work we are privileged to perform is God's work and will bring to birth a world whose splendour will outshine our brightest visions and surpass our highest hopes.' 
                           
   Each National Spiritual    

 Assembly received a separate message setting forth the details of its respective goals. A summary of the progress  made towards fulfilling these, as well as World Centre goals, is set out on the following pages. 

  The Seat of the Universal House of Justice on Mount Carmel. Excavation of the site commenced in June 1975. The building was occupied by the House of Justice in January 1983.

          2. THE SEVEN YEAR INTERNATIONAL
              TEACHING PLAN 19791986
              PROGRESS TO RIpVAN 1983

  THE fifth International Convention falling just after the midpoint of the Seven Year Plan was an appropriate time for reporting on the progress toward achievement of the goals of the Plan both at the World Centre and throughout the Baha'i world. The current Plan has been the most detailed in the number and type of goals assigned to the Baha'i communities. The increased amount of data collected at the World Centre in monitoring the progress of the Plan attests, in itself, to the increased activity in the Baha'i world. 

 The following survey has been adapted from that prepared for use of delegates to the International Convention and has been supplemented with information which gives, in broad outline, an accurate picture of progress at Ridvan 1983. 

                A. THE WORLD CENTRE

  1.  Completion of the Construction of the Seat of the Universal 

House of Justice           

 By the summer of 1982 the building was very near completion, the final stages having been delayed by a number of factors beyond the control of the World Centre. 

 It was therefore possible to inaugurate the use of the permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice in a fortuitously appropriate manner through the holding of a seminar on the occasion of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest Holy 

Leaf.                      

 Subsequently the meetings for all Holy Days which are observed in Haifa have taken place in the Seat, and each group of pilgrims has been received there by the Universal House of Justice. 

 Work on the final stages of the preparation of the building for occupation, and on the landscaping of the surrounding area, continued  through the autumn and into the winter, and during the last two weeks of January 1983 the Universal House of Justice and a number of its departments moved their offices to the seat. 
                           
2.  Designs for Three Additional

 Buildings on the Arc the Arc on Mount Carmel has been given by the 

Universal House of Justice 
to Mr. Husayn Am6nat.      

 As a first step, the House of Justice has requested Mr. Am6nat to prepare three general presentations: one with the levels of the land as they are now — that is to say, with the southeastern end of the Arc at a level considerably lower than the northwestern end; another with the levels raised so that the Arc and the gardens within it are exactly symmetrical, the southeastern end being raised to the same height as the northwestern; and a third with oniy an intermediate adjustment  of the levels. 

 Studies are also proceeding on the functions of the three buildings (the Centre for the Study of the Texts, the International Teaching Centre and the 

International Baha'i       

 Library), in order to judge the dimensions and placement  of the structures, and their interrelationships  both with one another and with the existing edifices of the International Archives and the Universal 

House of Justice.          

  3.  Development of the International 

Teaching Centre            

  The task of preparing plans for the three One of the goals of the Seven Year Plan for remaining buildings which are to stand around the World Centre was stated as follows:


<p87>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                 87

  'The Institution of the 

International Teaching   

 Centre will be developed and its functions expanded. 

 This will require an increase in its membership and the assumption by it and by the Continental 

Boards of Counsellors    

 of wider functions in the stimulation on an international scale of the propagation and consolidation of the Faith, and in the promotion of the spiritual, intellectual and community aspects of Baha'i life.' 

  During the two-year opening phase of the Plan a number of important steps were taken in pursuance of this goal. 

  — The membership of the 

International Teaching    

 Centre was increased with the appointment by the Universal House of Justice of Miss Anneliese Bopp as a Counsellor member of the nucleus of the Teaching Centre in the 

Holy Land.                
    — The foundations of the   

Boards of Counsel-lots    

 were greatly broadened by the consolidation of thirteen Boards into five, thus widening the scope of the activities of each Board to include an entire continent. 

 — A further significant step in the development of the Boards of Counsellors was the setting of a specific term of office for the Counsellors in the continents, as was envisioned  in the original appointments. 

 This term has now been set for five-year periods beginning on the Day of the Covenant, 

26 November 1980.         

 — Steps were taken by the House of Justice and the 

International Teaching    

 Centre to strengthen the ties between the Counsellors, the 

Continental Pioneer Committees

 and the National Assemblies with a view to achieving closer collaboration between these institutions in the selection and utilization of both pioneers and travel-teachers. 

 — Exten~ive consultations were held between the House of Justice and the International Teaching Centre regarding appropriate means of opening the way in the next phase of the Plan for the Teaching Centre and the Boards of Counsellors to have a greater degree of participation in the development and financing  of special teaching projects and in the provision of Baha'i literature. The measures taken have resulted in a much wider dissemination  of Baha'i books, pamphlets and other materials for teaching and deepening, in accordance with the particular requirements of the various national communities.

<p88>
88                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  — In the wider field of promotion of the spiritual, intellectual and social life of the Baha'i community, the Counsellors have been encouraged by the 

International Teaching Centre

 to become increasingly aware of the more spiritual aspects of their functions. 

 In some continents plans are being developed by the Counsellors, together with the National Spiritual Assemblies in the area, to deepen the friends in various aspects of the Baha teachings, especially on the basis of the compilations sent out by the Universal 

House of Justice.          
                           
4.  Continued Strengthening

 of the Relationship  between the Baha'i International Community  and the United 

Nations                    

  In its consultative status with the United Nations 

Economic and Social Council
(ECO-SOC)  and the United  

Nations Children s Fund    

 (UNICEF), as well as in its association with the United Nations Environment Programme  (UNEP) and the UN Department of Public Information (DPI), the 

Baha'i International      

 Community, through its accredited representatives at the United Nations, has continued to find many opportunities to explain  how the Baha'i teachings, principles and laws, and the spiritual and moral answers provided by the Baha'i Faith, are essential to achieve the goals of world peace, universal human rights and the full development of all peoples sought by the United Nations Charter. 
More than ever, the Baha'i 

International  Community  

 has been able to point to the way of Life evolving in Baha'i communities as an embodiment of the Baha teachings. It did this most dramatically, for instance, during the International Year of the Child (1979), when Baha'i communities around the world sponsored programmes and activities to promote the wellbeing of children. 

 Also, as national and local Baha institutions have begun to sponsor programmes in literacy and rural development — through tutorial  schools and radio stations, for instance — to assist in the development of Baha'i communities and society as a whole, it has become possible for the Baha'i International Community, in its statements and reports to the UN, to give further evidence of the growth of the Baha'i world community. 

 Cooperation with the UN took another step forward with the establishment in July 1981 of a European branch office in Geneva, and the appointment of a full-time representative, and, shortly afterwards, an alternate. Also since 

1980 the Baha International Community

 has had a representative and an alternate with the Vienna International Centre (VJC) — the new UN branch headquarters  in Vienna, Austria, where the activities of the Centre for Social and Humanitarian Affairs are now located. 

 Activities among the nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) associated with the United Nations also continued. The Baha'i International Community has long participated in numerous NGO committees based in New York and Geneva (and now, too, in Vienna) and has helped in planning and chairing a number of activities, such as symposia,  luncheons, etc. Its representatives now serve as chairmen of the NGO Committee on UNICEF and of the NGO 

Committee on Human Rights  

 (New York), and as vice-chairmen of the DPIINGO Executive Corn-inittee  and of the Committee on the UN Decade for Women. 

  Besides encouraging National
Spiritual Assemblies      

 to establish and foster a relationship with the UN offices in their countries, sponsoring  or cosponsoring activities in observance of UN days and years and other events, the Baha 

International Community    

 has, since Ridvan 1979, taken part in twenty United Nations world conferences, congresses and seminars, and attended sixty-four sessions of UN bodies concerned with a broad range of issues: human rights, social development, the advancement of women, the environment, human settlements, children, disabled persons, the ageing, drug abuse, science and technology, disarmament and peace, outer space, crime prevention, population, youth, the law of the sea and the world food problem. 

 In this extensive cooperation with the UN, the Baha'i 

International Community    

 has presented  information, submitted statements, and published brochures — forty-six items in all —  expressing the Baha'i point of view on a number of these subjects. 
For the first time the     

Baha'i International       

 Community was invited to address the UN General Assembly, during its Second 

Special Session Devoted    

 to Disarmament. It continued to participate in

Economic and Social Council

 and many of its function~i1 commissions,  committees and associated bodies, such as the Commission on Human Rights and its SubCommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities; the Commission on the Status of Women; the Commission for Social Development; the Commission on Narcotic Drugs; and others.

  As the persecution of the Baha community in IrAn intensified, the 

Baha'i International Community

 helped to coordinate international efforts — initiated before the beginning of the Seven Year Plan — to bring their plight to the attention of the States Members of the United Nations, the UN Secretariat and non-govern-mental  organizations working with the UN (a detailed report of these activities appears on pages 414 to 425). 

 The persecution of the Baha'is in Iran, which constitutes a gross violation of their fundamental human rights, is clearly in con


<p90>
90                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  travention of the standards of religious freedom set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, more recently, the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. 

 The plight of the Baha'is has struck a chord of deep concern and sympathy on the part of UN representatives and officials, who have demonstrated a warm willingness to initiate and press for action to remedy the situation. 

   The Baha'i International    

 Community has prepared a number of publications concerning the persecutions in IrAn, which have been widely distributed at the United Nations and also made available to National 

Spiritual Assemblies.      

 The most important of these publications were 

The Baha'is in Irdn:       

 A Report on the Persecution of a Religious Minority (published in 1981, updated and reissued in 1982) and a formal 'Statement in Rebuttal' of various false and malicious charges propagated against the Baha'i Faith at the 37th 

(1982) UN General Assembly 
by the delegation of the   

Islamic Republic of IrAn.  

 The activities of the Baha'i International Community — which included the presentation of numerous oral and written statements to appropriate human rights organs of the United Nations — have resulted in or contributed to (a) d~marches by governments to the Secretary-General of the United Nations; (b) dtmarches by a total of 17 governments to the Iranian government in Tihr6n: (c) debates and resolutions by the 

UN Commission on Human Rights

 and its SubCommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, in which attention was specifically drawn to the religious nature of the persecution, and in which the Secretary-General was given a mandate to intervene with the Iranian government  on behalf of the Baha'is; (d) statements by sixteen governments during debates on human rights at the 1981 and 1982 sessions of the UN General 

Assembly; (e) a 1981       

 intervention  with the Iranian government by the UN Working Group on 

Enforced or Involuntary   

 Disappearances; (f) discussions of the situation by the 

UN Human Rights Committee 

 in July 1982, when it reviewed with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Ir6n the question of whether Iran was observing and implementing the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (to which it is a party); (g) similar discussions by the Committee on the 

Elimina-don  of Racial     
Discrimination in March    

 1983, when it reviewed with Iranian representatives the status of minority groups in Irgn. 
                           
5. Emancipation and Protection

 of the Faith Algeria and the Congo There has been no appreciable change in the condition of the Faith in these two countries and the activities of the Faith continue  to be banned in both of them. However, in the Congo, in response to applications made by several religious organizations, including  the Baha'i community, the Supreme Court is considering conferring general freedom  of religion in the country. Once the decree is confirmed, the way will open for the Faith in the Congo. 
                           
Egypt                      

 The friends here continue to suffer from the disability of lack of recognition of their institutions. 

 Several attempts to obtain protection of the civil rights of the believers in Egypt have been made through the Baha'i International Community. It is hoped that these efforts will yield results in the near future.

 Although the administrative institutions of the Faith are still not officially permitted to function, the friends engage informally in Baha'i activities, and continue to teach on an individual basis. 

 Small Baha'i gatherings are being held in various parts of the country to deepen the friends and to lift their spirits. There are two training centres (hostels or Ashrams) in Padang operated by the Baha'is, at which twenty-eight students, mostly from Mentawei, are housed; and a third centre was completed in July 1982, which now boards eight boys ranging in age from eight to ten. The children are trained from the beginning to be responsible for their own school expenses by selling handicrafts, etc., and many of the graduates travel-teach, visit the friends in remote areas, and attend conferences with their own funds. 

 Women's classes are being held regularly, where they are taught Baha'i prayers and the basic teachings of the Faith; and conferences, summer schools and other

 They participated in a conference at which fifty-five Baha from nineteen localities  gathered together. 

 Baha'i literature in various Indonesian languages is being translated, produced and distributed throughout the country in increasing  quantities.

 This has been a tragic period for the Baha'is of fran. Persecutions have steadily intensified; the. 

 Hoiy House of the Mb was totally demolished; the National Hazfratu'1-Quds, all local Ha?fratu'L-Qnds, and other Baha properties were either confiscated or destroyed; Baha'i cemeteries were seized and graves desecrated; the Nawnah6lAn and Uman6 Companies  were confiscated, and the Baha Hospital and Home for the Aged were taken over by the Revolutionary authorities; one hundred and eighteen Baha'is have been martyred; fourteen were kidnapped, their fate still unknown;  a large number were imprisoned; hundreds were forced to flee from their homes, which were either confiscated or destroyed; shops and other properties of many of the friends were seized and/or set afire; hundreds were dismissed from their jobs, many of whom had their pensions cancelled; and Baha'i students were expelled from schools and universities. 

 The Universal House of Justice called upon the United Nations office of the Baha'i International 

Community and National     
Spiritual  Assemblies     

 in most of the world to take measures to help alleviate the suffering of the friends in fran. 

 As a result of such efforts, many resolutions were adopted by a number of governments and by United Nations and independent organizations protesting against the atrocities meted out to the Iranian Baha and calling upon the authorities in Jrtn to stop the injustices being perpetrated against these innocent victims. 

 The sufferings of our Persian coworkers, however, have resulted in an unprecedented volume of publicity and proclamation for the Faith and have provided an opportunity for the Baha'is to familiarize prominent people and those in authority with the verities of the Cause. 

 These victorious achievements have made it easier for the valiant heroes in the Cradle of the Faith to bear the burden of their sufferings and have prompted them to thank Baha'u'llah for being chosen once again to be effective instruments for the promotion of 

His glorious Cause.

 to Iranian Representative in Helsinki This is obviously not an exhaustive report of actions taken on an international scale, but it provides a glimpse of the extensive support of those in authority and prominent people as a result of the dedicated efforts of Baha'i I communities. 

     Many National Spiritual   

 Assemblies have contacted officials of their governments appealing  to them for assistance in providing travel documents to those Iranian Baha'is who have been unable to renew their passports, in allowing them to remain in their country even though their passports or visas have expired, in issuing work permits, and in waiving the tuition fees of students whose source of income has been cut off. 

         The Australian Government 

 has established a special humanitarian immigration progranne for stranded Iranian Baha'is, and Canadian authorities have set up a project resulting in the successful transfer and settlement of hundreds of the Persian friends. 

 Both of these programmes, which have definite criteria for acceptance of Iranian Baha'is, have been established as a result of the persistent efforts of the friends in these countries. 

 There are many Iranian believers who have applied for resettlement in another country and 1 A more complete survey can be found under 'Detailed Summary of Actions taken by the Baha International Community, National and Local Baha'i Institutions, Governments, non-Bah&f 

Organizations and Prominent

 People in Connection with the Persecution of the 

Baha'is

 are waiting for their applications to be processed, and a large number of others not eligible for such programmes, who are being helped financially in hardship cases by the Baha'i Persian Relief Fund, or by the United Nations High Commissioner for 

Refugees.                 

  'Irdq So far as can be ascertained, there are no Baha'is in prison in 'Lr~q at this time; but during the last few years, although the prisoners  were released from custody, more were arrested and imprisoned and these, too, were later released. 

 This pattern of arrest and release was repeated several times. 
                          
Kampuchea (Cambodia)      

 Baha activities have been suspended and there is no contact with the friends in Kampu-chea. 

 Refugees from that country, however, are being approached by the Baha'is in Thailand and other countries and are given Baha literature in Khmer. 
                          
Laos                      
   The National Spiritual    

 Assembly of Laos was elected after a lapse of six years, and efforts are now under way to recover lost Local Assemblies and reactivate the believers. 

 The first formal meeting held at the Centre built on the Temple site took place in January 1982, and was attended by local officials who were very receptive to the Cause. 

 A number of National Assemblies have set up programmes to contact Laotian Baha refugees and to assist them in their re-absorp-tion  into the community. 
                          
Vietnam                   
    The Baha'is in Vietnam   

 have been forbidden to meet and to practise their religion since 1978. 

 All Baha'i Centres throughout the country have been either closed or confiscated by the authorities. When the National Hazi-ratu'1-Quds in Ho Clii Minh City was seized, two members of the National Assembly who were there at the time were summarily arrested and sent to 'reeducation' camps. One of them was released early in 1982 because of ill health, but the other is still in detention and all efforts to secure his release have so far been unsuccessful. 

 A Baha'i from Switzerland visited the friends in Vietnam in 1980 and found them to be steadfast and strong in the


<p97>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                 97

  Faith. Appeals have been made by the Baha International Community, a number of governments  and independent agencies to free the Baha'i prisoners and to grant members of the Baha'i community the religious freedom guaranteed in the Constitution of Vietnam. 

 Three of the friends in Vietnam recently approached the authorities requesting permission  for the Baha'is to meet together for prayers and other spiritual gatherings, and have asked for the return of their National Hazfratu'1-Quds for this purpose. It is not known whether there has been a response to their application. 

 A number of Baha'i communities have undertaken projects to contact Vietnamese refugees residing in their countries, to distribute  literature to them, and to meet with them for teaching and deepening purposes. 

 Some of the friends are regularly sending parcels of medicines, clothes and other necessities to the friends in Vietnam, and the National Spiritual Assemblies of Australia, Denmark, 

France, Norway and Sweden  

 have been called upon by the House of Justice to participate in this programme. 
                           
6.  Publication of Compilation
Commemorating  the Passing
of the Greatest Holy       

Leaf                       

  The preparation and publication of a compilation  of letters to the Greatest Holy Leaf, of statements about her by Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha and the beloved Guardian, and of her own letters was completed in 1982 in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of her passing. The Universal House of Justice appointed its Research Department to prepare the compilation, entitled Baha'i Khdnum, the Greatest Holy Leaf, and Mrs. Marzieh Gail and a committee at the World Centre were responsible for new translations included in this publication. 
                           
7.  Collation and Classification

 of the Sacred Texts Work has continued on the collation and classification of the Sacred Texts. 

 The original Publications of the Baha'i World Centre 1979 — 1983: softcover editions of Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Selections from the Writings of the BTh, and Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha; The Baha'i World, vol. XVII (1976 — 1979); and Baha'i KlPnum, the Greatest Holy Leaf.


<p98>

Tablets of Baha'u'llah    

 and 'Abdu'l-Baha and the original Letters of Shoghi Effendi now housed at the World Centre number approximately  15,000. 

 Authenticated copies of Tablets  and letters available at the World Centre for which no originals have yet been received include some 46,000 items. Of these originals and copies, approximately 15,000 are Tablets of Baha'u'llah, nearly 27,000 are Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha and over 17,500 are letters of Shoghi Effendi, altogether totalling more than 60,000 documents. 

 These documents have been studied and important passages from them extracted and classified. 

 Further, compilations have been gleaned from this collection, with translations made into English of selected passages where appropriate;  and these compilations were then sent out to the Baha'i world to help in deepening the friends in their understanding of the fundamentals of the Faith, enriching their spiritual lives and reinforcing their efforts  to teach the Cause. 

 During the period under review, eight major compilations were prepared and circulated to National Spiritual 

Assemblies. In October    

 1979, a set of three compilations of Writings of Baha'u'llah, the Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha  was provided as a sample to be used for translation into other languages. 

 Other compilations  included 'Extracts from the Baha'i Teachings Discouraging Divorce', 

January 1980; 'The Importance

 of Prayer, Meditation and the Devotional Attitude', 

March 1980; 'Attendance   

 of the Members of a Spiritual Assembly at its Meetings', October 

1980; 'The Power of Divine
Assistance', August 1981; 'Excellence
in All Things', November  

1981; 'Family Life', January

 1982; and 'The Importance of Deepening Our Knowledge and Understanding  of the Faith', January 1983. 

 Also, as requests for information and elucidation of passages from the various Sacred Texts and instructions of Shoghi Effendi were received by the Universal House of Justice from Baha'i institutions, scholars and other individuals, small compilations on specific subjects were prepared for their study. 

  8.  Restoration of the House of 'Abdu'II~h Piishii The task of restoring the House of 'Abdu' 11Th PAshA following the plan prepared by Mr. Ridv6nu'llAh Ashraf and approved by the Universal House of Justice, has been steadily pursued with the aim of having this priceless residence opened for pilgrimage by the end of the second phase of the Plan. Some idea of the extent of the work involved is gained from a brief recital of the accomplishments so far achieved. 

 — Three-quarters of the old and broken stones of the southeast and west faqades have been replaced with a local type of sandstone purchased from demolished buildings. 

 These stones were cut and fitted on the site. 

 — The plaster on the exterior walls of the central courtyard and the entrance corridor has been scraped off and these walls have been replastered with white cement and stone powder. 

 — Following the pattern of the originals, 260 doors and windows have been made and installed. 
     — The roof has been reconstructed.

 — Using 120 cubic metres of Katrina wood bought in Turkey, then shipped to Israel, the ceilings have been assembled and installed. 

 — Minor repairs have been made on the original floors of the main hail, one of the bedrooms,  and part of the room in which the Guardian was born. 

 All other floors have been resurfaced. 

 — All interior walls have been replastered and painted. 

 Red tiles purchased in France have been used in roof repair. Wiring and plumbing have been installed throughout the building. The main entrance door has been fabricated using steel pegs, as in the original. 

 — The facing of the south ~nd west walls surrounding the property, 2.5 metres thick and 4.5 metres high, has been replaced, an undertaking which called for approximately 700 cubic metres of stone and cement. 

 — Plans have been prepared to lay out the garden, repair the pool in the central yard and to re-floor the entrance. 

 — Wooden partitions for the areas upstairs, the main hail and the courtyards have been made and installed. 

 — The old bath at the foot of the staircase has been excavated, new walls have been built and a concrete roof installed. 

 — The upper rooms of the House were, at the request of the Universal House of Justice,

  exquisitely and carefully furnished in the style of the period by Abdu'l-Baha Rfihfyyih KhAnurn, and the delegates to the fifth International  Convention were the first pilgrims privileged to visit there. 

 — Every effort has been made to faithfully restore this historic building to its condition at the time when it was occupied by the Master and the Holy Family, All available documents and photographs have been closely studied, and the remains of the old building have been carefully traced. Of inestimable value to the project were the detailed personal memories of the late Mrs. Zeenat (Zinat) Bad6di, who was a member of the household in the days of 'Abdu'l-Baha aM. 
                           
9.  Extension and Beautification

 of the Gardens  

Baha                      

 The two gardens in the vicinity of the Collins gate, which were started in 1979, have been further developed, Many varieties of palms have been planted, as well as a number of flowering eucalyptus trees, the seeds of which were procured from Australia. 

 The most iinportant development was the acquisition in September 1980 of a strip of land 13,150 square metres in area, bordering the driveway from the western gate of the Baha'i property, which made it possible to complete the southwest quadrant gardens surrounding the Most Holy Shrine. 

 A new circular path, like that of the Haram-i-Aqdas, has been made and is bordered with cypress trees. Froin the western gate a new stretch of gardens has been Laid out, and another driveway has been constructed from the gate to the parking lot. 
                           
Mazra'ih                   

 Nearly 50,000 square metres of agricultural land adjacent to and north of the Mazra'ih property was purchased as a protection to the Mansion in this rapidly developing area.

 Five terraces behind the new Seat of the Universal House of Justice have been cultivated  and planted with thousands of plants and decorative shrubs. 

 Extensive pruning of all trees and shrubs was done in the Monument Gardens, and necessary repair work, including extensive rewiring,  was carried out. 

 Extensive work was done to beautify the garden bordering Hagefen Street at the foot of Mount Carmel, where Baha'u'llah pitched His tent. 

 The Baha Cemetery in Haifa was further developed.

 1,900 from 60 countries 1,450 from 43 countries 1,100 from 90 ethnic groups 2,400 from 45 countries 9,400 from 101 countries (all 5 continents) The spirit generated by these historic conferences stimulated and galvanized to greater action thousands more in a number of highly successful satellite conferences. 

 A summary of these developments follows: In EUROPE, all hearts rallied to respond to the call for spiritualization of the community and intensified personal teaching. A steady stream of messages from Counsellors, National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 and even local communities has been received at the World Centre recording the European acceptance of the challenges posed in Dublin. 

 Throughout LATIN AMERICA, stunning success  was achieved by the 'Trail of Light', a project surrounding the Quito conference in which ten indigenous North American Baha'is travelled and taught in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Ecuador, and ended their journey at the Montreal conference. 

 Performing  tribal dances for large audiences, inspiring and forging bonds of love with indigenous believers and achieving unprecedented publicity  for the Faith, they truly blazed a trail of light across the Am~ricas that augurs well for the fulfilment of the master's prophecy concerning  the destiny of American Indians in the spiritual awakening of their continent. Satellite conferences which shared the enthusiasm of Quito and also emphasized native participation  were held in Costa Rica, Bolivia, Belize, Paraguay, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Panama,  Suriname and French Guiana, the French Antilles, Bermuda, Barbados and 

Haiti.                     

  In AFRICA, five official satellite conferences, attended by Hand of the Cause of God William Sears, echoed the 'radiant love' of the Lagos conference with a 'unity, not of sitting together, but of hearts loving'. All the major ethnic groups in Southern Africa were represented  at the conferences in South Africa. Bophuthatswana, 

Transkei and Namibia.

Uganda.                    

 Nigeria's neighbours also took advantage of the activity in Lagos: Benin held five satellite conferences, attended by two hundred believers  from twenty-five Localities, and as a result of these and the efforts of visitors a twelve per cent growth in the Baha'i population was recorded, logo, Ghana, the Central African Republic and Senegal also held satellite conferences. 

 Several teaching projects were organized  in Nigeria for conference visitors• in one of these proj ects two hundred and fifty-five believers were enrolled and five Assemblies  formed in one week. 

  In NORTH AMERICA the third 

Continental Indigenous     

 Council on the Blood Reserve in Southern Alberta, one of two auxiliary conferences held in conjunction with the Montreal conference, was attended by four hundred and forty-six people representing sixty Indian tubes and ten countries. 

 The council was honoured by the presence of Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha R61~iyyih Kkinum and thrilled by the 'Trail of Light' members, who recounted their experiences with 

Indian Baha'is in Central  

 and South America. The seventh Annual Conference of the Association for Baha'i Studies was also held immediately preceding the Montreal conference. 

 More than six hundred and fifty Baha'is participated, discussing many topics, including Baha'i contributions to international development. 

 Seven satellite conferences were held in the Bahamas to share the inspiration of the Montreal conference. 

  In the PACIFIC teaching throughout the islands was undertaken by participants in the Canberra conference travelling to and from Australia. 

 A large contingent from Japan attended the conference, and some remained for a teaching trip in Australia, demonstrating their awareness of the importance of the spiritual axis described by the Guardian and emphasized by the Universal House of Justice in its message to the conference. Forty overseas  travel-teachers taught throughout Australia in the five months preceding and following  the conference. 

 Commemorations of the Passing of the Greatest 

Holy Leaf                  

 The Baha'i world was filled with awe and love as it became acquainted with, or learned more of, the life of the Greatest Holy Leaf during the commemorations in 1982 of the fiftieth anniversary of her passing. 

 The compilation  issued by the Universal House of Justice of Writings about her, the articles devoted to her Life which were published in nearly all Baha'i newsletters and the commemorative  meetings held on all five continents inspired the friends to greater dedication and service to the Cause in memory of this immortal heroine of the Baha'i Dispensation.  In addition to the five international conferences and their satellites which were dedicated to her memory, reports were received  of forty commemorative eVents, including  several teaching projects.

              B. WORLDWIDE OBJECTIVES

  1.  Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 

India                      

  At the beginning of the 

Seven Year Plan, the Universal

 House of Justice had approved the design of Mr. Farfburz Sabba, who was named architect for the House of Worship in India; the foundation stone had been laid by the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Riihfy-yih  KhAnum on 17 October 1977, and excavation of the area had begun. 

 On the first day of RidvTh 1980 a construction  contract was awarded to one of the largest and best-equipped companies in India. The first concrete was poured on 30 July 1980, and over a period of five months 2,300 cubic metres of concrete were used to make up the foundation. 

 In the next four months forty-five columns that support the podium slab at the basement level were poured. On 9 May 1981 concreting of the huge 5,000 square metre slab commenced and continued almost around the clock with a labour force of more than 400. The floor, or inner podium, was completed by the end of June, and the outer podium by mid-September  1981. 

 In preparation for the construction of the main entrance arches, 16 metric tons of temporary structural steel staging were fabricated to support each arch. 

 The actual construction of the arches, each containing 105 cubic metres of concrete, began in March of 1982, and the last arch was completed on 27 July. 

 On 3 April the foundation stone and a brick from the Siydh-Ch6l were embedded in the crown of the entrance arch which faces 'Akka. 

 The preparatory work for the very complicated construction of the external and internal parts of the dome to cover the central auditorium is now under way. Designing the temporary steel staging took two years of consultation and planning. More than 600 metric tons of structural steel have been used in the massive staging work erected on the floor of the Temple, supporting the inner leaves (petals) and the framework of the interior dome, which is to be umbrella-shaped and composed of nine thin hemispheric concrete shells intersecting each other and designed  to be the unopened petals of the Lotus blossom. 

 In March 1982 a contract was signed with a firm in Italy for 8,000 square metres of white Pentelikon marble for the cladding of the House of Worship. 

 Of the nine large pools to surround the Temple, two have been completed and filled with water to a depth of one metre, and work on a third pooi is in progress. Each pooi covers an area of approximately 500 square metres. 

 The two wings of the ancillary building flanking the main entrance steps of the House of Worship have been completed, providing about 750 square metres of space which will be used for administrative offices, reception rooms, a conference hail and an audiovisual centre, as well as accommodation for the resident manager.

104                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 An average of 500 workers, men and women, and including about ninety families, have done the bulk of the work, manually. They are provided with living facilities; and a nursery and primary school have been set up at the site to care for and educate the infants and children while their parents are at work. Morale is high, and, aware of the importance of their work, the labourers work with greater diligence and interest than at other projects. An example of this concerns women, who at the peak of the concreting work carried about 7½ metric tons of concrete in 25 kilogram headloads, walking a total of 22 kilometres back and forth between concrete mixers and forms. 

 It is gratifying to note the manner in which construction materials, in critically short supply,  have become available, and permission has been granted by various government and municipal departments; how suppliers of noncontrolled  materials have responded in giving those of a superior quality at rates often below market prices; and how construction has progressed accident-free. 

 The most outstanding achievement was the official exemption from import duty given by three Ministries of India for the marble. 

 Since it was the expressed desire of the Universal House of Justice for the Baha'is of India to contribute a share in construction costs, special Temple coupons of 1 to 100 rupees each were printed and distributed to Temple Fund representatives in each Baha'i community. 

 As a result of this effort and a generous outpouring of funds from the friends, twenty-two per cent of the total contributions received has come from 

India.                     

  2.  Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 

Samoa                      

  The purchase of the initial plot of Temple site land, situated at an elevation of 1,800 feet overlooking the city of Apia, was completed in November 1975. Since that time additional adjoining lots have been acquired to permit direct access to the Temple from the main road. 

     At Ridvan 1978 Mr. Husayn  

 AmAnat was appointed architect and in September of that year his design for the Temple was approved by the Universal 

House of Justice. On       
27 January 1979, His Highness
Malietoa Tanu              

 maffli II laid the foundation stone, and Ama-tu'1-BahA R6hfyyih KhAnum the representative of the House of Justice, participated by placing in a niche in the stone a small casket of Dust from the Sacred Shrine of Baha'u'llah.  A coloured sound motion picture entitled  'Blessed Is the Spot' recorded the ceremony and the conference which was held in Apia on the same weekend. 

 Soil testing and engineering studies followed and in June 1980 tenders for the construction of the House of Worship were let. A contract was signed with a New Zealand contractor, and a building permit was issued in August. Work on the site started in September. The first concrete was poured for the foundations on 18 December 1980 in the presence of the Malietoa. 

 The total height of the dome will be 33 metres, and by the end of 1982, 1,1 meires had already been completed. By March 1983 the dome formworks had been set up, and it was anticipated that the concreting of the dome would be completed by June. It will then be covered with white tiles.The completion date for the entire building is scheduled for Ridvan 1984. 

 The building of the Temple has already made an impact in Samoa, and it is expected to attract even more attention as it nears completion. 

  3.  First Dependency of the European Mashriqu'l-Adhkar 

         The National Spiritual     

 Assembly of the Baha of Germany has appointed Mr. Teuto Rocholl, the architect of the Temple in Lan-genhain,  to be the architect for the Home for the Aged which is to be the first dependency of that Temple. Mr. Rocholl has designed some thirty to forty Homes for the Aged in all parts of Germany. 

 After considering recommendations from the National Spiritual 

Assembly, the Universal   

 House of Justice has specified that the Baha Home for the Aged should be of the type in which each resident has a private room with a bath, and will receive daily care from the staff. It will have twenty-five beds and, at current prices, it is estimated that the cost of construction will be some DM. 3,500,000, excluding the cost of the site and of connections  to utilities.

  4.  New Territories and Islands Opened to the Faith The light of Baha'u'llah continues to spread to new territories and islands, as called for in the Seven Year Plan. More than fifteen islands have been opened to the Faith since the Plan began, and in order to establish what progress has been made in opening territories on the homefront, a major effort to determine the precise distribution of Baha'is across the globe has been undertaken by the Statistics Department. 

 In consultation with National Spiritual Assemblies, the major civil divisions inside each country (such as provinces or states) were ascertained, and these were incorporated into the reports sent by each community to the World Centre. The more detailed information that has been thus obtained  has revealed how close the followers  of Baha'u'llah have come to covering the earth with His Message: there are 2,315 civil areas within the homefronts of the 129 National Spiritual Assemblies which are able to report regularly; of these only 223 are not opened to the Faith. 

 The locations of these civil areas, both opened and unopened, are given in the following table.

Faith                     

  Although few specific goals of this type were assigned during the Seven Year Plan, progress on this vital front continues on many levels and in many forms. 

 Among the most important legal recognitions  of the independent status of the Faith was a constitutional amendment in Pakistan (8 April 1981), naming the Baha'i Faith specifically among the non-Muslim faiths of the country; this was preceded by a letter from the Ministry for Religious Affairs declaring the Faith a religious 'minority' among 'other non-Muslims'. 

 Other important general re cognition of the status of the Faith includes authorization in at least two countries for change of identity cards to show 'Baha'i' rather than 'Muslim' as the religion of the individual. 

 Other specific forms of recognition are outlined below. 
                          
A. National Spiritual     
Assembly Incorporation    

  During this period the 

Universal House of Justice

 has clarified the conditions under which this goal is considered achieved. 

 The minimum requirements are that the Assembly be accorded the status of an independent legal personality able to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, and to hold title to property


<p108>

both real and personal.

 Insofar as legally possible, the incorporation document should also embody the provisions of the Baha'i national or local constitution, as expressed in the model Declaration of Trust and ByLaws, and should not contain any provision contrary to Baha'i administrative principles. 

 Documents now on file at the World Centre confirm this achievement for a total of seventy National 

Spiritual Assemblies:  

 twenty-two in Africa, twenty-four in the Americas, seven in Asia, eight in Australasia and nine in Europe. Several other Assemblies, although not completing all the requirements above, have achieved all that is legally possible in their countries. 

 In several other instances, the information  now available at the World Centre is insufficient to determine whether or not all conditions established by the House of Justice have been met; inquiries into these cases are continuing. 

   During the Seven Year  

 Plan to date, the following national incorporation goals have been assigned. 

 The legal processes necessary for their fulfilment are often timeconsuming; the present status is as follows:

Local Assemblies;      

 of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, also by legislative act; of Cayenne in French Guiana; and of Macau. The Local 

Spiritual Assembly     

 of Addis Ababa has also recently been re-registered with the High Court of Ethiopia. 
                       
  B.  Recognition of Baha'i'
Marriage               

  During this period the Universal House of Justice has redefined what is meant by this goal, as follows: 

Recognition of Baha   

 marriage occurs when Baha'i authority to conduct and to certify marriages is legal; stated in another way, recognition is attained when a Baha'i or Baha, as representative(s) of the Faith, is/are empowered to conduct and certify a legally valid marriage, whether the Baha'i ceremony is legally sufficient or not. 

  (In some countries this is already possible under existing law, whether or not specific reference is made to the name of the Faith.) Records at the World Centre reflect such recognition in at least 45 countries, of which the following have been achieved during this 

Plan:

  C.  Recognition of Baha'i
Holy Days              

  The conditions under which this goal is considered fulfilled have recently been clarified  by the Universal House of Justice, as follows: We should consider the status of recognition of Baha Holy Days as achieved when a government department or office issues a document stating that on one or more of the Baha'i Holy Days Baha'i employees have the right to be excused from work, and/or Baha'i students are permitted to absent themselves from school,


<p109>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                109

  and/or institutions owned and entirely controlled by Baha'is may close on the nine specified days In some countries this has been achieved on a national basis, in others on a state or provincial or regional basis, and in others by local or district school boards or local governments. 

 In most instances the permission applies  to schoolchildren, although in a few cases government employees are entitled to be absent while schoolchildren are not. In other cases, students or employees have been permitted to absent themselves from school or work without penalty, although there is no official documentation of this right. Efforts continue toward clarification of this question in many countries for which World Centre records are still incomplete. 

 Specific achievements of the Seven Year Plan to date include the following:

  D.  Miscellaneous Recognition

  Less direct but equally interesting forms of recognition of the Faith are many and various, and are also increasing in number and frequency.  The following selected examples will give an idea of the variety of types of recQgnition achieved since Ridvan 1979. 
                          
Africa                    
         In Zaire, the Shaba State 

 Protocol Office has accepted that the Baha'i Faith be represented  during all the official meetings, as are representatives of other faiths; and in Liberia, the Ministry of Information has requested the designation of Baha'i representatives to the National 

Workshop on Religion.     
                          
The Americas              

 In Brazil, the Mayor of the city of Belo Horizonte has signed a decree designating an annual Baha'i week, to be included by the Municipal Cultural Secretary in the annual official calendar. 

In Canada, the Faith      

 has been granted nongovernmental organization status with the Canadian International Development  Agency, enabling cooperation and funding of many community service projects sponsored by Baha'i institutions worldwide. Several interesting assignments have been given to U.S. Baha'i representatives to the United Nations, and in 1982 the American Baha community was honoured by the United States Committee for UNICEF for service to the world's children. 
                          
Asia                      

 In India the government officials responsible for all public libraries in each of three slates have listed designated Baha'i books for purchase by all libraries under their jurisdiction,  while in Laos permission has been granted for the Baha'is to meet for Holy Days

    In Kiribati the Ministry  

 of Health and Community Affairs approached the Baha, requesting them to nominate a candidate for a Commonwealth Youth 

Study Fellowship.         
                          
Europe                    

 The very interesting recognition of the Faith in certain publicly-funded schools in Ireland has been outlined above. Also in Ireland, Bab6.'f children are excused from classes in Christian religious education and permitted instead to have instruction in their own Faith during those hours, and various exemptions governing such things as the form of letterheads have been granted to incorporated  Assemblies there. In the United 

Kingdom  three Baba'fs   

 now serve on the Religious Education Council, and two others on the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Faiths; and Baha'i viewpoints were included  in the 

1979 Standing Conference  

 on InterFaith Dialogue in Education. 

 In addition, numerous exemptions from taxes, rates, and customs duties have also been reported during this period, some representing  onetime exemptions on particular items or properties, and others representing general exemption.

8.  Radio Stations        

  The establishment of three new radio stations in South America is a goal of the Seven Year Plan and this goal is close to being won. 
                          
1.  'Radio Baha del Lago 

 Titicaca' with its transmitter and studio in Chucuito near Puno, Peru, began broadcasting on 26 November 1981; its associated teaching institute was completed for use soon thereafter,  going immediately into intensive service. 
At present the 1 kw.      

 medium-wave station is reported to be broadcasting ten hours per day inthe Spanish, Quechua and Aymar6 languages. 

 2.  In January 1983 a presidential decree allocated a medium-wave radio frequency to the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Bolivia for Caracollo, near Oruro, to become 

'Radio Baha'i of Bolivia'.

 Construction  of the new 1 kw. station and its associated teaching institute are scheduled for completion in January 1984 and for inauguration at Nawruz. A countrywide radio production and broadcasting programme  was under way in 1983 as prelude to opening of the station. 

3.  The National Spiritual

 Assembly of Chile was denied a frequency for technical reasons,  and is now seeking some resolution of their plan for a station at La Branza, near Temuco, in the country of the Mapuche Indians, where already it has acquired land and laid foundations for a station complex. 
4.  In December 1982 the  

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the United States received its construction permit for a 50 kw. 

 FM station, to be completed in early 1984 at the 

Louis Gregory Institute   
in Hemingway,

 are to reach and deepen the Baha'i population of eastern  and central South Carolina where there is the largest concentration of believers in the United

The first Baha station, 'Radio Baha'i of Ecuador', has recently received a far more favourable shortwave frequency, and has also been expanding its public service role in agriculture, health and general culture. It is also upgrading its medium wave transmission power to 3 kw. and broadening its Baha'i programming.

9.  Publishing Trusts      

  Goals of the Plan to date have included establishment of three new Publishing Trusts, in the Ivory Coast, Kenya and Nigeria; resumption of functioning of the 

Publishing Trust of Uganda;

 further development of the Publishing Trusts of Belgium, Fiji and Lebanon;  and development of regional publishing units in Zaire; and translation, publication and dissemination of literature, newsletters, correspondence courses, child education and audiovisual materials in regional languages through the State Teaching Committees of India. Significant progress has been made toward all these goals. 
                           
New Trusts                 

 Although the Ivory Coast, Kenya and Nigeria  are still functioning as national Publishing  Committees, various steps are under way to establish each as a Publishing Trust. 

 All three have produced their first publications, and it is reported that Kenya has obtained necessary equipment and that an operator has been hired and trained. 
                           
Resumption of Trust Activities

 in Uganda The first meeting of the reconstituted Publishing lishing Trust Committee took place in July 1981, although smallscale supply operations had resumed as early as November 1979. 

  Further Development of the Trusts of Belgium, Fiji and Lebanon The valuable services of all three of these Trusts, which are major sources for the Baha'i world of literature in French, in the languages of the islands of the Pacific and in Arabic, respectively, continue and are increasing in both quantity and quality. 
                           
Regional Publishing Activity

 in Zatre and India Decentralization of publishing activity has met with enthusiasm in both of these countries with polyglot populations, and a flow of literature in local languages from regional or state committees has already begun. Since the assignment of this goal at the beginning of the second phase, regional committees in Zaire have produced at least thirty titles in ten languages; and in India State Teaching Committees  have produced at least forty-one titles in twelve languages. 
                           
10. Translation and Publication
Achievements               
                           
  A.  General                

  Among the fundamental goals of the Seven Year Plan is that of providing every believer with portions of the Holy Texts in his or her language and to expand the range and availability  of literature in as many languages as possible. Understanding of the importance of this goal is reflected in the steadily increasing flow of reports from an ever greater number of countries, announcing new translations, publications, original materials and reprints in both native and world languages. 

 Of special interest in this regard is the number of reports from certain countries of translations made in the villages by local believers for their own use; some of these reports have reached the World Centre only some years after the achievement. 

 Also increasing is the number of reports reflecting cooperation between two or more National Assemblies in the translation and production of literature, and the reprinting of literature no longer available from the country


<p113>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                113

  of origin, in languages such as Lao, Vietnamese and Persian. 

 The total number of languages, dialects and scripts into which some Baha literature (although not necessarily Scripture) has been translated has now reached a minimum of 726, of which at least 568 have been published, or reproduced in some form and made available to believers and/or to the public. This number includes two invented languages (Esperanto and Interlingua), and Braille script for use by the blind in eight different languages, including  Japanese, Esperanto and Amharic. The range of literature available in each language varies from a single prayer or pamphlet to extensive libraries of titles; original, locally written materials are also appearing in an increasing number of languages. 

 B. Literature for Children

  Provision of literature specifically for children was a goal assigned to twelve National Assemblies, the first time that this particular emphasis has been so widely assigned. 

 Many additional communities have also felt the need for such materials for their children, as indicated by the figures in the table below, which includes colouring books and materials produced for children's classes, but not lesson plans. 

 In one case the lesson materials have been taped. 

 Titles originally produced in English are being widely translated, but many original items are also appearing in a variety of languages.  Especially noteworthy are the achievements of Mexico, where six titles in Spanish A selection of newsletters in various languages published specifically for children in the past five years. National communities represented above are: Nigeria (English), Greece. 

 (Greek), Italy (Italian), South & West Africa (Afrikaans/English), Iceland (Icelandic), Japan (Japanese), U.S.A. (English), Hawaii (English), Venezuela (Spanish), Swaziland (English/Swahili), Ethiopia (Tigrigna), Norway (Norwegian), Netherlands (Dutch), Jndia (English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu).

  Some of the published versions of Words of God, a compilation prepared at the World Centre from the Writings of the Central Figures of the Baha'i Faith. Shown above are editions in: Aymard, Quechua, Spanish, Luba, Afrikaans, Xhosa, Hindi, Gujarati, Swahili, English, German, French and Ponapean. 

  have been produced in two years; and the Netherlands, where at least eleven, and perhaps  more, of the twenty-six titles now listed for children have been produced during this Plan. In addition at least five magazines for children have begun publication during this period, one of which, Var qd, appears in five languages. 

 The total number of languages in which at least one item has been prepared specifically for children has now reached at least sixty-four, including German Braille. 
                           
  C.  Sacred Texts           

  To assist Assemblies in making the Sacred Word available to all believers, two compilations  of prayers and other selections from the Holy Texts were supplied to National Spiritual Assemblies by the Universal 

House of Justice. The      

 first of these, a compilation of extracts from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, the Mb and 'Abdu'l-Baha, was sent in October 1979; portions of that compilation have been translated into various languages for circulation  among the friends, and other such translations are in process. A smaller compilation  of short prayers and other brief selections  from the Writings was sent in September 1981 under the title Words of God. This second compilation has so far been pub. lished in thirty-seven editions in twenty-seven languages in twenty-one countries; an additional  twenty-three Languages in seventeen countries have been translated but not yet published, and at least twenty-two more are in process. Similar small compilations under other titles are also available in at least twenty-four languages, of which at least eighteen are different from those in which Words of God has so far appeared. 

In addition The Hidden     

 Words is also now available in more than ninety languages. 
                           
  D.  AudioVisual Materials 

  A special aspect of the objective, cited above, of enabling every believer to have some portion of the Sacred Text available in his native tongue, is the provision of such texts in taped or recorded form. Increasingly extensive goals have been assigned for provision of tape-recorded prayers and extracts from the Holy Texts, as well as for production of other audiovisual materials, for use both in deepening  new believers and in introducing the Faith to the public. 

        While certain Assemblies   

 have provided the believers with such materials in the past, goals


<p115>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA' f ACTIVITIES                               115

  concerning them have been extensively assigned for the first time during this Plan. 

 Production of such materials requires not oniy professional expertise, but also access to specialized facilities and equipment. These factqrs, when combined with the newness of the goals for many of the Assemblies to which they are now assigned, have resulted in many reports to the World Centre of projects not yet completed. However, Assemblies reporting particularly extensive achievements so far include the following: 

Africa                     

 THE CAMEROONS: taped prayers and introductions  to the Faith in Gbaya, Bamoun, Bulu, Ewondo and Duala, with others in process. 

 NIGERIA: taped prayers, Hidden Words, and songs in Hausa, Jgbo, Yoruba, English and liv; filmstrip commentary translated into Hausa. 

 SOUTHWEST AFRICA/NAMIBIA:     deepening materials in process in five local languages. 

 UPPER VOLTA: tapes in Ly616, Nankanse and Gourmantche. 
                           
The Americas               

 ARGENTINA: audiovisual materials for child education, as well as taped extracts and prayers in Mapuche, 

Mataco and Toba.           
     BELIZE: tapes in Island    

Carib (Garifuna), Kekchi   
and Mopan (Maya).          

 BOLIVIA: an extensive list of tapes and deepening materials in Quechua, AymarA and Spanish, including cassettes for children and radio tapes. 

 CANADA: films, videotapes, programming for cable television. 

 GUATEMALA: tapes in Cakchiquel and Main. 

 PANAMA: tapes in Guaymi and Cuna. 

 UNITED STATES: videotapes in Chinese and Persian; TV programmes in Chinese and Spanish; filmstrip commentaries translated into Chinese, Laotian and Spanish; radio tapes, radio series, programming for cable TV and widely distributed cassette deepening tapes in English. 

 VENEZUELA: radio tapes in Guajiro and Spanish. 
                           
Asia                       

 MALAYSIA: an extensive list of taped materials terials in Chinese, English, 

Tamil, Bidayuh and Iban    
languages.                 
                           
Australasia                

 CAROLINE ISLANDS: two and a half hours of deepening tapes in Ponapean, with other languages in process. 

 VANUATU: correspondence courses on tape being developed in Bislama and Lenakel. 
                           
Europe                     

 SPAIN: extensive taping programme including  thirty-six proclamation and teaching cassettes  for radio use. 

  In addition a special Committee for Service to the Blind, located in the United Kingdom, is a clearing house and production and distribution centre for materials both on tape and in Braille; and CIRBAL (Centro para 

Inter-camblo  Radiof6nico  

 Baha'i de Am6rica La-tina), among its other functions, serves as a clearing house for tapes, videotapes, script and other materials suitable for use via radio and television. 

  Several other Assemblies   

 have reported initial achievements on a lesser scale, and many projects in many languages are still in process. 
                           
  E.  Correspondence Courses 

  Correspondence courses were assigned as goals to thirty-one National Assemblies during the first phase, and were so successful that in the second phase this goal was reaffirmed  for twenty-six Assemblies and extended  to thirty-nine more, for a total of sixty-five. 

 Many Assemblies to which the goal was not specifically assigned also report correspondence courses in use. 

 One hundred and forty courses in thirty-four languages are reported in use for inquirers, for deepening new believers, for those desir-OHS  of more advanced study, for women, for children, for youth, for parents, for Local Spiritual Assembly members and for Auxiliary Board assistants. This is a field in which inter-Assembly cooperation has been especially fruitful; several Assemblies report that they are using course materials developed in other countries, sometimes in other parts of the world, whether in the original form or translated  or adapted. Especially noteworthy are


<p116>
116                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 reports from India, where courses are now available in ten languages; from Malaysia, which lists three courses in Chinese, two in Iban, one in Malay, two in Tamil and five in English, of which one is especially for children; and from Togo, which reports three series totalling fourteen courses, with others under development. 

 In some cases special types of courses were called for by the goals. For example, the following countries have been called upon to develop courses especially for children: (Africa) Nigeria, Senegal, 

Togo; (The Americas)      
Brazil, Chile; (Asia)      

 Malaysia. Of these, to date, Malaysia has reported a course for children developed in English, with additional lessons to be prepared in Malay. 
                           
11.  Efficient Functioning 

 of National Spiritual Assemblies  

     National Spiritual Assemblies

 have distinguished  themselves in their courageous and audacious defence of the Baha'is in fr~n; the attainment of financial self-sufficiency has been another heroic achievement. The efforts to foster an awareness among the friends of their responsibility for the growth of the Faith, to raise up self-supporting pioneers and travel-teachers, and other teaching initiatives described in a later section are further evidence of the growing independence of National Spiritual 

Assemblies.                
                           
  A.  Financial Self-Sufficiency

  Commendable efforts have been made by most National Assemblies to become increasingly  independent of the International Funds of the Faith, and a fair number have achieved total self-sufficiency. 
                           
12.   Public Relations     
                           
  A.  Cordial Relations      

  Astonishing success was achieved in the area of fostering cordial relations with prominent  people, especially through the Baha'is' efforts to enlist the help of their governments in alleviating the suffering of the Baha'is in fr6n. 

Seventy National Spiritual 

 Assemblies developed systematic programmes to promote cordial relations with authorities, and ninety-four  reported some activities. Baha'i dele gations in twenty-seven countries met with thirtyfive Heads of State or Government, and twenty-one National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 reported  making contact with all members ~f parliament or all the ministers of the government.  Large numbers of federal and provincial ministers, other authorities, and prominent individuals in eighty-three countries received Baha'i delegations or information about the Faith. 

 Appreciation of the Faith among the leaders of the world is growing, as is evidenced by a Prime Minister who advised his government to receive the Baha'is and listen to them, another government's request for Baha'i prayers to be read in a Cabinet meeting, and a UN official who remarked that wherever he was posted the Baha'is were always the first to welcome him and offer their assistance. 
                           
  B.  Use of Media           

  Proclamation of the Faith in the mass media has reached unprecedented levels as a result of the suffering of the Baha'is in lrhn. In the Seven Year Plan to date, publicity of the Faith has been reported by ninety-five Assemblies, including television coverage in fifty-three countries, radio coverage in eighty-four and press reports in eighty-two countries. 

 The opening years of the Seven Year Plan have also been characterized by a great initiative by Baha'i communities to exploit every available media opportunity. Baha'is in many countries have taught themselves to use the mass media in seminars and workshops, some of them conducted or assisted by media professionals who became interested in the Faith. At least ten Baha communities in Canada showed regular cable TV programmes during the first phase. In Norway the Baha'is were the first independent group to produce a radio programme after a new law allowed this, an accomplishment which in itself produced substantial publicity for their community and the Faith. In the United States a recorded telephone message of the most recent Baha'i news developments is used by local media representatives to write timely articles for their local papers; more than 1,500 have been published there during the second phase. 

 Regular radio programmes were reported by a number of National Assemblies: five in


<p117>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                117

  Africa, seventeen in the Americas, two in Asia, five in Australasia and one in Europe. 

One National Assembly     

 in Africa, five in the Americas and two in Europe reported regular television programmes. 

 The media have increasingly been used for the consolidation and spiritual enrichment of the Baha'i community as well. A new practice is the use of national radio and newspapers to remind the far-flung and inexperienced Baha'i communities to observe Holy Days and other events. As a result of vigorous efforts by the 

Baha'is, All-India Radio  

 now announces every Baha'i Holy Day and special events. Some communities broadcast morning and evening devotions; many use frequent short radio announcements for teaching. Regular Baha'i programmes on commercial or public radio, several of them in indigenous languages, are broadcast in thirty countries, and regular Baha television programmes in eight. 

 For more than ten consecutive years words of Baha'u'llah have been raised from the midmost heart of the ocean in weekly radio and television programmes in the Dutch Antilles, now under the jurisdiction of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Leeward Islands. 

 The weekly Baha'i programme on Radio Jamaica, now in its seventh year, attracts seventy-nine per cent of radio listeners,  according to the station authorities. 

 A report from the Central African Republic, where the Baha'is have aired a weekly radio progamme for ten years, shows the effectiveness  of these programmes. Baha'is marching in an Independence 

Day Parade under a Baha  

 banner were greeted by the crowd of 25,000 with the Baha'i radio show theme song, and shouts of 'La Foi Baha'i'; and as the Baha'is marched past the Presidential box, the President and 

Government Ministers      
gave them special applause.

 Baha'i utilization of radio in the Americas is being assisted by CIRBAL, the agency which provides information, training and a distribution  service for scripts and tapes for use principally in 

South and Central America 

 and the Caribbean. Radio training workshops have been held in four countries, and Puerto Rico holds two or three annually. 

 Many communities in Latin America have established their own recording facilities with the assistance of 

CIRBAL.                   
13.  Education1           
                          
  A.  Bahd'iEducation of Children

  The challenging goal of providing Baha'i education for every Baha child has received the devoted attention of believers around the world. Four hundred and thirty-seven institutes  for training children's teachers have been held by sixty-six 

National Spiritual Assemblies. Fourteen

 communities in the Americas now hold annual education seminars. Sixty National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 have reported developing new lesson plans for children during the Plan and the most recent reports indicate that thirty-three national communities have children's classes in over half of their 

Local Spiritual Assembly  
areas.                    

 A report from the Ivory Coast refers to classes in their fifth consecutive year, and describes villages where most children have memorized prayers, as well as a locality where all children, including non-Bah6'is, attend the Baha'i classes held in the school. Several communities provide Baha'i education during school periods set aside for religious instruction,  a trend which should increase as Baha'is succeed in familiarizing education authorities with the Faith. 

 One hundred and twenty-six children's schools, camps or conferences have been held during the first half of the Plan. At least fourteen commumties publish Baha'i children's magazines, and others produce children's pages in their national newsletters. 

 By Ridvan 1983 the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies holding children's classes on a regular basis was in excess of three thousand. 
                          
  B.  Tutorial Schools      

  In summarizing the present worldwide endeavour to establish tutorial schools (usu-ally  nonformal village schools, often with a single teacher), it is clear that records and reports are incomplete. Nevertheless, the schools are playing an increasing role in the development of the Faith in many areas. 

 At the outset of the Seven Year Plan the goal of encouraging the establishment of tutorial schools was given to 'thirty-three See The Development of Baha'i Schools during the Seven Year Plan', p. 207.

  national Spiritual Assemblies, nineteen of which were in Africa. At the opening of the second phase of the Plan, the number of National Assemblies with this goal was raised to forty-one, and thirteen of these were given specific numbers of schools to establish. 

 At the end of the first phase about eighty tutorial schools were reported to be in operation. 

 By the end of the second phase one hundred  and forty-three tutorial schools have been reported. 
In Asia these included:    

India fifty-two, Bangladesh

 eight, Philippines eight and Pakistan one. In Africa Zaire's primary school programme failed to produce the desired effects, hence educational centres have replaced them, and nineteen are now reported. Also in Africa the Cameroon Republic  has two tutorial schools, Central African

 In October 1982 a $1,900,000 reconstruction  of the Louhelen School near Davison, Michigan, was completed. This reopening of the school, which began with modest classes in 1931, is an important step in the evolution of Baha'i academic schools in the United States. The new facility is currently used for summer schools, institutes and conferences; eventually  it will become a year-round academic school. This development brings closer to fruition the prediction of the 

Guardian that Louhelen     

 had the potential to 'gradually develop into a true cultural and educational Baha'i centre'. 

  D. Subject Related to 

Universities and Schools1  

  The efforts to include the Baha'i Faith in the curricula of universities and schools are gaining momentum through several major achievements and the persistent efforts of many Baha communities around the world. One important accomplishment is the production  of a college textbook on the Faith in Canada, which will soon be published in 

English and French. The    

 publication in Britain of two secondary-level textbooks —  The Baha'i Faith and Eight Ma]or Religions in Britain, which contains an excellent Baha'i section — has assured the inclusion of the Faith in Religious Studies courses in the United Kingdom, and has given a great impetus to efforts in other parts of the world. In India the Baha'is have been requested to conduct moral education classes in the government schools of Orissa State. In Chile the National Spiritual Assembly is continuing to develop a curriculum  for teaching the Faith in government schools, following conditions set down by the Ministry of Education. In Iceland the Baha'is established cordial relations with the Course Director for Religious Studies for the Icelandic  schools system, and in Australia a proposed Baha'i curriculum was submitted to the South 

Australian State Schools   
Religious Studies Committee.

 Courses on or including the Baha'i Faith have been taught at several universities in Canada, the United States, Alaska and Hawaii  as well as in Kenya, Nigeria and some other countries. 

 The number of such courses will undoubtedly increase as a result of the vigorous teaching activities carried out in schools and universities during the Seven Year Plan. Among the many efforts all over the world the National Spiritual Assembly of Brazil prepared a letter to educators which Baha'i students distributed to their teachers during Education Month, and several corn-See articles beginning on p. 194: 'The Association for 

Baha'i Studies', 'Baha'i   
Scholarship in Australia'  

 and 'Baha'i Studies Seminars ~t the University of 

Lancaster'.

  munities including Puerto Rico conducted essay contests for students. A network of 257 Baha'i college clubs is in the forefront of teaching work in the United States, and the number of these clubs is increasing around the world. 

     The Association for Baha'i 
Studies, founded  by the  

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Canada during the Five Year Plan, has extended its activities to the 

United States, Australia   

 and Europe, and continues to develop  its ability to foster Baha'i scholarship and introduce the Faith into university courses. A West African Centre for Baha'i Studies formed in 1983 in Nigeria, has similar goals and great potential for attracting Africans to the Faith. 
                           
14.  Community Development 

  The development of Local 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 and the consolidation of local Baha'i communities have been at the heart of the Seven Year Plan. 

 Great efforts and remarkable progress have been made; the quality of local Baha life is changing perceptibly in all parts of the world. 

 Many endeavours have contributed to the successful achievement of this goal: spiritual enrichment activities; efforts  to strengthen Local Assemblies; the dramatic increase in activities for Baha'i families, women and youth; and the growing frequency and accessibility of summer/winter schools. 

     Almost all National Spiritual

 Assemblies, 114 in total, have reported nationally organized  community development activities; over 1,650 events attended by more than 37,000 believers have been held. 
                           
  A.  Spiritual Enrkhment    

 and Baha'i Way of Life A solid achievement of the Seven Year Plan has been the importance attached to, and efforts directed toward, the spiritual enrichment  of the believers. 

Sixty-six National Spiritual

 Assemblies adopted vigorous nationwide  programmes for this purpose. Most of them featured weekend or several-day institutes on specially designed programmes of study which were held in all parts of the country. The Covenant was the topic of many; others focused on prayer and study of the Writings; Ireland conducted a programme on The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, and in the United States two months of each year were designated study months, each community being provided with study materials, cassette tapes, etc. on the chosen subject. Many communities trained special teams to conduct the spiritual enrichment programmes. 

 The members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United Kingdom conducted twenty-five institutes on spiritual enrichment, and all those participating then led other institutes. Some African countries added an extra day to their 

District Conventions       

 or Regional Teaching Cohferences for a spiritual enrichment programme. 

 The life-giving words of the Manifestation of God, essential for spiritual growth, are becoming available to more members of the Baha'i community, not only through the translation and publication achievements described above, but also through a new emphasis  on effective distribution of Baha Scripture and encouragement of its use. Several  National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 have initiated  programmes to provide every believer with the Words of God compilation; others have printed the short obligatory prayer or other short passages on attractive posters and cards. Several communities are producing booklets containing selections of the Writings for morning and evening devotions. 

 Feast newsletters published by many communities include passages for daily reading. 

 In Luxembourg  these are personally delivered to each believer who does not attend the Feast. 

 The number of inspirational and deepening activities on the local level is also increasing; thirty-two national communities report local deepenings in over fifty per cent of their Local Spiritual 

Assembly areas. Dawn       

 prayers continue  in communities all over the world; in one, the friends from an entire province meet weekly to pray, deepen, and contribute to the Fund. Six National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 have reported regular prayer gatherings in more than forty per cent of their communities.

  reinforce the foundations of the Baha'i community. 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 are also assuming their proper role in directing Baha'i life; seventy National Spiritual Assemblies made efforts to have their 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 register births, and sixty-three provided guidance for Local Assemblies regarding  Baha'i marriages and funerals. Birth registers, Baha'i birth and marriage certificates  and booklets on the relevant Baha'i laws have been produced in many countries. 
                           
  C.  Family Life            

  A deeper understanding of Baha'i family life has been fostered by activities in many countries. 

Nineteen National Spiritual

 Assemblies  held institutes or seminars on this subject, and many communities have held deepenings using the Universal House of Justice compilation on Baha Family Life. Family prayers are being encouraged in a number of ways; Puerto Rico is providing a poster for families to have in their homes, and Canada has published a daybook with daily readings. 
                           
  D.  Women's Activities     

  Inspired by the example of the Greatest i-{oiy Leaf, the fiftieth anniversary of whose passing the friends have commemorated, Baha'i communities around the world made more intensive efforts to encourage the participation  of women in Baha'i activities and to attract greater numbers of women to the Faith. 

Seventy-seven National     
Spiritual Assemblies      

 reported women's activities that included two hundred and sixty-two conferences. 

 There were over one hundred and ten women's conferences in Africa, and in an ambitious programme in Malaysia over seven hundred and fifty women attended women's events. Twenty-four 

National Spiritual Assemblies 

 report women's teaching activities, including Chad, where one woman made a thirty-nine-day teaching trip, and later walked over 100 kilometres on a twenty-eight-day trip with another woman. 

 During the Plan several communities have begun to produce publications  for Baha women. 

 In some parts of the world Baha'i women meet locally for prayers, singing, craft work and instruction in nutrition and child care. In some developed countries, morning meetings are being held fQr teaching women who are at home. 
                           
  E.  Youth                  

  Goals to mobilize youth for participation in expansion and consolidation activities were assigned to many communities; fifty-eight held organized youth teaching projects. In several African countries and in Australia youth teaching projects are organized for every loffg school holiday, and sometimes the youth have travelled on foot. Zimbabwe has trained over one hundred teams of two youth each for consolidation; Tonga attributes its progress towards large-scale enrolment to youth teaching and consolidation teams. Youth are also holding children's classes, teaching in tutorial schools, conducting deepenings in villages and proclaiming the Faith through Baha'i sports teams. 

 Over five hundred and twenty-five youth conferences, schools and camps have been held by one hundred and two National Spiritual Assemblies during the Seven Year Plan thus far. 
                           
  F.  Summer/Winter Schools  

  A signal achievement of the Plan, and one that has contributed greatly to the consolidation of the community, has been a marked increase in the number of Baha'i summer and winter schools held each year. Almost twenty countries in Africa and about the same number in the Americas held their first Baha'i schools during this period. The number of National Spiritual Assemblies holding summer or winter schools more than doubled, rising from around fifty to one hundred and twenty-three. Furthermore, many communities  began regional schools and have also increased the number of schools held each year. Thirtyfive schools are now held annually  in Canada, and thirty-eight in the United States. 

 A new dynamism suffused many schools as a result of the directive that they should be held at low cost; all segments of the Baha'i community attended and a wonderful spirit of love and unity was generated as the participants  worked together cooking and doing other necessary chores. Many schools in

  cluded daily teaching among the local residents attracted by the example of the school. 

 Over 1,000 school sessions have been held worldwide, attended by over 95,000 believers and enquirers. 

 Their combined length was 4,391 days. 
                           
  6.  Newsletters and Periodicals

  The circulation of local, regional, national and international news is an important factor in binding together the Baha'i community as well as in increasing the believers' understanding of the scope and importance of the Faith they have embraced.While most national communities  and many local ones produce such newsletters, albeit sometimes sporadically, specific goals calling for prompt and regular dissemination of newsletters were assigned to Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana, India (where emphasis was placed on newsletters in the regional languages of the country) and Tonga; specific goals concerning magazines were also assigned to Germany and jointly to 

Australia and New Zealand. 

 The number and variety of newsletters currently produced by the Baha world is impressive. During the last year, current issues of 277 different periodicals and magazines  in forty-two languages reached the World Centre Library; there is no question that many others are produced, especially on local, district and regional levels, which do not reach the 

World Centre. Included     

 are national, regional and local newletters; newsletters  and magazines especially for children, for parents, for youth, for women, for teachers  of Baha'i children's classes; for native believers; for pioneers abroad; for Auxiliary Board members; for local treasurers or national treasurer's representatives; for public affairs and public information representatives; for Persian believers in Western countries; for believers active in Baha'i radio stations. 

 Other newsletters are produced by National Teaching  Committees, Committees for Spiritual Enrichment, Family Life Committees, 

Baha Education Committees 

 and university clubs. Many National Assemblies send regular newsletters  to 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 
for their Nineteen Day     

Feasts. The National       
Assembly of Southwest      

 Africa/Namibia produces regular newsletters in five languages; eleven or more regional newsletters appear in local languages in India; Malaysia produces a national newsletter in four languages and regional newsletters in three; Switzerland currently produces eight different periodicals in three different languages; dozens of other countries produce periodicals in two or more languages, some intended for worldwide circulation. Inter-nationally-circulated publications also include Glory magazine for youth, published in India Child's Way, published in English in the United States; and Varqd, a magazine for children published in India in English, Persian and Hindi and now developing editions also in five regional languages of India as well as French, German, 

Spanish and Portuguese.    

 Literary and scholarly publications intended for both Baha'i and nonBahA'i audiences include  The Green Door, privately produced in Belgium; Opinioni Baha'i, produced in Italy; La Pens& Baha'i, produced in Switzerland;  World Order, produced in the United States; and various publications of the Association for Baha Studies, headquartered in Canada.

  A.  Large-Scale Enrolments 
                           
         Thirty-four National Spiritual

 Assemblies have reported teaching projects designed to attract large numbers to the Faith, and the necessity of achieving entry by troops and preparing for mass enrolment is at the forefront  of the concerns and consultations of many communities. The most successful projects seem to be characterized by a high degree of motivation on the part of local participants; there has been a surge in the growth of the Faith in West Africa as friends returned from the Lagos Conference inspired to teach. Constant evaluation and attempts to improve the effectiveness of methods used are other hallmarks of highly successful projects, as is the presence of friends who are able to devote all their time to the project. One such example is the Yercaud Project in Tamil Nadu, India, dedicated to the memory of Mr. Amoz Gibson. All sixty-eight villages in the Yercaud tribal district have been opened, and in six everyone has become a Baha. More than one hundred and fifty entire families have accepted the Faith, 'and the project

  participants are training all the Local Spiritual Assemblies to hold local activities from the time they are elected. Asked to send a representative to sit on the platform at an important community meeting, the Baha'is were thanked for what they were doing in Yercaud and told, 'Till now religions came and trained the people to expect something, but the Baha'is are creating self confidence in the people's minds.' 

 While growth in the number of believers was moderate in most of the world, some countries are clearly moving towards the stage of entry by troops. During the first half of the Seven 

Year Plan the Baha'i      

 populations of Honduras and Dominica have quadrupled, eleven communities have more than doubled their Baha'i population and an additional ten have increased their Baha'i population by more than fifty per cent. 

 More than a one hundred per cent growth has been achieved in Burundi, Chad, Cyprus, Dominica, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, Ivory Coast and Mali, St. Lucia, Upper Volta and Vanuatu, and more than a fifty per cent growth in Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil, Guyana, Italy, Malawi, St. Vincent and Grenada,  Suriname and French Guiana, Transkei and 

Zimbabwe.                 

  B.  Growth in Numbers of 

Local SpiritualAs-semblies 

  The number of Local Spiritual Assemblies around the world has risen steadily, Led by Asia, where there was an eighteen per cent increase in the number of Local Assemblies, and Africa, where there was a thirteen per cent increase. During the first half of the Seven Year Plan, the total number of Local Spiritual Assemblies rose by fourteen per cent to 27,329. The growth of Local Spiritual Assemblies and Localities during the past thirty years is shown in the graph on page 82. 

  C.  Baha'is in the General

  The following percentages have been calculated using the numbers most recently reported and the most rdcent population statistics available to the Statistics Department.  Where no report of the number of believers was sent, the last available figure was used. Ten National Spiritual

 D. Individual Teaching    

  The recognition by each believer of his personal obligation to advance the interests of the Faith is an objective of the Seven Year Plan towards which the Baha world community  is moving with determination. One sign of this is the adoption of personal teaching goals by increasing numbers of believers;  encouragement of this action has been offered by Baha'i institutions on all continents. At least twenty-seven National Spiritual 

Assemblies in Africa      

 and nine in the Americas have published sample goals, distributed  personal goal forms or held special conferences on this subject. 
                          
 F. Extension Teaching Goals

  The great increase in the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies adopting and pursuing extension teaching goals is another indication of the maturing awareness among believers of their responsibility for the promulgation of the Faith. 

 At this time six National Spiritual Assemblies report adoption of extension teaching goals by one hundred per cent of their Local 

Spiritual Assemblies.

  ing teaching campaigns and informing the believers of the possible avenues of service available to them. One hundred and sixteen National Spiritual Assemblies held over 1,400 teaching conferences, attended by over 78,000 believers. 

 This represents an eighty-three per cent increase in the frequency of these meetings, which were held at the rate of two hundred and twenty per year during the Five Year Plan. 
                           
  G.  Self-supported Homefront
Pioneers and Travelling    
Teachers                   

  Self-supported homefront pioneering is one form of service that is increasingly suggested to the believers. 

 Homefront pioneers have been essential in winning every Plan since the first ones the Guardian gave to North America and Europe, and on those continents homefront pioneers continue to serve valiahtly in the most remote and difficult areas. In some parts of the world, however, self-supported homefront pioneering has been stressed for the first time during the Seven Year Plan. 

 Goals in this area have been given to sixty-one National 

Spiritual Assemblies.      

 Thus far reports have been received of at least forty-seven homefront pioneers in seventeen countries in Africa, of at least thirty-four in fourteen countries in Central and South America, of many in four countries in Asia and of at least eight in three countries in Australasia. 

 The number of these heroic servants of Baha'u'llah is expected to rise steadily, as many National Spiritual Assemblies are actively encouraging  self-supported homefront pioneer-lug. 

 Those among the younger Baha'i communities  which have taken upon themselves the burden of the development of the Faith in their countries and function without outside help exhibit a special exuberance and confidence.  In Tonga such teams continually support  seventy-eight communities. Peru, where sixty-two per cent of village Local Spiritual Assemblies have extension teaching goals, and Zambia, where effective consolidation is carried on without the help of pioneers, also offer examples of the successes which other communities can anticipate as they move towards the goal of self-sufficiency. 

 Many communities have found that their efforts to attract new believers become much more successful when indigenous Baha'is are in the forefront of the teaching work. 
                           
  H.  Enrolment of Minority  
Groups                     

  While the goal to diversify the community was universal, and the goal to extend and consolidate the teaching work among minority and tribal peoples widely assigned during both phases of the current Plan, only a few such groups were specifically mentioned by name. The numba of tribal and ethnic peoples now represented in the Faith has reached more than 2,100; however, efforts toward rectification of World Centre records on this subject do not yet permit identification of the number first enrolled during the Seven Year 

Plan.                      

 Special projects for teaching ethnic minorities  have been among the most exciting developments in the Plan. In the Americas the 'Trail of Light' project (known as 'Camino del Sol' in the Spanish-speaking countries) was the most spectacular of many projects aimed at reaching indigenous believers. The international team of American Indian and Eskimo  believers from Alaska, Canada and the United States divided into two units which visited Belize, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala,  Honduras; Panama, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Ecuador before meeting and performing  at the Quito and Montreal conferences. Intended as a means of strengthening the ties between the indigenous believers of both American continents, the teams succeeded brilliantly, galvanizing native believers in many places, some of whom had never known of the existence of Indian Baha'is outside their own small communities. 

 Unexpectedly, the teams also proved extremely popular with nonBahA'i  audiences as well, achieving unprecedented levels of proclamation, publicity and popular acclaim and leaving a new spirit behind them wherever they went. 

 Also in the Americas, Brazil has had particular success in reaching Indian believers of new tribes; the Jaguar Project, intended to reach all the tribes of Mexico with the healing Message of Baha'u'llah, has continued in modified form; and smaller-scale projects continue  in other couhtries with large indigenous populations. 

 In North America the Indigenous  Councils of native believers originally

  held in Alaska have become continental in scope uniting believers from Canada, the United States, and 

Central and South America 

 as well. Special projects in the United States have been designed to reach people of Spanish-speaking background in that country, and in both Canada and the United States special efforts have been made among refugees  from Southeast Asia. Among these unfortunate people have been found a number  of believers from the communities of Kampuchea, Laos and Vietnam, and efforts have been made to incorporate them into local Baha community life. Canada has also reported particular teaching success among the Sikh community there, and special efforts have been made to reach the 

Doukhobors.                

 Special projects in Asia have included not only the Amoz Gibson project in the Yercaud tribal district of India but similar projects in the Wynad tribal district in Kerala State, and in 

South Bihar and Orissa;    

 and consolidation projects in the tribal districts of Dang and Jhabua. Another special project in India, carried out with the assistance of friends from Malaysia, has been aimed at reaching the Chinese population of Calcutta, and has resulted in the enrolment of the first Chinese believer in the history of the Indian Baha community. 

 Special projects for reaching the Chinese communities in their countries have also been carried out in Malaysia and other countries. 

     In Australasia, Papua      

 New Guinea has, as always, had particular success in enrolling native believers, despite the formidable teaching  and consolidation problems resulting from the rugged terrain and undeveloped nature of so much of the interior of the country. 

 In Australia longstanding efforts to reach the Aborigines with the Faith have resulted in four Local Spiritual Assemblies in Aboriginal areas, and several others whose majority of members are Aboriginal believers. 

 Special teaching projects have also been directed to the Torres Strait Islands. 

 In New Zealand efforts continue to be made to reach the Maori, and more than forty believers, mostly of Maori background, attended a special conference on translation of the Writings into the Maori language. In Fiji special efforts are now being directed toward the large percentage  of the population which comes from Hindu background. 

 In all European countries, teaching continues  among various minorities, which differ from country to country. Longstanding efforts  to reach the Romany and Same peoples continue, and the number of believers from these backgrounds increases slowly, despite the difficulties in teaching and consolidation created by their nomadic way of life. Denmark  has also had particular success recently in teaching Greenlanders resident in both Greenland and Denmark. In addition to these native peoples, teaching efforts also continue among guest-workers, foreign students, refugees and people from overseas territories such as the 

Dutch Antilles, Suriname   

 and South Molucca. Regular conferences are also held in Germany for believers there from Turkish background, and these may soon be expanded to include Turkish believers from neighbouring countries as well. 

 Also highly gratifying to the House of Justice is the number of reports reaching the World Centre which reflect the increasing tempo of participation by indigenous and minority believers in the initiatives of teaching,  administration, community development, and deepening. An increasing number of native believers from remote parts of the world are also now finding it possible to make the pilgrimage to the Holy Places at the World Centre, with all the resulting spiritual benefits both to themselves and to the communities to which they return. 
                           
16.   Inter-Assembly Collaboration
                           
  A.  Assistance and Collaboration

  Through inter-Assembly collaboration many projects were carried through which otherwise would not have been possible. 

 Goals were assigned for the following types of assistance: — Purchase of mobile and audiovisual institutes, given to nine countries in Africa; — Purchase and/or construction of nine national  and thirty district J-Iazfratu'1-Ouds, thirty-three  in Africa, three in the Caribbean, three in Australasia; — Purchase of six Temple sites, five in Africa, one in Australasia; — Assistance by supplying literature; — Assistance by supplying pioneers and/or deputizing pioneers;


<p132>
132                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  — Assistance by providing self-supported travelling teachers; — Assistance by supporting native travelling teachers; — Assistance by combined teaching on borders  between two countries: Africa 20 (39 areas) 

Americas 7                 
Australasia/New Guinea     

 Europe 10 (24 border areas) — Assistance by exchange of travelling teachers: Europe 28 areas (sets of National Assemblies); 

 — InterNational Spiritual  

 Assembly teaching projects, one in the Americas, two in Australasia, five in Europe. 

 The properties and literature sections of this report describe the collaboration achievements  in those areas. In a few instances, due to local circumstances; oniy token assistance was possible; but in most cases the collaboration extended was substantial and effective. 

 International collaboration in the form of joint teaching projects and exchanges of travelling teachers has given a special stimulus to the growth of the Faith in many countries. Some projects, such as several involving Malaysia, are designed to share the teaching experiences and techniques developed by one community. Often these projects emphasize the wonderful diversity of the Baha'i community, as in the fruitful international cooperation  in teaching native Americans, and in the projects which have brought speakers of one language, for example Turkish, to teach minorities speaking the same language in another country. Many of the projects in Europe have focused the energies of several communities on difficult goals. International projects are exciting and enriching for those who take part, especially as many of the participants are Baha'is who are unable to teach the Faith in their own countries. In one such country the Baha contribute towards the expenses of the teaching teams sent to neighbouring countries each year. Thus far during the Seven Year Plan twenty 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 have collaborated on international teaching efforts other than those in border areas. 

 The greater part of international collaboration  has been in border teaching projects, which have had excellent results in the enrolment of new ethnic groups, expansion in remote areas and in increasing unity and understanding among Baha'is in neighbouring countries. 

Thirty-seven National      
Spiritual Assemblies      

 have taken part in border teaching projects. 
                           
  B.  Pioneers               

  There have been three different pioneer calls during the Seven Year Plan to date. The first phase called for 419 pioneers worldwide; the second phase called for 286, some of which were restatements of the original 419 and others of which were new calls. The third call was made in November 1981, and called for 249 pioneers to settle at specific goals. Again, some of the 249 were new calls and others were restatements of the original calls. 

 As of Ridvan 140, 3,298 pioneers have settled at their posts, of whom 547 are filling specific goals. 

 A summary of the goals and numbers of pioneers settled by continent is as follows: In Africa a total of 761 pioneers were settled at their posts at RidvTh 140; 307 during the first phase, 140 during the second and 314 during the revised 11/81 phase, of whom 143 are filling specific goals.

                        DUBLIN — QUITO — LAGOS — CANBERRA — MONTREAL

  1982 THE Universal House of Justice called for five international conferences to be held to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf and the midpoint point of the Seven Year Plan (1979 — 1986). Originally the AsianlAustralasian Conference was scheduled for Manila, but because of local conditions it could not be held there. It was, therefore, moved to Canberra. 

  The Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone, official representative of the Universal House of Justice, opened the Conference held in Dublin from 25 to 27 June 1982 and challenged the friends to find means of awakening Europe to its spiritual purpose. 'This must now be your constant preoccupation, the subject of your deliberations, the purpose of your lives...' 

  Some 1,900 Baha'is gathered in the premises of the prestigious Royal Dublin Society. The late Hand of the Cause George Townshend's father was a member of this Society and rendered it 'distinguished services'. In attendance at the reception were a number of prominent officials and leaders of thought.

  A poignant part of the programme was the recital of names of those Baha'is in Irdn who have been martyred. Members ofthefamilies of the martyrs were asked to stand. 

  Dr. Baha'i Nakhjavdni spoke on the significance e of the life and services of Baha'i Kh~n urn, the Greatest Holy Leaf, to whose memory the series of Conferences was dedicated. 

  An unforgettable moment occurred on the afternoon of Sunday, 5 September,when 1,200 children came from their own Conference across the Plaza to the Velodrome where they performed their Conference theme song, 'We are Baha 'is~. 

  The children's chorus was under the direction of Jack Lenz, a Canadian composer and musician. Mr. Lenz trained and directed a Baha'i choir and rehearsed and conducted a 25-piece orchestra for the Saturday evening concert.

            HOUSE OF JUSTICE TO THE FIVE
             INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES

    A. TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN DUBLIN
                REPUBLIC OF IRELAND

                  25 — 27 June 1982

  To the Friends gathered at the International Conference in Dublin Dearly-loved Friends, The world is in travail and its agitation waxeth day by day. Such shall be its plight that to disclose it now would not be meet and seemly. 

 The shattering blows dealt to the old, divisive system of the planet and the constantly accelerating decline in civilized life since that dire warning was uttered by Baha'u'llah a hundred years ago, have brought mankind to its present appalling condition. Consideration of how the Baha of Europe, confronted by this situation, can meet their responsibilities, spiritually and actively, is the main purpose of this Conference. 

 The holding of this Conference in Dublin calls to mind the historic and heroic services of Ireland in spreading the divine religion throughout pagan Europe. Europe's response was to develop, through many vicissitudes, the most widespread and effective civilization known. That civilization, together with all other systems in the world, is now being rolled up, and Europe's plight in proportion to her former preeminence, is desperate indeed. 

 By the same token her opportunity is correspondingly great. The challenges to her resilience, to her deep~seated spiritual vitality, nourished over the centuries by the 

Teachings of Christ       

 — now, alas, neglected and even contemned —  can and must call forth a more magnificent response than was ever made by the divided and contending peoples of olden times. 

 Yours is the task to arouse that response. The power of Baha'u'llah is with you and this Day, as attested by the BTh, is immensely exalted. 

 above the days of the Apostles of old. 

 In this great Day Europe is blessed as never before in its history, for the Manifestation of God, the Lord of Hosts, spent five years of His exiles within its borders, sending forth from His remote prison the first of those challenging, world-shaking addresses to the kings and rulers, six of whom were European potentates. 

 There is no authenticated record of a Manifestation of God ever before setting foot in Europe. 

 You are engaged on a Seven Year Plan and have made devoted and sacrificial efforts to attain its objectives. But its ultimate purpose, as that of all other plans, namely the attracting of the masses of mankind to the all-embracing shelter of the Cause of God, still evades us. Particularly in Europe. We have not, as yet, found the secret of setting aglow the hearts of great numbers of Europeans with the divine fire. This must now be your constant preoccupation,  the subject of your deliberations at this Conference, the purpose of your lives, to which you will attain only if you arise to trample beneath your feet every earthly desire •We call upon every Baha'i in Europe to ponder this vital matter in his inmost soul, to consider what each may do to attract greater power to his efforts, to radiate more brilliantly and irresistibly the joyous, regenerating power of the Cause, so that the Baha community in every country of Europe may stand out as a beacon light repelling the dark shadows of godlessness and moral degradation now threatening to obliterate the last remnants of a dying order. We call upon the Continental Board of Consellors to con-suit following this Conference with every National Spiritual Assembly in Europe, and together, launch such a campaign of spiritualization  of the Baha community, allied with intensified personal teaching, as has never been witnessed in your continent. The 156

  goals of the Seven Year Plan can all be accomplished as the result of such a programme and the European Baha'i community may achieve through it the spiritual force and character to demonstrate to a stricken and declining civilization the peace and joy and order of the long-awaited, 

Christ-promised Kingdom    
of God on earth.           

 May the loving spirit and saintly life of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the fiftieth anniversary of whose ascension is commemorated in this Conference, imbue your thoughts and aspirations  and resolves with that dedicated, self sacrificing, utter devotion to Baha'u'llah and His Cause which she so greatly exemplified. 
                           
         B. TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
                  IN QUITO, ECUADOR
                   6 — 8 August1982

  To the followers of Baha'u'llah gathered at the International 

Conference in Quito, Ecuador

  Beloved Friends, We hail with joyous hearts and eager anticipation the soldiers of Baha'u'llah's Army of Light gathered together in Quito, the capital city of the Republic of Ecuador, to do honour and homage to the blessed memory of Baha'u'llah  KMnum the Greatest Holy Leaf, the most outstanding heroine of the Baha'i Dispensation, the fiftieth anniversary of whose ascension was so recently commemorated throughout the world. 

 Conscious of the beloved Master's plea to promulgate the oneness of mankind to a spiritually impoverished humanity, inspired by the memory of the Hand of the Cause Dr. Rahmatu'116h Mirza whose mortal remains are interred in the soil of Quito, and deriving spiritual stimulus from the Mother Temple for Latin America, the friends are reminded of the galvanizing words of our beloved Guardian addressed to the eager, the warmhearted, the spiritually minded and staunch members of these Latin American Baha communities 'Let them ponder the honor which the Author of the Revelation Himself has chosen to confer upon their countries, the obligations which that honor automatically brings in its wake, the opportunities  if offers, the power it releases for the removal of all obstacles, however formidable, which may be encountered in their path, and the promise of guidance it implies Praiseworthy indeed are the achievements thus far made by the communities of South and Central America and the islands of the Caribbean in the first half of the Seven Year Plan. Full advantage should be taken of the current high tide of proclamation engendered by the crisis in frdn to attract to the Cause of Baha'u'llah earnest and seeking souls from every stratum of society, thereby enriching the spiritual and material diversity of our communities. Great effort should be made to utilize more fully the valuable possibilities of radio and television as a means of reaching the vast multitudes whose hearts and minds offer fertile soil for the planting of the seeds of the Faith. 

 All elements of the Baha'i community, particularly the women and youth, should arise as one soul to shoulder the responsibilities laid upon them. All outstanding goals of the Seven Year Plan should be pursued with enthusiasm and assurance of their accomplishment. 

         All National Spiritual     

 Assemblies during the remaining fast-fleeting years of this radiant century, in collaboration with the Institutions of the Faith standing ready and eager to assist them, must greatly reinforce the foundations of maturing 

National and Local Spiritual Assemblies

 to enable them to cope successfully  with the multifarious and challenging problems that will confront them. 

 At a moment in Baha'i history when the persecuted, beleaguered friends in the Cradle.

  of the Faith heroically continue to face the trials ordained for them in the Major Plan of God, meeting martyrdom, as need be, with joyous acceptance, it behooves the friends throughout the Baha'i world to endeavour by their own greatly increased acts of self-abnegation to make fruitful the spiritual energies released by the sacrifices of their stricken brethren. 

 May you all immerse yourselves in the spirit of the saintly life of the Greatest Holy L&af whose self-sacrificing devotion to her beloved Father's Cause is a worthy example for every believer to emulate. 

  c. TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 

                  IN LAGOS, NIGERIA

                  19 — 22 August 1982

  To the Friends gathered at the Baha'i International 

Conference at Lagos        

  Dearly-loved Friends, With hearts overflowing with love for the~ people of Africa, so richly endowed with the gifts of the spirit, so abundantly and repeatedly blessed since the dawn of this Revelation, and so gloriously promising in the unfoldment of their hidden potentialities, we welcome the friends gathered at this Conference held in one of the most important capitals of their emergent continent. 

 As we review the annals of our Faith we see that since the days of the Blessed Beauty and up to the early 1950s, the activities of the friends in Africa had produced the formation of one National Spiritual Assembly with its seat in Cairo, Egypt, the opening of twelve countries to the light of the Faith, and some fifty localities established throughout its vast lands. It was at such a time that the beloved Guardian ushered in the first African Teaching  Plan, to be followed during the remaining years of his ministry and in subsequent years after his passing, by a series of challenging and bravely executed plans designed to implant the banner of the Faith throughout the length and breadth of that continent and its neighbouring  islands.. 

 Today, after the lapse of a little over three decades, we stand in awe as we view with admiration one of the most valiant contingents of the Army of Light, guided by its own Board of Counsellors, led and administered by thirty-seven National Spiritual Assemblies and 4,990 

Local Spiritual            

 Assemblies, privileged to serve an eager and radiant community of believers drawn from 1,152 African tribes residing in 29,000 localities. 

  How wonderful that it has been possible to convene this Conference on African soil with such a large number of African friends in attendance, in loving memory of the most distinguished heroine of the Baha'i Dispensation,  the eldest daughter of the King of Glory, who lived a long life of sacrificial service to the Cause of her Beloved Father. Her meekness, her unassuming nature, the purity of her soul, the sensitivity of her heart, the calmness of her demeanour, her patience and longsuffering in trials, and above all, her unshakeable faith, her tenderness and love, and the spirit of self-renunciation which she evinced throughout her blessed life, are outstanding characteristics that we can well emulate, particularly in Africa, where these heavenly qualities play such an important part in attracting the souls, and winning th~ hearts to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 We rejoice in the knowledge that some communities have already initiated in her name teaching and consolidation campaigns of far-reaching magnitude, that many Baha'i women inspired by her example are accepting an ever-greater share of responsibility in running the affairs of the community, and that numerous newsletters are reflecting eulogies of the station she occupied, the sufferings she endured and the heroism she demonstrated in her love for the glorious Cause of her Lord.


<p159>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA I ACTIVITIES                                159

  The fortunes of the Seven Year Plan in Africa are in the balance. As we draw near to the midway point in the unfoldment of the processes it has set in motion, we call upon its valiant promoters on the African mainland and its surrounding islands, to take stock of their position, to reappraise their progress,  and to concentrate their resources on whatever portions of the goals are as yet unachieved. 

 Chief among its objectives are a widespread recruitment of many more supporters of the Most Great Name, the deepening of the individual believers, for the fulfilment of all goals ultimately depends upon them, and a notable increase in the number of newly-formed as well as firmly-rooted Local Spiritual Assemblies, to serve as bases for the manifold activities of the community, including the Baha'i education of children, a greater participation of women and youth in Baha'i activities, and the formulation of ways and means to enrich the spiritual lives of the 'noble' and 'pure-hearted' believers of a 'fast awakening continent'. 

 May the participants in this Conference carry to the mass of their devoted fellow believers, whose personal circumstances have made it impossible for them to attend, the spirit of joy and optimism which we hope will be generated at this gathering and the flames of enthusiasm which we pray will be enkindled in their hearts. 

 May the memory of the Greatest Holy Leaf, who through her life of heroic self sacrifice has left to us 'a legacy that time can never dim', inspire the friends in every country of the continen~t to rededicate themselves to the Cause of God, not to allow any opportunity for mentioning the Faith to slip by unutilized, and not to permit one day of their Lives to pass without a noble effort to draw nearer to the good-pleasure of the Blessed Beauty. 

 Our fervent prayers surround you as you proceed with your deliberations. 
                          
         D. TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
               IN CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA
                 2 — S September 1982

  To the Friends gathered in the Asian — Australasian Baha'i Conference in 

Canberra                  

  Dearly-loved Friends, These are momentous times. 

 The institutions  of the old world order are crumbling and in disarray. Materialism, greed, corruption and conflict are infecting the social order with a grave malaise from which it is helpless to extricate itself. With every passing day it becomes more and more ,evident that no time must be lost in applying the remedy prescribed by Baha'u'llah, and it is to this task that Baha everywhere must bend their energies and commit their resources. 

 New conditions now present themselves making it easier to accomplish our purpose. Galvanized by the fires of fierce opposition and nurtured by the blood of the martyrs, the forces of the Cause of Baha'u'llah are, at long last, emerging from obscurity. 

 Never before in history has the Faith been the subject of such universal attention and comment. 

 Eminent  statesmen, parliamentarians, journalists, writers, educators, commentators, clergymen and other kaders of thought have raised their voices and set their pens to expressions of honor and revulsion at the persecutions of our brethren in km on the one hand, and to paeans of praise and admiration of the noble principles which motivate the followers of the Most Great Name on the other. 
                          
         The five International    

 Conferences of the Seven Year Plan were called to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf, to discuss anew the present condition of the Faith in a turbulent world society, to examine the great opportunities  for its future growth and development


<p160>
160                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and to focus attention on the unfulfilled goals of the Plan. We are certain that the contein-plation of the gathered friends on the sterling qualities which distinguished the heroic life of the Greatest Holy Leaf will help them to persevere in their noble endeavours. 

    This particular Conference 
is unique in many ways.    

 The geographical area of concern spans over half the globe, including within its purview all the vast continent of Asia as well as the water hemisphere which comprises all of Austrajasia. Within the continent of Asia is the 'cradle of the principal religions of mankind. 

 above whose horizons in modern times, the suns of two independent revelations •    have shecessively arisen     on whose western extremity the Qiblih of the Baha world has been definitely established 

The first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar

 of the Baha'i World was erected on this continent under the direction of 'Abdu'l-Baha and now another is arising on the Indian subcontinent in the midst of the world's largest Baha'i community. 

In Australasia the Mother  

 Temple of the Antipodes, dedicated to the Glory of God just two decades ago, looks out across the vast Pacific Ocean in whose midmost heart still another Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is being built on the mountain slope above Apia in the country of the first reigning monarch to embrace the Faith of 

Baha'u'llah.                

 The population of Asia and Australasia is well over half the world population. 

 The area includes Asiatic U.S.S.R. and mainland China, accounting for more than one thousand  million souls who are, for the most part, untouched by the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Obviously present conditions in these areas call for the exercise of the utmost wisdom and circumspection. 

 Yet this vast segment of humanity cannot be ignored. 

 Canberra, where you are now meeting, is at the southern pole of the spiritual axis referred to in the beloved Guardian's last message to the Baha'is of Australia as 'extending. 

 from the Antipodes to the northern islands of the Pacific ocean .'. Referring to the National Spiritual Assemblies at the northern and southern poles of that axis, Shoghi Effendi went on to say: 'A responsibility, at once weighty and inescapable, must rest on the communities which occupy so privileged a position in so vast and turbulent an area of the globe. However great the distance that separates them; however much they differ in race, language, custom, and religion; however active the political forces which tend to keep them apart and foster racial and political antagonisms,  the close and continued association of these communities in their common, their peculiar and paramount task of raising up and consolidating the embryonic World Order of Baha'u'llah in those regions of the globe is a matter of vital and urgent importance which should receive on the part of the elected representatives of their communities a most earnest and prayerful consideration.' 

 These guidelines, penned a quarter of a century ago, are as valid today as when they were written, and can be taken to heart by all Baha communities on either side of the axis. 

 We are approaching the midway point of the Seven Year Plan. As we review our accomplishments with respect to the goals of that Plan, it is essential that we fortify ourselves for the tasks ahead, and that we rededicate ourselves to that Cause for which our beloved martyrs rendered their last full measure of devotion. 
We can do no less!         

 We shall be with you in spirit during your important deliberations. Our prayers ascend at the Holy Threshold for the success of your Conference and the Jfrternational Conference being held concurrently in Montreal. 

 We shall ardently supplicate that the blessings and confirmations of Baha'u'llah will descend upon you and surround you wherever you go in service to His Faith.

         E. TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
                 IN MONTREAL, CANADA
                 2 — 5 September 1982

  To the Friends gathered at the Baha'i International 

Conference in Montreal     

  Dearly-loved Friends, Seventy years ago 'Abdu'l-Baha visited Montreal, hallowing it forever. The visit of the beloved Master to America, the laying by Him of the cornerstone of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West and the revelation by Him five years later of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, which invest its chief executors and their allies with spiritual primacy, constitute  successive stages in the gradual disclosure of a mission whose seeds can be found in the Bab's address to the peoples of the West, urging them to aid God's Holy Calise. This mission was given specific direction through Baha'u'llah's summons to the rulers of America,  calling on them to heal the injuries of the oppressed and, with the rod of the commandments of their Lord, to bring their corrective influence to bear upon the injustices perpetrated  by the tyrannical and the ungodly. 'Abdu'l-Baha revealed in clearer details than those given by either the Bab or Baha'u'llah the nature and scope of that glorious mission. In His eternal Tablets unveiling America's spiritual destiny the Master wrote, the continent of America is, in the eyes of the one true God, the land wherein the splendours of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide and the free assemble. Therefore, every section thereof is blessed. 

 and, referring to Canada, He asserted that its future is very great, and the events connected with it infinitely glorious. 

 Even more specifically, He expressed the hope that in the future Montreal may become so stirred, that the melody of the Kingdom may travel to all parts of the world from that Dominion and the breaths of the Holy Spirit may spread from that centre to the East and the West of America. 

 After the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha and under the guidance of the Guardian the Baha of the world witnessed with awe and admiration the North American community arising as one man to champion the Adminis trative Order taking shape on their own soil, to embark upon the first collective teaching plan in the annals of the Faith, to Lead the entire Baha world in intercontinental teaching  campaigns, to demonstrate with devotion their exemplary firmness in the Covenant, to extend their support and protection and relief to the oppressed followers of Baha'u'llah throughout the East and particularly in His native land, and to send forth valiant pioneers and travelling teachers to every continent of the globe. These marvellous and noble exertions, calling for the expenditure of resources  almost beyond their means, paved the way for the achievement of glorious victories which synchronized with a series of world convulsions, signs of universal commotion and travail, and with repeated crises within the Faith. 

 And in this day, while the blood of the martyrs of Persia is once again watering the roots of the Cause of God and when the international outlook is impenetrably and ominously dark, the 

Baha'is of North America  

 are in the van of the embattled legions of the 

Cause.                     

 Less than a score of years remain until the end of this century which the Master called the century of light, and He clearly foresaw that ere its termination an advanced stage would have been reached in the striving towards the political, racial and religious unity of the peoples of the world, unfolding new horizons in scientific accomplishments, universal undertakings  and world solidarity. 

 The calls of the Master and the Guardian plainly summon the Baha'is of the Americas to prodigies of proclamation, of teaching and of service. The American melting-pot of peoples needs the unifying power of the new Faith of God to achieve its fusion. 

 The representative character of the Baha community should therefore be reinforced through the attraction, conversion and support of an ever-growing number of new believers from the diverse elements constituting the population  of that vast mainland and particularly from among Indians and Eskimos about


<p162>
162                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 whose future the Master wrote in such glowing terms. In the glorious freedom which enables you to proclaim, to teach and confirm,  to educate and deepen yourselves and others in the verities of the Faith, you have precious opportunities of service denied to many of your fellow believers elsewhere. 

 If your blessed communities are to lead the world spiritually, as the Master envisaged, then the Faith must strike deeper roots in your hearts, the spirit of its teachings must be exemplified in ever greater measure in your lives, and God's Holy Cause must be taught and proclaimed with ever greater intensity. 

In His immortal Tablets    
addressed to the Baha'is of 

North America 'Abdu'l-Baha  

 assures each one of you that whosoever arises in this day to diffuse the divine fragrances, the cohorts of the Kingdom of God shall confirm him You are met in this Conference to review the progress of the Seven Year Plan, to be confirmed, galvanized and sent into action. 

 It is not enough for the North American believers to stand at the forefront of the Baha'i world; the scope of their exertions must be steadily widened. 

 In the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, The range of your future achievements still remains undisclosed. I fervently hope that in the near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your achievements Exert yourselves; your mission  is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly evolve into a centre from which waves of spiritual power will emanate The valiant countries of North America should in the second half of the Seven Year Plan ensure that an ever-swelling number of pioneers and travelling teachers will arise and travel to and settle in countries which need their support, however inhospitable the local conditions may be, ceaselessly endeavouring to contribute to the expansion of the teaching work and the strengthening of the foundations of the corn-munities munities they are called upon to assist. They should, moreover, continue their defence of the downtrodden, open their doors to their Baha'i brethren who are seeking refuge in their lands, provide technological expertise to communities which need it, and supply an uninterrupted flow of resources to support the ever-increasing international projects of the Faith. 

 In their respective homefronts the Baha'is of North America should intensify the drive to attract the masses to God's Holy Cause, to provide the means for their integration into the work of the Faith, and should become standard-bearers of an embryonic Baha'i society  which is destined to gradually emerge under the influence of the integrating and civilizing forces emanating from the Source of God's Revelation. 

 Such noble objectives cannot  be fully achieved unless and until local communities become those collective centres of unity ordained in our Writings, and every individual earnestly strives to support the structure and ensure the stability of the Administrative Edifice of the Faith. 

 How fitting that this Conf&rence, and the one held for Baha'i children on a scale unprecedented in North America, should commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of Baha'i 

KMnum, the Greatest Holy   

 Leaf, whose love for the North American  believers and whose admiration for their heroism were so deep and so sustained and whose natural fondness for children was so characteristic of Baha'u'llah. May each of you emulate her unswerving devotion and loyalty to the Covenant of God and her perseverance in the path of His love. We shall mark this first day of your Conference, together with the one being held concurrently in Canberra, with prayers at the Holy Shrines that all may become assisted in service and like unto brilliant stars shine in these regions with the light of guidance.

  THE BAHA'I community of Africa embraces  fifty mainland countries, plus nine major islands or island groups. At the close of the period under review there were thirty-seven  National Spiritual Assemblies, plus five countries where the Faith had been banned for the time being and the National Assemblies dissolved in accord with government decrees. In Zaire, the 

Universal House of Justice

 had temporarily replaced the National Spiritual Assembly with three Administrative Committees.  There were, by Ridvan 1983, a total of over 5,000 Local Spiritual Assemblies, and the Faith was established in approximately 28,000 localities. 

 During this period three new National Spiritual Assemblies were formed in Africa. In 1980 the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the Baha'is of Transkei had been elected with its seat in Umtata and in 1981 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Bophu-thatswana  with its seat in Mmbatho and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of South West Africa/Namibia with its seat in Windhoek. 

 It is noteworthy that the National Assemblies of Transkei and Bophuthatswana were the first National Spiritual Assemblies to be formed in the former tribal homelands of South Africa which have been declared independent  nations by the government of the Republic. Two other countries had been prepared in this period for National Spiritual Assembly status: 

Cape Verde Islands and Gabon.
The National Spiritual    

 Assembly of Uganda was reformed in 1981 after the Faith had been banned there for a period of nineteen months during the Amin regime. 
                          
Proclamation, Public      

 Relations and the Media Unquestionably, the most notable accomplishment of this historic four-year period in the history of the Faith in Africa stemmed directly from the resurgence and severity of the persecutions in IrAn. In the mid-1950s the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, had linked the sufferings of the believers in Persia to the establishment of the Faith in Africa when he announced that the Mother Temple of Africa would be built in Kampala, Uganda, as a worthy answer to the challenge' of the repressions in fr6n which had prevented the building of the Persian Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. Now, twenty-five years later, the heroic struggle of the Persian believers once again resulted in a major new development in the Faith in Africa through the continent-wide efforts of national communities to publicize the persecutions through press, radio and television, and through public relations programmes designed to reach Heads of State, government officials and prominent people in all walks of life, to explain the plight of the Iranian Baha Community and attract support for its relief. Thus the achievement of two important goals of the Seven Year Plan was advanced to a marked degree: that of contacting people in the upper strata of society and of increasing the use of the media for proclaiming the Faith. 

 In Nigeria, such efforts reached officials and notables in all nineteen states of this vast, 163

 L populous country. In the Ivory Coast, twenty government ministers were contacted, and the authorities then officially condemned the persecutions.  In Kenya, a special and extensive information folder on the situation in IrAn was presented to the Head of State, to all Ministers and to prominent citizens, as well as to the media. 

 In Gambia, public officials of all ranks, from the Head of State and his Ministers to thirty District Chiefs, were contacted and significant amounts of literature were distributed. 

 In Senegal, a wider public recognition of the Faith was achieved through the extensive  press coverage. 

 In Togo, 90 per cent of the government officials down to regional level were reached, and the government recorded a favourable vote for the Faith in the United Nations 

Human Rights Commission. The

 Swaziland Baha'i community had developed  good, friendly relations with the Swazi King, Sobuza, and with his family, as well as with the authorities generally, and were also able to proclaim the Faith widely throughout the country. 
The believers in Malawi,  

Sierra                    
Leone and Upper Volta     

 undertook special programmes of proclamation to public officials and through the media. Togo successfully initiated the use of book exhibitions, as did Madagascar, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. 

 In Reunion Island, all branches of the media were very usefully contacted regarding  the Iranian situation. In Sierra Leone, books were placed for sale at a bookstore, and in several countries gifts of books were made to public and academic libraries. 

 In the Seychelles Islands, radio was very well utilized. In Uganda, Burundi, Zambia and Benin there was very fruitful contact with public officials. In Zambia, the traditional rulers were also approached and introduced to the Faith. 

 In Zambia,.Kenya and Tanzania the Baha'i communities participated as exhibitors at national and regional agriculture and trade shows. 

 Several Baha'i communities had succeeded in obtaining regular weekly programmes on radio. The believers in Central Africin Republic, remarkably, celebrated their first complete decade of weekly Baha radio broadcasts,


<p165>

  alternately in French and in the Sango language, and their admirable record of good public relations continued. Liberia obtained a 15-minute weekly radio programme, plus the broadcasting of Baha'i prayers and readings morning and evening. 

 Chad also had a weekly radio broadcast. 

 In the broader field of international relations, the Togo Community admirably supported United Nations events, including the special Years of the Handicapped and of Disarmament,  and made use of distinguished guest speakers on these occasions. Botswana also did a fine job of supporting United Nations activities and programmes. In Kenya, where a number of United Nations agencies have their world or regional offices, there was frequent representation of the Faith at international conferences as well as very cordial exchange of speakers for United Nations Day programmes. 
                           
Teaching                   

 The peoples of Africa have long been spiritually receptive to the Faith, and attracting individuals to the Cause has never been difficult. During the period of this report there continued to be a good, steady increase in the numbers of people entering the Faith, though the general pace of teaching slowed in some countries in contrast to the dramatic increase of earlier years. 

 This was largely due to the requirements of consolidation and to the generally difficult social and political conditions  prevailing in some areas. The number of newly-opened localities likewise increased steadily, though a pattern of lapsing 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 emerged in areas where sizeable numbers of Assemblies had been formed in quick order. 

 The work of the Continental Board of Counsellors and the Auxiliary Board members in assisting the National Spiritual Assemblies and the National Teaching Committees to develop special teaching projects, particularly in fulfilment of the goal of encouraging entry of new believers into the Faith 'by troops', is noteworthy. Many such projects were both creative and fruitful. Teaching across the borders between countries was found to be very useful in West Africa and was successfully carried on by the believers in Liberia, Ivory Coast and 

Guinea, between Upper      

 Volta and Togo, and by Senegal, 

Mauritania and Gambia. Also

 in southern Africa, there were projects which brought about cooperation amongst the friends in Zambia, Zaire and Angola. 

 Several countries had outstanding or unusual results in the teaching field. 

 In Benin, there was an exhilarating surge of success in the months following the Lagos International Conference when a number of satellite conferences  and international travelling teachers brought new stimulation. In Botswana, there was intensified teaching amongst the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert. In Kenya, several projects, particularly attractive to the youth, were organized and successfully carried out for entry by troops, while in Tanzania, a similar very successful project took place on the Ukererwe 

Islands of Lake Victoria.  

 In Togo, the members of the Gourma tribe, which had formerly rejected both Christianity and Jshm, embraced the Faith with particular responsiveness. 

 Through several intensive teaching projects in which the youth played a vital role, the size of the Togolese community was doubled in this four-year period. 

 Nigeria also successfully persevered in developing entry by troops' activities, as did Ivory Coast where 700 new believers were recorded in one such project in the Bangolo area. 

 Upper Volta managed to double its number of 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 and localities and to send African travelling teachers to Mali and Ghana, while Mali, a small community, quadrupled its Local Spiritual Assemblies and localities. In Cape Verde, where the islanders are very receptive, all the islands were opened to the Faith, and the number of believers was increased several times over. Malawi had steady success in its teaching activities which were carried on by well-deepened Malawian believers. 

 In Transkei, the pioneers and indigenous  believers worked happily and successfully together in teaching teams. In both Chad and Zimbabwe, despite severe civil disturbances and necessary changes in teaching areas and patterns, good results were recorded. In both Zimbabwe and Cameroon, teaching in the cities received special emphasis. 

Both Zambia and Bophuthatswana

 concentrated heavily and with marked success on both individual and Local Spiritual Assembly extension teaching. 

 Many outstanding teaching conferences took


<p166>
166                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 place during this period which greatly encouraged and stimulated the believers throughout  the continent. 
The colourful and vibrant Lagos

International Conference  

 in August of 1982, attended by the Hand of the Cause John Robarts and 1,150 believers from 46 countries and 90 ethnic groups, followed by many fine satellite conferences throughout West Africa, as well as by three in Southern Africa and one in East Africa attended by the Hand of the Cause William Sears, all brought rich results in increased teaching and were a significant turning point in the affairs of the Faith in West Africa particularly. A number of regional teaching conferences brought together believers from sizeable groups of countries. One of the most successful was held at Ouagadougou in Upper Volta, attended by 100 believers from eight countries. 

 The need to reach all strata and components of society brought about a greater diversification of teaching methods and projects than had ever formerly been the case. 

 In many areas special efforts were made to reach all sectors of the community in imaginative ways: for example, the effort in Tanzania to address the members of the various professions through teaching activities specifically related to their mode of work. 
                          
Consolidation             

 The major challenge faced by the majority of the National Baha'i communities in Africa during this period was that of successfully consolidating the many teaching victories won during both the Nine and Five Year Plans: the thousands of new believers and localities and the hundreds of Local Spiritual Assemblies to be preserved and deepened. At the commencement  of the period under review, there occurred a sudden outflow from the continent of pioneers who had tenaciously held to their posts until the end of the Five Year Plan but were unable to stay longer. This loss, combined with the seemingly inevitable drop in numbers of 

Local Spiritual Assemblies

 as the communities  paused for breath, plus the inexperience  of many 

Local Spiritual Assemblies

 and Regional Teaching Committees, brought the consolidation needs into sharp focus. 

 In the larger communities this was particularly the case: Cameroon, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zafre. 

 The goals of the Seven Year Plan reflected a strong emphasis on this vital Some of the forty-three participants who attended the first Bahd'z'Summer School held in Victoria, 

           Cameroon Republic; March 1980.


<p167>

  requirement. A truly heroic struggle commenced  in which all the institutions of the Faith combined efforts in coming to grips with the urgency and scope of this problem, bringing about a significant broadening and diversification of activities including an increased  focus on the use of the Creative Word of God as a deepening instrument. 

 During the first two phases of the Seven Year Plan there was strong emphasis in the activities of most national communities on the holding of deepening institutes and conferences as well as Summer or Winter Schools, all of which gradually became regular and successful aspects of Baha'i community life. 

 In the southern part of the continent an annual international  Summer School which, by mutual agreement, was held in a different country each year, became an especially attractive event on the Baha'i calendar. 

 In Chad, deepening institutes and conferences were successfully combined with village teaching projects carried out by the Chadian believers as they travelled long distances by foot through the remote rural areas. 

 In Upper Volta the emphasis was placed on helping 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 to take responsibility for their own annual reelection. 

 In Central African Republic, deepening of the individual believers and their participation in both the teaching and administration of the Faith were the objectives of special nine-day institutes; also, a twelve-lesson correspondence course was started for the assistants to the Auxiliary Board members. In Malawi as well, the emphasis was on strengthening the individual believers, including the women and youth, and conveying to them the Baha'i way of life and service. In Zambia, special efforts were made to train the officers of the Local Spiritual Assemblies and success was achieved in raising  up some very capable, devoted believers. In Swaziland, local deepening/teaching conferences  for small areas accessible by foot proved useful. In Kenya, correspondence courses were started for the Local Spiritual Assemblies, and the 'mother' Assembly principle  was applied in an effort to help the weaker Assemblies. 

 The registration of Baha'i births and deaths progressed quite methodically in some countries and was a project very well received by the believers in general. 

 The establishment in Nigeria in 1982 of the West 

Africa Centre for Baha    

 Studies was another step in the consolidation process. 

 In a number of countries the problem of consolidation was compounded by the disturbed  civil state of the country or its economic problems; but the believers struggled perseveringly  to continue the teaching activities, preserve the local communities and fulfil their goals. 
Uganda, Zimbabwe, Ghana,   

Chad, Mozambique and Zaire 
were amongst such countries.

 In other areas the activities of the Faith were temporarily suspended by government order, e.g. in Niger and Congo. 

 Reference should be made here to the very effective efforts made by Dr. 'Azfz Navidi to assist the many 

French-speaking National Spiritual

 Assemblies to cope with problems related to the banning of the Faith and to difficulties in obtaining official recognition of the Cause, as well as in a variety of other legal problems, not to mention his attendance on behalf of the Faith at international conferences and his successful public relations activities with numerous government leaders and people prominent in public or private life. 

  The Hands of the Cause The visits of the Hands of the Cause of God William 

Sears and John Robarts     

 played an important part during these years in the consolidation and progress of the Faith on the African Continent. 

 The Loss, however, of the Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga, murdered in most brutal circumstances in his own home in Kampala, Uganda, with his wife and three youngest children, dealt a terrible blow to the rank and file of the believers whose love and respect he bad attracted through his radiant spirit, his devotion to the Uganda Baha community during its long travail, his warm sense of humour and his loving manner. Likewise, the passing of the Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'llAh MuhAjir was sorely felt in Africa where he had laboured so assiduously and conscientiously in the promotion of the mass teaching work. 

 When he heard the shocking news of Mr. Olinga's death, the Hand of the Cause William Sears, former pioneer in Southern Africa, promptly offered to reside and serve again in Africa, at least for a period, after having been absent from its shores for a number of years. Mr. Sears's presence subsequently lent signifi

cant support to the new   

Continental Board of Counsellors

 in Africa at the time of its formation in November, 1980, and his travels in the south served greatly to encourage and stimulate the believers in those parts of the continent. 

 The Hand of the Cause John Robarts also travelled to visit the friends in Africa where he had formerly pioneered for many years, and was most warmly welcomed by many whom he had not seen in the long years since his return to Canada. 
                          
The Continental Board     
of Counsellors            

     The Continental Board     

 of Counsellors for Africa, the members of the two Auxiliary Boards and their large number of assistants throughout the continent were very active partners with the 

National Spiritual Assemblies 

 in virtually all aspects of the development of the Faith and the pursuit of the goals in Africa during this period. The campaign for improved standards in the teaching work which was launched by the Counsellors at the Lagos International Conference was very well received, and its prompt implementation now augurs well for the future in the sound spread of the Faith to new areas. 

 The travels of the Counsellors and the Auxiliary Board members to many parts of the continent and their varied activities there seemed to encourage and guide the communities and to provide for both the 

Universal House of Justice

 and the International Teaching Centre a clear picture of what was transpiring everywhere. There was a heartening continuation of the close, warm collaboration between the Counsellors and thg National Spiritual Assemblies which had long characterized their work together. 
                          
The Youth                 

 The youth of the Baha'i communities of Africa were a joy to behold in this period, especially the second generation of youngsters whose parents had been the stalwart pillars of the Cause in countries such as Uganda, Kenya and Cameroon since its inception in those areas. 

 Many of these young people arose during the years of this review to study the teachings deeply, to spearhead the 'entry by troops' projects, to reach out with the Message of Baha'u'llah to their own educated generation  in schools and colleges and to organize themselves for the service of the 

Faith.                    
National Youth Committees 

 became more prevalent and effective in their work; the scope of the youth activities was broadened to include conferences, school and university study classes, clubs, singing groups, social and sports activities. Likewise, the youth became an essential and vital element in the Baha'i community as a whole. 
                          
The Women and Children    

 One of the most important and significant developments in the Faith in Africa during the period of this report was the greatly increased consciousness of the needs and, in some places, the solid work done in the field of Baha child education. 

 The improved production of syllabuses and lessons, the training of teachers, the running of tutorial schools and the holding of local children's classes, though still totally inadequate to meet the needs of the large number of Baha children in Africa, offers firm ground for future progress. 

 The initiation in Nigeria of a Baha'i children's quarterly magazine, The Shining Stars; the holding of a children's conference in Gambia and the efforts made for the introduction of Baha'i religious knowledge classes in the schools there; the many children's classes held in Chad and the opening of a nursery school there; the running of a Baha kindergarten in the precincts of the 

Mother Temple of Africa   

 in Kampala; the opening of a number of 'education centres' in ZaYre; the production of lessons for children in Rwanda; the numerous children's activities on Reunion Island, are all examples of the types of child education programmes that had been initiated in various parts of the continent. 

 Parallel with the work amongst the children was the development of women's activities, some of which related to the role of Women as mothers. The fiftieth anniversary of the passing  of the Greatest Holy Leaf stimulated the holding of women's conferences dedicated to her memory, some attended by prominent non-BahA'f women. In Gambia, an essay competition on the role of women was conducted in her honour and a public award ceremony held. In Liberia, a special cassette tape was prepared about her life and services. In Togo, special conferences were held on family life. 

 In Senegal, a special deepening  course for women was sponsored.

  The first Local Spiritual Assembly of Mariental, South West Africa/Namibia, whose members are of five different tribes and speak as many languages; 14 September 1980. 

  the emphasis on women in the Faith, there was also a notable increase in the number of properly-conducted Baha'i marriages in some countries. National women's and chiLdren's  committees were appointed in many countries and have served to increase effectively  the Baha'i activity in both groups. 

 In most countries, the number of women active in the Faith and serving on its institutions substantially increased. 
                           
Literature                 

 Amongst the most encouraging signs of progress in Africa during this period was the more widespread and intensive translation publication and dissemination of the Hoiy Writings and other literature about the Faith in the numerous vernacular languages of Africa. This literature programme was assisted through the formation of two new Baha'i Publishing Trusts, in the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. Likewise, the legal registration of the Publishing Trust of Kenya and the reactivation of the Uganda Publishing Trust served to advance still further these objectives. 

The                        

 value of cassette tapes of the Holy Writings was gradually realized, and the work of producing such material took hold as the goal was pursued. 

 The establishment of an International  AudioVisual 

Distribution Centre in Ivory

 Coast laid a foundation for the future in that field. 

 Especially notable victories in the field of literature were the translation and publication of The 

New Garden, by Hushmand    

 Fatheazam, in four of the seven vernacular languages of Zambia and the publication and dissemination of 

Paris Talks and Nabil's    

 Narrative in Swahili by the Publishing Trust of Kenya. Central African Republic, Cameroon, South Africa, Swaziland and Togo carried out particularly active programmes of translation and publication  during this period. 

 The more regular production of national, regional, local and youth news bulletins, a number of them bilingual, served greatly to stimulate the believers, deepen them and inform them of what was planned and carried out in their own communities and abroad. This was a much needed and very beneficial development in Africa.


<p170>
170                THE BAHA'I WORLD

Properties                

 The acquisition of Baha'i properties continued to add substance and grace to the Baha'i community. 

 In the Ivory Coast, a new National Haziratu'1-Quds was built, and in Gabon and Mauritania the first National f{azfratu'1-Quds were acquired. In Benin, two regional centres were obtained and in Nigeria and Mali one each. In several countries, national and district centres were renovated or enlarged, and in numerous areas local centres were erected. 

 In Bomi Hills, Liberia, cemetery land was acquired; and in Malebo, Equatorial 

Guinea, a National Hazfratu'1-Quds 
site was bought. The      

Mother Temple. of Africa  

 in Kampala was renovated throughout, as were the 

National Hazfratu'1-Quds  

 and institute  buildings nearby. In Chad, the Saman-dan  Institute was completed and put to use. In Zambia, the temple site was developed through digging of a borehole, erection of a caretaker's dwelling, and through levelling, clearing and planting of many trees on the land. Likewise, in Zambia, a regional centre in Mumbwa was upgraded to an institute through addition of a dormitory and kitchen. 

  Three subjects remain to be mentioned in this report each one of which is essential and carries with it its own special perfume. 
                          
Pioneers and Travelling   
Teachers                  

 The first is the pioneers, both international and home-front, without whose dedicated, sacrificing services the progress of the Cause in Africa would be severely handicapped. There are large populous countries and Baha communities in Africa, such as Zaire, Kenya, Tanzania, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, Nigeria and Uganda, where the presence  of the pioneers has long been and still is almost indispensable to the general perpetuation and welfare of the community. 

 There are other areas as yet little open to the Faith where the pioneers have been working in almost virgin situations, such as Cape Verde Islands, the Guineas, Gabon, Somalia, 

Dji-bouti  and St. Helena 

 Island. But wherever they are and in whatever circumstances they labour their services have been vital and deeply appreciated. 

 Similarly, the many devoted, able, experienced international and national travelling teachers who have visited the coun tries of Africa have contributed another very valuable element to the activities on that vast, needy continent. 
                          
Financial Self-support    

 The second is the subject of the efforts made for self-support by the national communities.  There was a very considerable and sacrificial struggle in many countries to win this goal. Considerable solid success has attended this effort, which has been generously and substantially supported by the international pioneers everywhere but which has also been lovingly and touchingly the object of the concern and pride of the African believers too: as example, the simp1~ village woman in Kenya who insisted on paying for the cablegram to President Khomeini appealing against the martyrdom of the Iranian believers. 

 Numerous countries were able to achieve self-sufficiency in regard to their administrative expenses, while a number of other countries achieved virtually total financial independence in all of their activities. 

 The Nigeria community not only became self-supporting but, astoundingly, paid all of the heavy expense of holding the Lagos International Conference as well. Many other countries greatly reduced their dependence on the international funds of the Faith. And all without exception became more deeply conscious of the need to strive in that direction. 
                          
The Holy Land             

 And finally, mention must be made here of the developing role of the Hoiy Land in the spiritual life of the Baha'i community of Africa. A gradual stream of African believers had begun to arrive as pilgrims at the World Centre of the Faith in 'Akka and Haifa, and a number of communities rejoiced and tknefited in this period to receive their radiant returning pilgrims. 

Likewise, the International

 Convention  of 1983 witnessed a far larger contingent of African delegates than ever before, with some of the communities sending all nine members of their 

National Spiritual Assemblies. 

 Some of the first African women pilgrims and delegates arrived in the Holy Land in this period and returned to Africa to convey in their quiet way a new sense of the sacredness of the Faith and its Holy Places, a deep consciousness of the urgency of its affairs and


<p171>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                171

  its teaching work, and a feeling of love of and devotion to the Universal House of Justice which will long serve to strengthen the ties which bind the Bab6'i world together and link it to its spiritual heart. 
                           
                   B. THE AMERICAS

  The area comprising the Americas includes North, Central and South America, Bermuda, the Bahamas and the islands of the Caribbean. 

 At the close of the period under review there were thirty-eight National Spiritual Assemblies, more than 6,000 Local Spiritual Assemblies, and the Faith was established in more than 25,000 localities. 

 Fortunately, this part of the Baha world community still enjoys  relative freedom to propagate the Faith. 

 Nevertheless, political unrest in Central and parts of South America hindered the progress of the Faith somewhat. In Nicaragua, some Baha'is left the country, many more were timid about attending meetings of any kind, and some of the pioneers had to leave. 

 Baha communities in the extensive Department of Zelaya were lost because the believers, most of them Indians, had been driven out. In spite of these difficulties, the morale of the Baha, and in particular, the National Spiritual Assembly  and National Teaching Committee, has remained high; and starting in 1983, new expansion proj ects were initiated which are attracting new believers, especially youth, and resulting in new Local Spiritual Assemblies. 

 Travelling teachers were not often allowed to visit the believers in Argentina. 

 Frequent disruptions in communications also affected the transmission of news and information within the Baha'i community. 

 The believers in Bolivia had to withstand such strong opposition from local fanatical elements, both political and religious, that appeals had to be made to the civil courts. 

 Disregarding the tests and difficulties, most of the believers have remained firm in the Faith and stand ready to respond to the great receptivity that obtains amidst the confusion and clamour. 

 During the period under review, five new National 

Spiritual Assemblies       
were formed in the Americas.

 At Ridvan 1981, three new National Assemblies came into being: Bermuda with its seat in Hamilton, the Leeward Islands with its seat in St. John's Antigua and the Windward Islands with its seat in Kingstown, St. Vincent. 

 Ridvan 1983 saw the establishment of the National Spiritual Assembly of Dominica with its seat in Roseau and of St. Lucia with its seat in Castries. 
                           
Proclamation               

 As the year 1979 reached its midway point, the outbreak of persecutions in I r6n powerfully galvanized the believers throughout the hemisphere  as never before. The wide publicity accruing to the Faith in the wake of these tragic events raised proclamation to a height never before attained in the history of the Cause. Unprecedented results were obtained by many national communities when they appealed to their governments. For example, the Canadian Parliament passed a unanimous resolution condemning the increasing persecution  of the Baha'i community of fr6n. Following this action, the National Spiritual Assembly successfully negotiated, with a very sympathetic Department of Immigration, the granting of refugee status to hundreds of bona fide Baha'is stranded outside IrAn, and the process continues. 

 The intensification of the cruel hardships imposed upon the Baha'is in the cradle of the Faith and the sharp increase in the number of those martyred, drove the believers in the West to the depths of agony and, at the same time, made them more determined than ever to proclaim the Faith through all forms of mass communication media. The press in many places was extremely sympathetic and generous, often commenting on the noninflammatory  character of our releases, their accuracy and human appeal. Memorial programmes  for those martyred brought national and local press and television coverage. One such programme for the seven martyrs of Yazd held in the United States at the Temple in Wilmette, supported by hundreds of simul


<p172>
172                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  taneous programmes throughout the country, was covered by national and local television and generated a flood of publicity. 
     In the United States on   

25 May 1982, the Subcommittee

 on Human Rights and International Organizations of the 

Foreign Affairs Committee 

 of the U.S. House of Representatives  heard the testimony of six witnesses concerning the persecution of the Baha'is in IrAn. A two-hour videotape of this Congressional hearing was shown widely throughout the country generating further publicity. 

 A rabbi in Norfolk, Virginia, was moved by the persecutions to host a memorial programme in the synagogue and he made the book A Cry from the Heart, written by the Hand of the Cause William Sears, the centrepiece of a large mailing to his colleagues throughout the country. Baha'i youth clubs distributed 3,500 copies of Mr. Sears's book on more than 280 college campuses. 

 In addition to numerous resolutions being passed in both Houses of the United States Congress, a record number of speeches recorded  in the Congressional Record, and forceful editorials in almost all of the major newspapers in the country, public recognition reached new heights when President Reagan issued a statement strongly protesting the killing of Baha'is, calling upon the Iranian authorities to spare the lives of those who had been condemned to death, and inviting other world leaders to join him in appealing, on behalf of the Baha'is, to the government of IrAn. 

 In Panama, wide publicity about the persecutions of Baha'is in IrAn caused people in remote rural communities to enquire about the Faith. 

 Hundreds of copies of the book, A Call to the Nations, were presented to the higher levels of society in the French Antilles and the 'White Paper on Iffin' was sent to mayors, government officials, the Prefect and Deputy-Prefect. 

 Numerous government officials throughout the Americas experienced indignation upon hearing of the cruelties meted out to the Baha and gave sympathetic attention to the appeals on their behalf. Some sent cables to the government of Ir6n, others paved the way for widespread media coverage of local 

Baha'i activities. This   

 was especially notable in Belize and Costa Rica. 

 There can be no doubt that the attacks on the Baha'is in Ir6n, unparalleled in viciousness  and intensity since the early days of the Cause, opened the door to an unprecedented public recognition of the Faith and contributed  to its gradual emergence from obscurity. 

 Another kind of proclamation activity aroused indigenous believers to a new level of participation. In 1981 the project called Camino Del Sd or 'Trail of Light' was launched through collaborative efforts of the Continental 

Board of Counsellors      

 and several National Spiritual Assemblies in the Americas. Indigenous believers from North America travelled through Central and South America in a programme of cultural exchange which included participation in the 

Intercontinental Conference

 in Quito, Ecuador, and in the Continental Indigenous Council on the Blood Reserve in Canada, and which culminated in a presentation of traditional songs and dances by the indigenous people attending the 

Intercontinental  Conference
in Montreal, Canada.      

 It is estimated that close to 10,000 people became aware of the Faith through this project. In Guatemala, those showing intense interest and support around San Juan Chameloo, Alta Verapaz, included government  officials, educators and students. 

 The diversity of the visiting group clearly demonstrated the principle of the oneness of mankind  and that, in itself, appealed to the population wherever they travelled. In Honduras, the team visited the Paya and Jicaque tribes and rekindled their eagerness to let the Faith illumine their lives. 

 Nor was that all. Other aspects of the teaching work quickened as well. 

 Many projects  were dedicated to the martyrs and to deceased Hands of the Cause. 

 Efforts have been made to align proclamation activities more closely with expansion and consolidation. 

 In NicaThgua, several well planned and executed public meetings were held at the Intercontinental Hotel and were attended by leading citizens. 

 Unsolicited press notices arising from such meetings have opened new doors. 

 Another kind of public recognition came to the Faith in Panama when the National Spiritual Assembly successfully petitioned the government to issue a stamp to commemorate

  Bus posters, such as this one used in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A., invited the public to investigate the teachings of the Baha'i Faith. 

 the tenth anniversary, in April 1982, of the formal dedication of the Mother 

Temple of Latin America.  
                          
Expansion and Consolidation

 Perhaps one of the best signs of the gYowing maturity of the Baha'i community is that expansion and consolidation activities are being integrated. 

The Colombian Baha'i      

 community  achieved a high degree of success in this respect. For sixteen months, some twenty-two teams engaged in regular visits to communities to help in organizing Nineteen Day Feasts, children's classes, youth meetings, and discussions of family life as well as aiding in the enrolment of new believers. This organic approach brought 12,000 new believers into communities ready to absorb them into Baha'i activities. 

 Based on this experience, another programme  evolved which holds promise for even more effective integration of the expansion-consolidation process. Under this programme a group of five to ten teachers visit a community for five to ten days. 

 In the mornings, the teachers engage in deepening and spiritual enrichment for themselves. In the afternoon, they visit families and attempt to converse with each member. Each one is invited to join the Faith. In the evenings, meetings are held with the entire community. By Ridvan 1983, seven to eight communities had been touched by the expansion-consolidation campaign. The results were exhilarating indeed. 

 The number of Baha'is in each community, including children, had more or less tripled. 

 A number of youth had arisen to participate in deepening  classes, and the Local Spiritual 

Assemblies                

 had developed a new vision of their function. The campaigns were also serving the purpose of raising new teachers and confirming them in the service of the Cause. Parallel to these activities, the Ruhi Institute was strengthened during this period and its field of service expanded. The nine courses pertaining to the first level of studies at the Institute programme  were gradually taken to other parts of the country through extension courses, each lasting about two weeks. Finally, the courses were established as a tutorial programme serving not only Colombia but other Latin American countries. 

 An increasing number of teachers from the Ruhi Institute began courses in villages and neiglibourhoods of the cities on a weekly or biweekly basis, thus bringing the benefits of a very effective deepening course to a larger and larger number of youth. 

 Further development of the Ruhi Institute courses took place when in 1982 a pilot programme for the training of teachers for Baha'i preschool centres was established. This proved very successful and by Ridvan of 1983 Baha'i kindergartens were functioning in seven villages in the region near Cali. These preschool centres have proved to be important  factors in the functioning of the Local Spiritual Assemblies. 

 Honduras has also benefited from teaching campaigns that carry out expansion-consoli-dation activities simultaneously. 

 Through a series of annual projects, entitled 'Operations and carrying such names as 'Daybreak' and 'Badf", the Baha'i population was more than tripled and the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies substantially increased. These projects utilized a permanent nucleus of some

  five experienced and capable Baha'is with the help, in different sections of the country, of local pioneers and teachers. 

 The core team stayed in each area approximately a week, publicly proclaiming the Faith and teaching all sectors of the population. 

 The area most receptive was that of the socalled 'Caribs', or 'Garifunas' — a mixture of the original Indian population of the Caribbean and black Africans, who live along the north coast of Honduras. Some of their villages now are from fifty to ninety per cent Baha'i. 

 Another important indicator of increasing Baha'i maturity is that indigenous peoples are taking more initiative in shouldering the responsibility for propagating and administering the affairs of the Faith. 

 This trend is noted particulaitly in Alaska, Bolivia, Argentina, Canada, the United States and in some of the Caribbean 

Islands.                   
    Institutes and Native      

 Councils are favourite structures for indigenous activity. 

In July 1980, the Native   

 American Council held in Wilmette brought together fifty tribes under the dome of the holiest Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. This activity, the fruit of collaboration of the Baha'i communities of Alaska, Canada and the United States, was visually spectacular, spiritually dynamic, procedurally unique and a source of inspiration to all whd experienced it. The movement of these believers through these countries released a spiritual impulse whose ramifications are incalculable. 

     In Canada, Native Councils 

 have become an important element in the encouragement of believers of Indian and Inuit heritage to freely consult about the expansion and consolidation  of the Faith among their own groups and provided the milieu within which they could, themselves, assume responsibilities for the progress of the Cause of God. Similarly, tCoundll' consultations have also been an effective arena in which the French-speaking believers could air their views and become inspired to further promote the work of the Faith. 

 Alaska's institute structure accommodates weekend activities. 

 Five-day youth institutes were held yearly in June and December. Teaching in the load area was an integral part of this experience. 

     The Guaymis of Panama      

 have arisen to become the executors of a plan to develop a cultural centre which will involve a Baha'i Antonio Cruz of Veracruz, Mexico, first Baha'i of the Totonaco tribe in that city (wearing traditional dress).

  Participants in the second continental indigenous council photographed on the steps of the House of Worship, Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.A. The gathering, held in July 1980, was attended by the Hand of the Cause Dhikru'lldh Khddem several Counsellors; members of the National Spiritual Assemblies of Alaska, Canada and the United States; and by representatives of more than fifty tribes indigenous to the Americas. Mr. Amoz Gibson is seen seated in the centre of the front row with Mrs. Mary Gibson. 

 educational programme directed towards moving the entire population under the shadow and protection of the Faith. 

 The convocation of the first Native Council in Panama which provided an unfettered sounding board for the Guaymis at the time of the visit of the first 'Trail of Light' contingent represented a tremendous step forward in the development of the consultative process in the Indian way. The impact was tremendous and helped instil in these believers new pride in their indigenous origins and the desire to recapture and preserve their heritage as they move forward and become effective contributors to the establishment of a future worldwide civilization, the crowning point of this Revelation. 

 Bush Negro believers in Surinam are likewise assuming responsibility for the spread of the 

Faith. A Regional Teaching 

 Committee composed entirely of Bush Negro believers is now functioning actively. 

 Frequent teaching trips to villages along the river, are organized. For transportation, the teaching teams use a small river boat which was built by the Bush Negro friends and which is powered by an outboani motor purchased with money from the national Baha Fund. One district t{azfratu'I-Quds is in use along this river, and more local Flaziratu'L-Quds are in the plan-fling  stage. 

 The spiritual receptivity of the Bush Negroes is evidenced by comments heard in some villages where travelling teachers have taken the Faith more recently. These dear people gently asked why the Faith had been taken first to villages further up the river. They had heard the wonderful news, were anxious to receive the Faith, and did not wish to be 'bypassed'  by the Baha'i teachers. 

 Yet another sign of the growing maturity of Baha communities is that the number attaining  financial self-sufficiency has increased during this period and others are earnestly striving to achieve this goal. A closely related and district goal is that local                        Hazfratu'1-Quds be acquired and carefully maintained. That number, too, is growing. 

 Efforts to serve mankind may be seen in the development of tutorial schools and educational


<p176>
176                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  centres. Bolivia has made notable progress in this direction. These centres will offer the Baha'i Teachings, literacy classes for children and adults, and practical courses such as sanitation, agriculture and the like. 

 The ability of Local Spiritual Assemblies to hold their own elections, without outside assistance, attests to their growing maturity. In order to prepare remote villages to hold their own elections each Ridvan, an 'election' tape was made by the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska and certain villages were chosen to receive it. Some were able to elect their own Assemblies at Ridvan 1983. 

 In this maturing process, a most welcome trend is the steady increase in the number of Baha'i Summer and Winter Schools and the gradual improvement in the quality of the courses being offered. 
                          
Youth                     

 Galvanized by the martyrdom of some of their peers in fnil, thousands of youth have come forward, offering their services in all aspects of the teaching work including proclamation, expansion and consolidation. 

 There has been an upsurge of international collaboration at the border area between Surinam and Guyana. This led to a highly successful first International Youth Camp held in Nw. Nickerie, Surinam, in March 1983, which was attended by 130 believers from Guyana, 

Surinam and French Guiana. Plans

 are under way to make this an annual event. 

 In Trinidad and Tobago, two active regional  youth committees have gradually involved  the Baha'i youth of the country in village teaching, deepening meetings, pro-claination  activities, and the teaching of chil-drens' classes, leading up to a successful National 

Baha'i Youth Conference.  

 At the University of the West Indies, interest in the Faith has increased, and several staff members and students have enrolled. 
     The number of regional    

Youth and National Conferences

 called for in the Seven Year Plan has been surpassed many times throughout the region.

     A Continental Youth Conference

 held in Kansas City in July 1982 was graced by the participation of 

Abdu'l-Baha Rtihiyyih KIAnum.

 Youth have done an outstanding job proclaiming  the Faith on their college campuses. They have organized youth and high school clubs, participated in service projects, and developed 'buddy' systems for pre-youth. 

  The Hands of the Cause The irretrievable loss of five Hands of the Cause during the first phase of the Plan made us all more keenly aware of the inestimable value of the services of the Chief Stewards of our Faith. The remaining Hands of the Cause solaced us in our grief and continued to extend their loving services, nurturing and inspiring Baha'i communities in all parts of the world. 

 One of the most significant events to occur in Canada during 1982 was the extended visit of Hand of the Cause 

Abdu'l-Baha Rahfyyih Khdnum.

 In addition to the major role that this beloved Hand carried out as representative of the Universal House of Justice at the International Conference in Montreal, intensive  visits within Canada were undertaken to such widely scattered communities as: Halifax, Sydney, and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; Saint John, 

New Brunswick; Summerside, Prince
Edward Island; Montreal    

 and the Magdalen Islands, Quebec; Toronto and Port Hope, 

Ontario; and Whitehorse    
and Carcross Yukon.        

 Trier deep love for the native people of North America was reflected in visits to many Indian reserves including: Blood Reserve, Alberta (where a major Native Council took place); Carcross Band 

Reserve, Yukon; Fountain  
Band and Thunder Bird      
Band Reserves in           

British Columbia; Peigan   
Reserve, Alberta;          
Dreamers Rock at Whitefish 
Bay Reserve,               

Manitoulin Island, Ontario;
Lennox Island              
Reserve, Prince Edward     
Island; and Eskasoni       
Reserve, Nova Scotia.      

 Believers in some of Canada's geographically remote communities, which all too seldom receive travelling teachers, will be forever grateful for her loving consideration in visiting: St. John's and Grand Falls, Newfoundland; Happy Valley, 

Labrador, and Frobisher    

 Bay, Baffin Island. Even Canada's overseas north-em em goals were included with especially significant visits to Nuuk, Greenland, and Reykjavik,  Iceland. 
   Baha'i communities throughout

Central and South America  

 as well as the Island communities in the Caribbean have also enjoyed the bounty of visits from the Hands of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha 

Rtihfyyih Khanum, John     
Robarts, 'All-Muhammad     
Varq~, Dhikru'LHh Khadem   

 and Paul Haney. Mr. Haney represented the Universal House of Justice at the 

Intercontinental Conference
in Quito, Ecuador.         

 Touching, indeed, was the constant assistance of the Hand of the Cause William Sears to the U.S. Baha Community in rallying the friends to provide the resources to Launch the first North American Baha'i radio station, WLGJ, located at the Louis 

G. Gregory Baha'i Institute
in Hemingway, South Carolina.

 The inaugural broadcast is expected to be made in 1984. 
                           
Continental Board of Counsellors

 Alaskans rejoiced at the appointment to the 

Continental Board of Counsellors

 of Lauretta King, a Tlingit and first Native Counsellor in 

North America.             

 The Baha community of Panama was honoured in January 1981 by receiving all sixteen members of the Continental Board of Counsellors for its historic first plenary meeting following the consolidation of three Boards into one. The meeting was further enhanced by the presence of the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha R6hiyyih Kh6nurn and Mr. Hooper Dunbar of the 

International Teaching Centre.

 Since that time there has been a steady stream of Counsellors through the Americas nurturing, encouraging and stimulating the friends. 

 The changes in the institution of the Continental  Boards of Counsellors which placed the United States community within the sphere of influence of the Board for all the Americas were to register their immediate positive effects when, in August 1981, ten members of the newly constituted sixteen-member Board of Counsellors came together with members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States for the inaugural consultations of these two institutions. They were joined, for part of the time, by several members of the

178                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The Local Spiritual Assembly of Chucuito, Puno, Peru; 1981. 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Canada. The Counsellors, through their own travels, do all they can to keep the vision of the Faith before the friends. 

 The effective work of Auxiliary Board members and their assistants with the committees  and agencies of National 

Spiritual Assemblies     

 has been responsible in large measure for the achievement of local community goals. For example, in Falc6n State, Venezuela, such close collaboration of the Regional Teaching 

Committee with Auxiliary  

 Board members, native Baha'i teachers and pioneers yielded excellent results. The number of Local Spiritual Assemblies grew from five to eight, then nine and twelve. A number of teaching campaigns were held in the State. 

 In Mene de Mauroa, a six-consecutive-weekend campaign was held and the Baha'i population reached 228 believers in that town. Previously, a weekend proclamation activity was held in the local theatre with good attendance. Afterwards, a children's conference was successfully carried out, and well-organized consolidation activities  have begun with the new believers of Mene de Mauroa. 

 The Counsellors have effectively championed  spiritual enrichment for Baha'i communities.  Moreover, through their Auxiliary Boards more consistent emphasis has been placed on individuals using the Creative Word to transform their characters. 

 This matter has also been placed in the forefront of courses at Baha'i schools, conferences and institutes. 

 c.  ASIA In his message to the Baha'i world; dated October 1953, the beloved Guardian referred to the continent of Asia as K the cradle of the principal religions of mankind; the home of so many of the oldest and mightiest civilizations which have flourished on this planet; the crossways of so many kindreds and races; the battleground of so many peoples and nations; above whose horizons, in modem times, the suns of two independent revelations  — the pTomise and consummation of a six-thousand-year-old religious cycle — have successively arisen; where the Authors of both of these revelations suffered banishment and died; within whose confines the Centre of a divinely-appointed Covenant was born, endured a forty-year incarceration and passed away; on whose western extremity the

180                 THIS BAHA'I WORLD

  of the Baha'i world has been definitely established; in whose heart the city proclaimed by Baha'u'llah as the "Mother of the World" is enshrined; within whose borders another city regarded as "the cynosure of an adoring world" and the scene of the greatest and most glorious revelation the world has witnessed is embosomed; on whose soil so many saints, heroes and martyrs, associated with both of these revelations, have Lived, struggled and died. 

 This vast continent is now the scene of unparalleled expansion of the Faith and prodigious  receptivity to the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 Asia, the worM's largest continent, with more than half of the world's population, is also proud of having more than half of the Baha'i population of the worM. 

Of the 25,121 Local Spiritual

 Assemblies in the world, 13,174 are in Asia; and, of a total of 113,111 localities where Baha'is reside, Asia alone has 55,273. 

 Among the innumerable important achievements which have been recorded during the period under review, the following may be cited as particularly outstanding: the development of innovative measures for the Baha'i education of children and of specialized educational  curricula for tribes; increased participation  of women in all Baha'i activities; exemplary dedication of Baha'i youth to teaching the Faith and to active participation in projects relating to economic and social development; and the largest incr&ase in the number of Chinese embracing the Faith of Baha'u'llah in any period. 

 The friends in the Arabian countries of Western Asia and in Afghanistan are restricted  in their activities. 

 They are, however, a shining example of fortitude and of adherence to the Baha'i way of life. On many occasions they have generously contributed towards the achievement of goals in international fields. 

 The events in Ir6n, the sacrifices of the friends in that cradle of the Faith, the martyrdom of so many holy and steadfast souls have been and continue to be a source of inspiration, a vitalizing force and an assurance of confirmation to all those who arise to teach and serve the Cause. A detailed report on the persecutions appears elsewhere in this volume of the international record. 

 Indonesia is another country where organized ized Baha'i activities are banned and some of the friends who taught the Faith on an individual basis are now in prison. 

 In India, the Faith has spread among people of all shades and castes, women and children, the young and the old, the privileged and disadvantaged. 

 The first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar for the whole of the Asian continent is being built in India. The phrase 'Unto our Lord, are we building the Temple' is heard on all lips. 

 Almost every day a conference, deepening class or a Summer or Winter school is held in some part of India. 

 Here are found the largest Baha tribal communities. 

 The Baha'i Academy of India, established and developed through close cooperation between the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 and the Continental Board of Counsellors, promises to be an outstanding institution for the higher study of the Teachings. 

 Among the most exciting developments that are taking place in India is the establishment of educational institutions all over the country, including tutorial schools, primary schools and colleges. 
Notable among these are the

New Era School, the Rabbani
School, the Institute      

 of Rural Technology and the Rural Development 

Programme. Unquestionably 

 these institutions are invested with potentiality for becoming powerful instruments for the expansion and consolidation of the Faith in India. 

 Realizing that the status of women in India is very low, partly because of their lack of education and skills to become gainfu1~y self-employed, a rural Women's Vocational Training  Institute was established in Indore where Baha'i women from nearby villages are trained in simple skills such as soap-making, candlemaking and chalk-making to name but three. 

 Bangladesh has successfully achieved aH its goals. 

 Women's activities there are of high quality and play a significant role in Baha'i community life. 

 Coordinated by the National Baha'i Women's Committee, deepening dasses and conferences are organized for both Baha'i and non-Bahh'f women. The youth also are very active and have their own newsletter. 

 The historic achievement of obtaining official recognition of the Faith by the authorities is among the outstanding accomplishments of the 

Baha'is of Pakistan.       

 Some of the other noteworthy achievements of this community


<p181>

  INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES

 are the sustained and collective efforts to mobilize Baha'i youth in the service of their Faith, the holding of successful Summer and Winter Schools, and the unprecedented increase in the number of teaching conferences. 

 Activities in Burma, a country which has one of the oldest Baha'i communities in the world, have been for a long time and still continue to be subject to strict control by the authorities. 

 These restrictions are general and not specifically directed against the activities of Baha'is. 

 However, the efforts of the friends to promote cordial relations with people in authority, and their attempt to explain to them the principles of the Faith and the loyalty of the friends to their government, paved the way for the implementation of some teaching and consolidation projects leading to a remarkable increase in such activities and the revitalization of the community in general. 

 The prestige of the Tadong Baha'i School is largely responsible for the continued growth of the Faith not only in Sikkim but in other Himalayan States including Darjeeling and Kalimpong. The government officials in these areas are friends of the Faith and attend Baha'i annual functions by hundreds. 

 The authorities are cooperative in all respects. 

These Himalayan States     

 have populations of various religious backgrounds and the Tadong School has Tibetan, Lepcha, Bliutia and Indian students. 

 A number of Baha'i tutorial schools have been established. 

 The women in these Himalayan States often take a leading part in general Baha'i activities and in projects relating to social development. 

     The Spiritual Assembly     

 of the Baha'is of Nepal was reestablished in 1982. Cordial relations exist with officials and dignitaries. The Cause of God is progressing smoothly and satisfactorily. 

 The Baha'i community of Sri Lanka has come through many difficult times and has survived tests and trials as well as hardship resulting from the political disturbances that have afflicted this beautiful island. 

 In terms of systematic expansion and consolidation, the period 1979 — 1983 may be considered  one of the most productive in the history  of the Faith in Thailand. The continued development and maturity of the National Spiritual Assembly has been a notable feature of the progress of the Faith in this country. An outstanding accomplishment has been the acceptance of the Faith by hundreds of Indochinese in the refugee camps and the Some Baha'is of the Dang tribe, Gu]arat, India; 1982.

  establishment of a strong 

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 in Phanat Nikhom Refugee Camp in northeast Thailand. 

 Another significant development was the handing over to the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Thailand      

 of a multipurpose educational complex, called the Santitham Vithayakam School, established by Mrs. Shirin Fozdar. 

 Situated in the Province of Yasothon with approximately sixty Local Spiritual Assemblies in dose proximity, this complex has the potential to serve as the centre of soclo-economic development projects. 

 During the period under review the most significant development in Laos was the programme  of recovering 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 lost previously due to political disturbances. 

 Through the concerted efforts of the National Teaching Committee and dedicated  individuals, the National Assembly was able to recover twenty Local Assemblies during the second phase of the Seven Year Plan. In spite of restrictions on travelling within the country the community of the Most Great Name organized well-attended, livein teaching conferences in Vientiane. The good relations, mutual trust and respect maintained by the National Assembly with the authorities in Laos is one of the most meritorious achievements of the Baha'is in that country. 

 The Baha'i community of Malaysia has continued to progress. There are two disparate communities in East and West Malaysia and each has different aspects of development. 

 East Malaysia has a large rural community with hundreds of localities. Many of the villages have good Baha'i communities which hold 

Assembly meetings, Nineteen

 Day Feasts, children's classes and women's abtivities. Women are the mainstay of community activities.  They organized several women's conferences and, together with the youth, are doing communal farming. East Malaysia is exemplary in the holding of large numbers of regional teaching conferences, youth conferences, women's conferences, children's classes and teachers' conferences. 

 In West Malaysia, as a result of government rezoning, the number of Local Assemblies has been altered. The believers in the cities, towns and estates have all-B ahA'i activities for community and individual development. 

 Conferences  and courses for youth, as well as classes for women and children, are held all over the Peninsula. The Faith gained better recognition when the community was invited to send representatives to participate in a prayer session for peace and unity held on Armed Forces' Day. Baha'i marriages have legal recognition and numerous Baha'i Assistant Registrars have been appointed by the government to conduct marriages. 

 In East Malaysia, also, native believers who are not covered by this marriage law seek to marry according to Baha'i procedure. 

 Malaysian Baha'is, acting on the instructions  of the National Spiritual Assembly, have undertaken a new project to donate blood during the Muslim month of Fasting during which Muslims are not available as blood donors. Baha'i communities all over Malaysia have been quite successful and their activities have been accorded good publicity. 

 Baha'i correspondence courses are issued in four languages with lessons geared to meet the needs of beginners, advanced students, Local Assembly members and children. 

Summer and Winter Schools 

 are held in different parts of the country, and recently Summer Schools conducted in Tamil and Chinese have been held regularly. 

 The continued mobilization of Baha'i youth for participation in expansion and consolidation; the successful conferences and Summer and Winter Schools which have been held; the increasing participation of women in Baha'i acfivities; the satisfactory increase in the use of the press, radio and television for the proclamation of the Faith; and the translation and publication of literature in local languages are among the noteworthy achievements of the Baha'is of Korea. 

 The small dynamic community of Singapore has recently bought its own new National Centre. 

 Singapore has sent travelling teachers to the Philippines, Thailand, Burma and India. 

 Its contributions to the Baha'i Funds, international and national, are very liberal. 

 In spite of the fact that some of the pioneers had to leave the Philippines, this community resolved to carry on resolutely to win the goals of the Plan and increase the members' knowledge  of the Teachings. They have established successful tutorial schools under most difficult conditions and have established for themselves an excellent reputation with the authorities. This latter point is illustrated by the fact that

 the Baha'is of Baguio City were invited by the city government to participate in its campaign against drug addiction because it recognized that Baha'is are positive in their approach to their fellow men and can thus effectively promote unity. As part of this campaign the Baha'is will visit more than one hundred villages or baum gays where they will work mostly with youth. 

 The valiant community of Japan has done excellent work in the teaching and administrative  fields, has been successful in increasing the number of believers and has prepared for the formation of several new Local 

Spiritual Assemblies.      

 The friends there have, in an organized manner, brought to the attention of members of parliament and government officials the situation of the 

Baha in Ir6n.            

 The prospects are bright for the progress of the 

Faith in Taiwan. There     

 is a great deal of Baha'i activity, increases in the numbers of believers are anticipated, and plans have been laid for a countrywide teaching project. Further, the Publishing Trust is gaining in strength and has produced two beautiful new prayer books in Chinese, one a regular prayer book attractively printed and bound, and a second, designed for children, with Chinese and English texts. Relations between the Baha'i community and the authorities are very cordial. 

 Two members of the Taipei community  are employed by the English-language radio station, one as manager and the other as newscaster. 

 The Bab's of the world gaze expectantly at Asia whose peoples have shown such marked receptivity to the Teachings of Baha'u'llah and where, when the true nature of the Baha'i Revelation is understood and its followers Are free to promulgate its life-giving, spiritual principles, great benefits will result.

  nition that by living the life and working in accord with Baha'i principles we shall better prepare ourselves for the next stage in the development of the Faith. With a new spirit pervading the community — a spirit released through the sufferings of our brothers and sisters in frAn — we witness results in teaching amongst Aboriginal peoples, joint projects between National Assemblies, circulation of travelling teachers and pioneers, and a greater use of radio and television. As the Faith has emerged from relative obscurity, the National Assemblies, especially in countries where the Faith has been long established, have acquired a new confidence in their approach to the authorities which has resulted in strengthening the prestige of the Faith. 

 In the continental perspective, the collaboration between the Board of Counsellors and National Spiritual Assemblies has developed progressively, whilst the Baha'i International Community has continued to cement relations With the South Pacific Commission. 

 The Australasian continental zone was increased  in November 1980 by the addition of four Central Pacific island countries — the Caroline Islands, Hawaiian Islands, Marshall Islands and the Mariana Islands — all with existing 

National Spiritual Assemblies.

 The new total of fourteen National Assemblies was increased by one with the formation during Ridvan 1981 of the National Spiritual Assembly of TuvaLu, a small, newly-emerged independent State of on!y 7,357 people living within the island group and an estimated 1,700 living elsewhere. 
The community has grown impressively.

 The expansion in Tuvalu has been matched by that in only three other Pacific island areas: Vanuatu saw mass entry on the island of Tanna, and Tonga and the Mariana Islands have enjoyed steady expansion. 

 Most other island communities were unable to maintain and consolidate the unusual successes  of the Five Year Plan. Efforts at consolidation were either insufficient or hampered  by the difficulties of travel. Sometimes circumstances beyond the control of pioneers made it impossible for them to remain at their posts. Thus the indigenous Polynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian believers have had to shoulder increasingly responsibilities that previously were carried out by the pioneers. 

 There has been a heartening effort by these fine believers to improve the quality of their Baha'i lives and to assume initiative in teaching and administrative activities. 
  The French areas of New   

Caledonia and Loyalty     

 Islands, as well as French Polynesia, suffered many setbacks as did the Caroline Islands and Fiji. Even Kiribati, which during the Five Year Plan achieved resounding successes,  fell back considerably. But in all these areas determined efforts are being made to improve the situation. 

 During the entire period the sufferings of the dear, courageous friends in IrAn have been constantly in the thoughts and prayers of the believers. Through the efforts of the National Spiritual Assemblies these persecutions have been brought to the attention of the authorities. In Australia and Fiji this led to resolutions being passed in their parliaments. 

 Media coverage has increased in all places. Proclamation and the establishment of cordial relations with officials and leaders of thought has continued throughout the zone. 

 As usual, Hawaii has met with particular success in activities of this kind and has initiated imaginative  measures. 

 In almost all areas the determination to vindicate the sufferings of the believers in the Cradle of the Faith has shown itself in the increased confidence with which the friends are arising to commit themselves anew to service. Australia and New Zealand have witnessed a steady growth in numbers and an unprecedented degree of community development. 

Their Local Assemblies    

 are maturing, evidenced by their increased ability to more effectively handle extension teaching proj ects and the administrative affairs of the Faith. Development of Baha'i scholarship was fostered  in this period to an unprecedented degree. 

 There has been an increase in the number of Baha'i Summer Schools that were held and greater attention was devoted to the translation of the Revealed Word. 

 There have been new and outstanding strides taken amongst 

Aboriginals in Australia  
and the Maoris in New     

Zealand. In Papua New     

 Guinea, a country of some three million inhabitants, the community has recently rallied itself to gain 114 of the 140 Local Assemblies required in the Plan. It is interesting to note that more declarations resulted from the correspondence course than from any other form of


<p186>
186                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  teaching. A dramatic effort in consolidation of this large stream of new believers featured a visit of a team by helicopter to the Mountain Brown area. 

 Fiji has seen revived success amongst its large Indian population. Recent teaching efforts in the Marianas resulted in attracting many Filipinos and some indigenous Chamorro believers. 

 There has been spontaneous teaching on distant islands: a Local Spiritual Assembly has been established on Tikopia, a small ~dot' of an island in the Eastern Solomons some 500 miles across the sea from the capital of Honiara, and in the Carolines the distant atoll of Satawal now has a group which includes a Chief. 

 A highlight of this period was the Baha'i International Conference held in Canberra, the capital of Australia, attended by 2,400 believers from forty-five countries of both Asia and Australasia. 

The Australian National Spiritual

 Assembly skilfully planned and implemented  this outstanding conference commemorating  the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest HcAy Leaf. The Hand of the Cause Dr. Ugo Giachery, representing the Universal House of Justice, by his very presence provided a spiritual force recognized by all. Our own beloved Hand of the Cause, Collis Featherstone, Led a spirited twoway telephone linkup with the more than 9,000 Baha'is assembled at the Montreal Conference.  Dr. Giachery, in a telex sent to the World Centre, described this as UNPRECEDENTED  SUCCESS 

OF ANY CONFERENCE EVER     

 ATI7EN-DED  and noted that it MAKES ME HIGHLY 

HOPEFUL  OP GREAT DURABLE 
ACHIEVEMENTS ALL REGIONS   
BETWEEN POLES AXIS WITHIN. 
BRIEF TIME.                

 The conference placed in focus the spiritual axis linking Australia and Japan, an axis which the beloved Guardian described as 'extending from the Antipodes to the northern islands of the Pacific, an axis whose northern and southern poles will act as powerful magnets, endowed with exceptional spiritual potency'. 

     The Continental Board      

 of Counsellors was reconstituted on 3 November 1980 with the Hawaiian Islands and Micronesia added to its previous zone. Our gratitude and appreciation go to the three retiring Counsellors who gave years of outstanding and devoted service during which they travelled, often in difficult circumstances, all over this vast expanse of ocean. 

 Two of these — Howard Harwood and Thelma Perks — had served from the inception of the Board in 1968; and the third, Violet Hoebnke, since May 1973. The remaining three members — Mr. Suhayl 'A1&f, Mr. Owen Battrick and Dr. Peter Khan — welcomed the appointment of three new members: Mr. Ben Ayala of the Hawaiian Islands, Mrs. Tinai Hancock of 

New Zealand and Mr. Lisiate Maka

 of Tonga. Counsellor Richard Benson was transferred from the former Northeast Asian Board to this zone, making the seventh member. The number of Auxiliary Board members was increased from forty-five to sixty-three to serve the enlarged zone. This period has been one in which the devoted efforts of 'these precious souls — the Auxiliary Board members and their assistants — ' have contributed markedly to the strengthening of the fabric of the Cause. 

 There has been continuing improvement in the collaboration between the institutions of the Board of Counsellors and the National Spiritual Assemblies as well as between the Auxiliary Board members and the 

Local Assemblies. This     

 collaboration and the resulting  effort has enhanced the deepening of the believers in their understanding of the principles  and teachings of the Faith. Nineteen Day Feasts are better attended and are of higher calibre, and children's classes have grown and improved as have all Local community activities. Pioneer effort and the movement of travelling teachers have increased within the continental zone and several National Assemblies have participated in joint projects. For example, there has been an exchange of travelling teachers between the Solomons and Vanuatu, between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and a teaching project by Australia and Japan in 

Micronesia. Australia      

 and New Zealand have taken measures to revive the magazine Herald of the 

South.                     

 Noticeable throughout the period has been the greater degree of participation of women, and more recently of youth. Women are making their presence and their value felt at the very foundation of the community, in child training and family life. The youth are coming to the forefront in teaching activities and are often the initiators of development projects in the area.

  The eyes of the friends have been turning expectantly to Western Samoa where the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is now rising upon a beautiful hillside in Apia. Despite difficulties and delays the work has progressed steadily throughout the period and the dedication is anticipated some time in 1984. 

     The Baha'i International   

 Community has continued to be represented each year at the South Pacific 

Commission Conference      
by Counsellor Tinai Hancock.

 She is accompanied on each occasion by an alternate representative  chosen from among the local believers in each venue of the conference. 

 In January 1923 the beloved Guardian referred to the Pacific Islands in delightful terms: their very names evoke within us so high a sense of hope and admiration that the passing of time and the vicissitudes of life can never weaken or remove.' As this brief survey goes to press, we who serve in that area, already blessed by the presence of the first reigning monarch to espouse the Faith, soon to be further blessed with a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar on a Pacific Island, and finding ourselves linked by this 'spiritual axis' with another area of great potential, can but have a feeling of wonder as we sense the forces of the Army of Light being challenged, tempered and strengthened for tasks that will test us further.

  reverberated throughout this continent. The National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 led their communities in protest against this blatant religious  discrimination and cruel violation of human rights. Their actions were coordinated by the European Office of the 

Baha'i International     
Community in Geneva.      

 Supportive response came from international,  national and local levels, as well as from governments, cabinet ministers and from ecclesiastical circles. 

 Most outstanding have been the resolutions of the Parliament and of the Council of Europe; the resolutions passed on two occasions by the Parliament of the European Economic Community; the debates in the British House of Lords; the resolutions of the German Bundestag and the Parliament of the Netherlands; and the wholehearted support of representatives of European governments of d~marches and of the resolutions put forward in sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, meeting in Geneva. In 

Switzerland, the Federation

 of Protestant Churches issued a report on the plight of the Persian Baha'is. 

 In England, the Dean of Canterbury participated in the ceremony  when a tree was planted within the precincts of Canterbury Cathedral as a living memorial to the martyrs, the site marked by a plaque reading 'In memory of the Persian Baha'is who gave their lives foi God'. The heads of Oxford Colleges registered their feelings  on two occasions by signing statements protesting against the continuing persecutions. 

 It is impossible in this brief summary to mention all the national and local publicity accorded the Faith through the mass media in Europe as a result of its persecution in IrAn. O.utstanding have been articles in Le Monde, The Times, The 

Guardian, Frankfurter     

 All-gemeine  Zeitung and Neue Zz2rcher Zeitung, national radio and press publicity in Northern Ireland, and the response in the French-speaking countries of Europe lo the book Le& Baha'is, ou Victoire sur Ia Violence by Mrs. Christine Samandari (n&) Hakim and in the United 

Kingdom to Iran's Secret  
Pogrom by Dr. Geoffrey    

 Nash. A typical example of the quantity of press coverage devoted on the local level to the persecution of the Iranian Baha'is is the 1,110 column centimetres which appeared in the year 1982 — 1983 in the press of East Lothian, 

Scotland.                 

 The sacrifices of the Baha'is of lr~n have proclaimed the Faith continuously throughout this continent. 

 Much of the energy of the Baha communities, nationally and locally, has been channelled into these activities. This of itself has brought new experience and has had a unifying and consolidating effect on the communities. 

 At the same time, many Baha'is have come to Europe from frdn as part of the worldwide dispersal which resulted from the persecutions in their native land. 

 This has presented both a challenge and an opportunity to Baha communities, already diversified, to achieve integration of east and west on an unprecedented scale. A not unusual example of 'unity in diversity' is found in one of Norway's Local Spiritual Assemblies, whose nine members are of five different nationalities. 

 One of the most far-reaching developments occurred in November 1980 when the Universal  House of Justice increased from five to nine the membership of the Continental Board of Counsellors for Europe. 

 The greater personal contact thus made possible served to strengthen the relationship between the Counsellors and the National Spiritual Assemblies  and, through the Auxiliary Board members and their assistants, also strengthened re1atio~ships with the Local Spiritual Assemblies  and local communities. The cooperation achieved between these two major pillars of the Baha'i Faith has had a profound effect upon every aspect of Baha activity. 

 The composition of Baha'i communities themselves has gradually changed. 

 Baha'i children have grown into youth and an increase in the number of young married couples has given a new meaning to Baha family life. This in turn has brought a new awareness of the role of the Local 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 in their relationships to children, youth and families, as well as to the older believers. In every country there has been a sustained interest in studying the Baha Writings for 'guidance concerning the family and the spiritual  education of children and youth. 

 There is constant effort to develop joyous, dynamic and well-oriented Baha communities that can triumph over the debilitating influences of a sceptical and materialistic environment. 

 Each national community has held Summer and Winter Schools regularly; Germany, 

Italy


<p190>
190                THE BAHA I WORLD

  and the United Kingdom have held several each year in different parts of their respective countries. 

 With programmes of ever-increasing value and interest, the wonderful spirit of each of these Schools has attracted a growing number of participants from other countries. Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which previously  joined together for these activities, held independent Summer Schools for the first time in 1979, and each has gone from strength to strength in the development of their 

Summer and Winter Schools.

 A need became apparent for special provision for the growing number of children attending national and regional gatherings. The Baha'is of the Netherlands took the lead in conducting children's classes of particular excellence at such functions in their country. Children's 

Summer Schools and Summer Camps

 are held in several countries, notably Germany and France, where they are firmly established. 

 Teaching conferences, seminars, institutes, weekend and one-day schools have been held in every country and have called for a greater number of Baha teachers. In Denmark and Iceland, in particular, successful weekend teacher-training programmes have been conducted  for the past several years. 

 In four countries the national communities joyously reported that their growth has been such as to require their obtaining larger national 

Ilaziratn'1-Quds. New     

 administrative headquarters of increased capacities have been acquiTed in 

Norway, the Republic      
of he-land,  France and   

Luxembourg. The National Spiritual
Assembly of Switzerland   

 administers the excellent 'Landegg Conference Centre' for Baha'i purposes. It is situated in the northeast of the country and promises to develop into a study centre serving all Europe. 

 Scotland (which has its own legal system) and Denmark have joined those countries where Baha marriages, conducted by Baha'is, are legally recognized. 

 Links with the United Nations have been strengthened through the celebration of Human Rights Day and United Nations Day, as well as through the hoMing of special events in support of UNICEF and UNESCO. The Baha community of Denmark actively participated in the United Nations 

International Women's     

 Conference heM in Copenhagen in 1980, and in 1982 itself organized a special Women's 

Seminar.                  
     The fourth European Youth 

 Conference, held from 6 to 10 September 1980 at Fiesch, Switzerland, was attended by three Counsellors  and more than 900 young Baha'is from every country in Western Europe and many other parts of the world. Strengthened by the experience of shared learning and social interaction in the spiritual and joyous atmosphere  of the conference, the youth dispersed to serve with energy and enthusiasm in the Seven Year Plan. 

 Their eagerness to undertake 'border teaching' — one of the international goals of the Plan in Europe — continues to bear fruit. 

 Among other cooperative activities, two 'North 

Sea Border Conferences'   

 were held, with friends from Belgium, the Netherlands and the east coast of England participating. Switzerland, Austria and Germany joined in a successful 'B odensee Proclamation Project'. Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands support activity in the newly-opened German-speaking  area of Belgium. Fiffland and Sweden continue to work together in the Aland Islands. And the Baha'is in the far north of Norway, Sweden and Finland cooperate 'horizontally' across those three areas in Lapland. There are strong links between Northern Ireland and the Irish 

Republic. France and Switzerland
work together, as do Italy,

Corsicaand Sardinia;      

 and Cyprus works with both Greece and Turkey, especially in the field of publishing. In the 

Basque region, France     
and Spain cooperate.     

 Nine travelling teachers from Iceland have visited Greenland where the teaching work is steadily developing through the aid of the Danish Baha'i community which has offered additional support by sending pioneers, travelling teachers and visitors. 

The first Local Spiritual 
Assembly in Greenland     

 was established  in the capital city, Nuuk, at Ridvan 1979. Eleven young Greenlanders have accepted the Faith since the much-appreciated visit there of Abdu'l-Baha 

R6hiyyih KlPnum in September

 1982. Greenland is an example of intercontinentM cooperation: the Baha'i community of Canada has the goal of assisting in its development, and geographically it is part of the area of the Counsellors of the Americas who themselves — and through their

  Auxiliary Board members and assistants — are constantly in touch with the friends there. Both the American and the European Counsellors work with and give practical support to the National Spiritual Assembly of Denmark in its work in 

Greenland.                
   Numerous Local Spiritual  

 Assemblies were formed in earlier Plans in the islands around Europe's coastline. In the summer of 1981 Amatu'I-BahA R6ljiyyih KMnum brought joy to the friends in some of the northern islands when she visited Mull, the Outer Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetlands. She made a number of visits to Cyprus. In 1982, while visiting Europe, the Hand of the Cause Collis Feather-stone  visited the Baltic island of Bornholm which is one of those in which a Local Assembly is to be formed during the Seven Year Plan. An outstanding 'island victory' is the development of the Canary Islands, part of the Baha'i community of Spain, whose progress by Ridvan 1982 had led them to the threshold of the establishment of their own National 

Spiritual Assembly.       
Responsibility for Malta  

 was transferred from the National Spiritual Assembly of the United Kingdom to that of Italy at Ridvan 1980. 

     European Counsellors      

 have made a point of visiting and maintaining close contact with the island Baha'i communities from the North Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea and they have also supported the work of National Spiritual Assemblies and their committees by making a special effort to keep in touch with the more isolated communities in each country, both through their personal travels and through the work of the Auxiliary Board members and their assistants. 

 The teaching work and the ensuing deepening and consolidation is conducted in sixteen different 

European Languages.       

 This gives rise to a constant need for translation and publication  of the Holy Writings, as well as all manner of other books and deepening material. Some notable recent publications are the first book in 

Luxembourgian, a Baha'i   

 prayer book; Gleanings from the Writings of 

Baha'u'llah,  A Synopsis

 and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas and Some Answered Questions in Dutch; a compilation of Baha'i prayers, The 

Hidden Words and Some     

 Answered Questions  in Greek; Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah in Swedish; a compilation of Writings of the Central Figures in Icelandic; and a book about the life of• Baha'u'llah E6varb T. J6nsson, the first Baha'i book to be written in Icelandic; and the first introductory  book translated into Faroese, 

The Baha'i Faith by Gloria

 In 1981 Switzerland commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of its famous scientist and humanitarian, Professor August Forel, one of the earliest 

Swiss Baha'is. The Swiss  

 Baha'i community recalled his association with the Baha'i Faith by producing and dedicating to him a special issue of its magazine La Pensk Baha'i. A doctoral dissertation by John Paul Vader entitled For the Good of Mankind: August Forel and the Baha'i Faith written on that occasion received an award from the University of Lausanne in Professor 

Ford's native Canton      
of Vaud.                  

 Europe has many personal links with 'Abdu'l-Baha Who visited the continent in 1911 and again in 

1913. In 1983 the Baha  

 of Austria celebrated the seventieth anniversary of 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit to Vienna by republishing 

Maria von Meymayer's      

 drama Qurratu'1-'Ayn and distributing it to prominent persons and institutions throughout the country. In the United Kingdom, Baha'i youth journeyed by train, as 

'Abdu'l-Baha Himself      

 had done, from London to Edinburgh, to join the Scots Baha'is in their observance of the seventieth anniversary of the Master's visit to the Scottish capital. 

 The celebration began with the welcoming  skirT of bagpipes as the train drew into Waverley Station and it continued on a joyous note for the whole weekend. 

 Portugal is one of the Baha'i communities which has enjoyed outstanding success with general proclamation activities in the form of newspaper articles, exhibitions and television programmes. 

 The Baha'i community of the Republic of Ireland, already outstanding for its devotion to the Cause, the services of its pioneers on the homefront and abroad, and for the loving enthusiasm of its travelling teachers, befittingly  organized and welcomed the International 

Conference in Dublin      

 in June 1982. It was attended by 1,900 Baha'is from sixty countries. 

 This conference was one of a total of five convened by the Universal House of Justice and dedicated to the memory of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the fiftieth anniversary of

  whose passing it commemorated. 

 It was the high point of the four years under review. 

 The message from the House of Justice to the conference gave a new direction to the European Baha'i community. It called upon the Continental Board of Counsellors to consult with every National Spiritual Assembly in Europe and 'together, launch such a campaign of spiritualization and personal teaching, as has never been witnessed in your continent'. It urged that 'the Baha community in every country in Europe stand out as a beacon light'. After describing Europe's response to Christianity as the development 'through many vicissitudes' of 'the most widespread and effective civilization known', the message outlined the task of the Baha as that of arousing in the people of Europe a more magnificent response to the Teachings of Baha'u'llah 'than was ever made by the divided and contending peoples of olden times'. In a continent where there has developed among the populace a revulsion against religion and where there has been a powerful growth of materialism, this task is not an easy one, but it now animates and activates the European Baha communities and will undoubtedly inspire them to unprecedented efforts.

       2. THE ASSOCIATION FOR BAHA'I STUDIES
                     1979 — 1983

                   GERALD FILSON

  I N 1974 the Universal House of Justice called upon the Canadian Baha'i community to 'cultivate opportunities for formal presentations,  courses and lectureships on the 

Baha'i Faith in Canadian  

 universities and other institutions of higher learning'. 

 Following a policy conference, the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada established the Canadian Association for Studies on the Baha'i Faith. It was felt that the Association would provide a suitable means of approach to intellectuals and universities and bring to these circles an awareness of the Faith and an acquaintance with the academic resources which are available  to facilitate formal study of it. From 1974 to 1979 four annual meetings were held. The Association grew in membership, published a series of high quality monographs, initiated work on a textbook on th& Faith of university calibre and stimulated formal presentations at universities and colleges throughout 

Canada.                   

 In the period Ridvan 1979 to Ridvan 1982 the Association for Baha'i Studies has played an increasingly important role in the affairs of the international Baha community and through its conferences and publications has provided an exciting forum for intellectual and spiritual development. 

 The change of name which was recommended by the 

Canadian National Assembly 

 and approved by the Universal House of Justice in April 1981 reflected the emerging nature of the Association's membership and activities with national affiliates established in a number of countries. Its executive committee  included, for the first time, members from the United States as well as Canada. Serving on the current Executive 

Committee are Hossain     

 Danesh, Glen: Eyford, Richard Gagnon, Jane Goldstone, 

William Hatcher, Douglas  
Martin, Peter Morgan,     

Nasser Sabet and Christine
Zerbinis, of Canada.      

Firuz Kazemzadeh and Dorothy

 Nelson serve as liaison officers in the United 

States.                   

 The Association has constantly received invaluable and reassuring support, guidance and assistance from the Universal House of Justice and has enjoyed the participation and encouragement of the Hands of the Cause and members of the Continental Boards of Counsellors.  It has also derived benefit from the spiritual and intellectual contributions of members of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the United States and 

Canada.                   

 Highlights during the period under review — a period of transition from a Canadian to an international association — have included the opening of a modest but beautiful Centre for Baha Studies, the first such centre in the Baha world, at the heart of the University of Ottawa's campus in Canada's national capital; the holding of three annual conferences, two special theme conferences and several regional conferences; continued excellence in the standard  of publications produced by the Association; and the launching of an affiliated organization, the Baha'i International Health Agency, which began operations in July 1982 with Dr. Ethel Martens (researcher, social and preventive medicine) serving as executive secretary. 

 In 1979 the Universal     

 House of Justice gave a further goal to the Canadian community for the Seven Year Plan: 'Expand the opportunities  for teaching in Canadian institutions of higher learning and further develop the Canadian 

Association for Studies   
on the Baha'i Faith.'     

 And in 1981, when the second phase of the Seven Year Plan was launched, the 

Universal House of Justice

 restated this goal and divided it into two parts: 'Foster the development of the Canadian Association for Studies on the Baha'i Faith' and 'Expand and intensify the teaching of the Faith in Canadian institutions of higher learning.' 

 The goal of cultivating opportunities for formal presentations and courses remained a primary objective of the Association, but the Universal House of Justice also encouraged specific attention to the development of the Association itself. 

 The Association had become a significant feature of the intellectual, social and spiritual life of the Canadian community, and for increasing numbers of Baha worldwide.

  The fifth, sixth and seventh annual conferences  held in 1980, 1981 and 1982 were creative and stimulating events. All three were held in Ottawa — at the University of Ottawa in 1980 and 1981 and at the Chateau Laurier in 1982. Approximately three hundred Baha and guests attended in 1980 and 1981 while more than six hundred and fifty enjoyed the presentatibns and discussions at the 1982 gathering held a week prior to the International  Baha'i 

Conference in Montreal.    

 The fifth annual conference inaugurated an annual memorial lecture in honour of the Hand of the Cause Hasan M. Baha'i who died in February 1980. The Hand of the Cause of God John A. Robarts, Dr. 'Abbas AfnAn, Dr. Muhammad 

Afn4n and Mr. Douglas      

 Martin spoke at that conference on the life and work of Mr. Baha'i. 

 Mr. Douglas Martin and Mr. Glenford Mitchell, secretaries of the National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 of Canada and the United States, respectively, made a joint presentation for the memorial lecture in 1981. Mrs. Gayle Morrison, whose To Move the World: Louis G. Gregory and the Advancement of Racial Unity in America appeared in 1982 to critical acclaim, speaking on the life of the Hand of the Cause Louis Gregory, gave the Hasan M. Baha'i lecture at the 1982 conference. 

 Another new feature, begun at the fifth conference and continued at subsequent conferences, was the presentation of Association contest awards for best essay by a highschool student, best essay. 

 by a university student and best individual research paper. 

     The first Baha International

 Conference on Health and Healing, organized by the Association, was held immediately following the fifth annual conference. 

 It brought together  Baha'i health professionals and their fellow Baha'is to discuss health in the light of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah and contemporary scientific thinking. 

The Hand of the Cause John 

 A. Robarts inspired and encouraged conference participants and closed the historic gathering by delivering an address on the unity of science and religion. 

 The sixth annual conference was also graced with the presence of a Hand of the Cause of God. Abdu'l-Baha Rhhfyyih KLThnum gave the opening and closing addresses at the International Conference on Marriage and Family Life which immediately followed the annual conference of 1981. 

 The seventh annual conference, held from 30 August to 2 September 1982, served to emphasize the growing international dimension of the Association. 

 Many of the unprecedented number of participants who crowded into the beautiful ChAteau Laurier ballroom came from a number of countries outside Canada. 'The Baha'i Option', theme of the conference, examined solutions offered by Baha'u'llah to many contemporary problems confronting mankind. Human rights, personal and social values, justice, economics, telecommunications, workshops and symposia on scholarship, Baha'i curricula and health were all included on the conference programme. 

 A full day was devoted to a discussion of international development. 

 Two other features are now characteristic of the Association's conferences. 

 First is the degree to which they reflect the importance in Baha'u'llah's Revelation of music and the arts. Presentations of the arts were not auxiliary  to the main programme but are viewed as being as essential to the conferences as the lectures and discussions. 

 The second feature, which relates closely to the original aim of the Association, is the inclusion on the programmes  of wellknown figures from outside the Baha community, a concrete demonstration  of the success the Association is enjoying in bringing to leaders of thought an awareness of the Faith and helping raise the prestige of the Faith through fostering cordial re1ationshi~s with leading intellectuals and scholars. Dr. Jean-Ren6 Milot, Professor at the University of Montreal, spoke at the 1980 conference; Mrs. Yoshiko Nomura, Executive Director of the Lifelong Integrated Education Centre in Japan, made a presentation at the gathering in 1981; and Mr. Lewis Perinbam, Vice-President Special Programmes Branch of the Canadian International Development Agency, addressed the conference participants in 1982. These guest speakers were favourably impressed by the quality of the conferences. Indications are that future invitations to speak at conferences of the Association  will be well received, a sign of the emerging importance of the kind of forum for scholarship and study which the Association provides.

  In addition to the emerging international activities of the Association, regional conference  committees were established which held nine regional conferences in the period from 1979 to 1981. The conference held in Quebec was noteworthy in that it was the first Association  conference to be conducted entirely in French. A further development was the sponsorship  by the Association of sessions at Baha'i schools in the United States. One hundred and fifty participants attended the threeday 

Green Acre Baha School   

 and the Bosch Baha'i School sessions of the Association in 1981. There were similar sessions at these two Baha schools in 1982 and 1983, and additional sessions at the Louhelen 

Baha'i School.            

 By 1983 three regional conference committees were functioning in Canada and three in the United States: Pacific Northwest, Saskatoon  and Quebec, in Canada; and California, Midwestern 

United States and New     

 England in the U.S.A. The publishing work of the Association expanded in the period under review with volumes 6 to 11 of Baha'i Studies being produced. 

Volume 6, The Violence-Free

 Society:  A Gift for our Children, by Dr. Iziossain B. Danesh, was reprinted (30,000 copies) and provided a focus for a number of regional and local proclamation programmes and conferences  in Canada. 

 A translation into French of volume 6 appeared as volume 8. Volumes 7 and 9, Response to the Revelation: Poetry by Baha'is, by Dr. Geoffrey Nash, et aL, and The Concept of Manifestation in the Baha'i Writings, by Mr. Juan Ricardo Cole, were followed in 1982 by volume 10, a collection of articles on creativity by Dr. Baha'i Naj4jjav6ni, Dr. Geoffrey Nash and Mr. Otto Donald Rogers, and a selection of poems by Mr. Roger White in homage to Emily Dickinson taken from his full-length work One Bird, One Cage, One Flight. Volume 2, The Science of Religion, by Dr. William S. Hatcher, was also reprinted. Finally, volume 11, The Concept of Spirituality, by Dr. William S. Hatcher, was published in 1982. 

 A new venture for the Association was the publication of Baha'i Studies Notebook. 

 This publication presented in an attractive format the presentations made at some of the conferences: the April 1981 issue focused on health and the March 1983 issue on marriage and ~ family. 

The first Baha'i Studies  

 Notebook brought together poetry and essays on the Faith, and an issue on international development was in the final stages of publication in 1983. 
These two publications,   

Baha'i Studies and Baha'i 

 Studies Notebook, have gerved to demonstrate the power of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah to illuminate contemporary problems and issues. They provide valuable resources  for the important work of expanding and intensifying the teaching of the Faith in institutions of higher learning. 

 Another important effort of the Association has been the sponsoring of formal presentations at universities and colleges in both Canada and the United States. The universities of Ottawa, Western Ontario, McMaster, McGill, Simon Fraser, Ohio State, Concorcija and 

Quebec (at Montreal)      

 are some of the universities which have had formal ~presen-tations  by Baha'i speakers on behalf of the Association. Members of the Association spoke at university teaching hospitals and at a variety of conferences and seminars including the World Congress of Mental Health in Salzburg, 

Austria, in July 1979     

 and the Governor's Conference on Child Abuse in Nevada, in 1980. In May 1983 Association members will participate in the Third 

Annual Symposium on Religion

 in the Modern World and will represent the Baha'i Faith at the 'Woridview 1984' Conference of the 

World Future Society.     

 These formal presentations represent important  first steps towards the day when Baha'i courses will be available at institutions of higher learning. Two initiatives in this specific area are worth noting: in 1980 the University of Toronto sponsored a non-credit course on the Baha'i Faith and, in that same year, the 

University of British     
Columbia's Continuing     
Education Department      

 offered a full semester course on the Faith. 

 As of Rid½n 1983 these various activities of the 

Association for Baha'i    

 Studies promise to accelerate in intensity with increasing significance  for the intellectual and learned circles of society still unaware of or barely acquainted with the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. With the Centre for Baha'i Studies well established and providing accommodation for the secretariat, a reference library and the affiliated Baha'i

  International Health Agency, with computerization of much of the Association's administrative  and publishing work and, finally, with its international aspects expanding, the Association for Baha'i Studies looks forward to rapid and exciting developments. Indeed, the Universal House of Justice confirmed the hopes and expectations of the Association's members and supporters in letters written on its behalf to the Association from which the following excerpts are taken: 'The efflorescence of the Association for Baha'i Studies has been, in the eyes of the House of Justice, one of the very favourable outcomes of the Five Year Plan and bodes well for the maturation and eminence of the Canadian community.' (19 March 1979) 'We are asked to convey its [the Univers~1 House of Justice'sI commendation to the Association for the steadily increasing scope of its interests, for its expanding membership and for the valuable stimulus it is providing particularly to the North American Baha community.' (24 

November 1982)             
     'The House of Justice      

 is very pleased with the way in which the Association has been developing, and will pray at the Sacred Threshold for divine confirmations to surround  its work.'

    3.    THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TIlE BAHA'I
      INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AGENCY

  MIORE than fifty Baha'is who are health professionals in Canada, the United States and Chile were present in Ottawa, Canada, on 10 — 11 April 1982 when the 

Baha'i International     

 Health Agency was formally established.  The creation of such an agency was recommended at the first Baha'i International Conference on Health and Healing held in Ottawa in June 1980 under the sponsorship of the Association for Baha'i Studies. The Hand of the Cause of God John A. Robarts was among those present at the April 1982 meeting  which also was sponsored by the 

Association  for Baha'i  
Studies. Participants      

 included medical doctors, nurses, counsellors, therapists, psychologists, social workers and medical students. 

 The proposal to create the agency was accepted by the executive committee of the Association for Baha'i Studies, approved in principle by the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada and referred to the Universal House of Justice for its guidance. 

 In approving  the creation of a Baha'i International Health Agency, the House of Justice stated: 'The idea of a special group of I3ah&i health professionals is a useful one, and for the time being it is quite sufficient to develop it as a section within the Association The agency was established with a view to coordinating and encouraging research and education among Baha who are health professionals and others who are interested or who have knowledge in this area. The agency could well prove to be of assistance in helping to place Baha'i health professionals in pioneering  posts around the world. 

 Goals of the agency, as proposed in 1980 and confirmed at the April 1982 policy conference,  include compiling a world directory of Baha who work in health-related professions,  scientists and resources; organizing an international Baha conference on health to be held every three years; publishing the proceedings of these conferences; and developing and distributing educational health programmes for children and adults in various countries and cultures. These programmes will be made available in written and audiovisual form for use by Baha'i radio stations, Baha'i schools, Spiritual Assemblies and non-Bah~t'f  entities.

  4. BAHA'I SCHOLARSHIP IN AUSTRALIA

 1979 — 1983 'BAHA'I scholarship is of great importance  in the development and consolidation of the Baha'i community,' the Universal House of Justice stated in its message entitled 'The Challenge and Promise of Baha'i Scholarship',  published in The Baha'i World, volume XVII, p. 195. Among the goals given to the Austrahan Baha'i community in the Seven Year Plan were: to foster a deeper understanding of the Baha Writings; to make efforts to have the Faith presented in courses at schools, colleges and universities; and to encourage Baha'is to devise means of proclaiming the Faith to professional people. 
 With the approval of the   

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Australia, a conference on Babfl scholarship — the first of its kind to be held in this country — was organized by the Baha'i Society of the University of Tasmania. 

 More than one hundred believers from many parts of Australia gathered at YeTrinbool 

Baha School in New South  

 Wales from 9 to 12 April 1982 to discuss the emerging role of Baha'i scholarship, its service to the individual and the Faith and its relation to scholarship in the non-Bah&i world. 

 Counsellor Peter Khan presented a keynote address in which he surveyed the Writings of the Faith on Baha'i scholarship. This was followed by the presentation of papers on a wide variety of topics which correlated aspects of the Baha'i teachings with recent developments in physics, biology, medicine, psychology  and educational theory. Papers discussing recent developments in music and art, from the perspective of the Baha'i teachings, were supplemented by historical papers dealing with the lives of Mark Tobey and Juliet Thompson. An outstanding presentation by Dr. Baha Forghani, on the Life of Mirza Abu'1-Fadi,  the illustrious Persian Baha'i scholar who taught in the United States at the turn of the century, provided new insights into an exemplary life of devotion and true scholarship.  Described by Shoghi Effendi in God Passes By as a 'learned apologist', Mirza Abu'I-Fadl was the author of The Baha'i Proofs, The Brilliant Proof, the Fard'id and other imponant works. 

 Pr should be noted that in addition to speakers academically trained in their fields, participants in the programme included non-academics  who were also intrigued by their subject matter and who evinced a healthy zeal in researching their topics for presentation. 

 There were three dominant features of this conference. 

 All speakers used the authoritative  Writings of the Faith as a standard and a framework for their scholarship and creativity; there was an admirable spirit of tolerance and respect for differing understandings  and approaches within that framework; and, overall, the entire atmosphere was one of encouragement and support, with cooperation and modesty replacing the competitiveness, arrogance and pride which often characterize contemporary scholarly meetings. 

 A second conference on Baha'i Studies was held from 1 to 4 April 1983, again at Yerrin-bool,  and again there were more than one hundred in attendance. 

 The presentations touched on many aspects of human affairs. Three main categories of scholarly papers were offered: 

    (1) Studies of Scripture   

 which brought understanding of some of the deeper aspects of the revealed 

Word.                      

 (2) Studies of the relationship between the Baha Faith and contemporary society and the way in which the principles and teachings of the Faith may be applied to resolve presentday social problems. 

 (3) Historical papers which provided a deeper insight into the lives and characters of the early Baha'is from whose example presentday believers may derive inspiration. 

 There were three invited addresses: Dr. 

Merdad Meshgin, 'Mishkin-Qalam:
His Life                   
and Work'; Counsellor Peter

Khan, 'Further             
Considerations of Baha'i   

 Scholarship'; and Mr. James Heggie, 'The Early Days of the 

Baha Faith in Australia'. 

 A feature of this conference was the holding of the first Australian Festival of Baha'i

  Artists. Mr. Phillip Hinton delighted the audience with his masterful renditions of poems and Mr. Cliff Stevens performed guitar selections. 

 Scholarship has a high station in the Baha'i teachings, as the Universal House of Justice has reminded us. Baha'i scholars who are well-versed in the Teachings, who uphold the Covenant, and who are guided by tact and wisdom and humbled by knowledge of their responsibilities will contribute greatly to upholding  the dignity and honour of scholarship.

FROM 1977 until 1980 the   

Departments of Religious   

 Studies and of Sociology at the University of Lancaster lent their support to a succession of four annual 

Baha'i Studies Seminars    
(16 — 17 April 1977; 15 — 16   
April 1978; 7 — 8 April 1979;

 11 — 13 April 1980) held under the convenership of Peter Smith, then a postgraduate student in the Department of Sociology. Designed to further academic research into the B~bf and Baha'i religions, these seminars afforded opportunity for a number of postgraduates from Europe and America to present and discuss papers on various aspects of 'Baha'i Studies'. Most of the substantive papers presented at the seminars have since found their way into print or have been incorporated into the participants' doctoral theses. 

 The papers presented were as follows:

        6. THE DEVELOPMENT OF BAHA'I SCHOOLS
             DURING THE SEVEN YEAR PLAN
                  BARBARA BARRETT

  Baha'u'llah hath become manifest to educate all of the peoples of the world. He is the Universal Educator whether of the rich or the poor, whether of black or white, or of peoples from east or west, or north or south. 'Abdu'l-Baha There are certain pillars which have been established as the unshakable supports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is learning and the use of the mind, the expansion of consciousness, and the insight into the realities of the universe and the hidden mysteries of Almighty God. 'Abdu'l-Baha A SMARTLY-DRESSED, white-gloved squad of boys and girls carrying the banner of 'Colegio Nur', marches in a municipal parade before government authorities in Santiago, Chile; A smalL group of three to five year-old tots in Lomaivuna, Fiji, gather for prayers, manners and moral training at the town's Baha'i Center; Boys and girls of a primary school in rural India, in a village of Uttar Pradesh, meet on the steps of a Hindu temple or under the welcome shade of a spreading banyan tree; A Swazi kindergarten child arrives at Hiati-kula preschool for a pleasant day in a structured  environment with thirty other youngsters; While in Chuquisaca in the Bolivian Andes, campesinos wrapped snugly in their handwoven woven woolens against the biting mountain air, throng to a newly-opened Tutorial Center seeking basic education (for children) and literacy classes (for adults). 

 Continents apart, separated by culture, language and experience, they all share a common value and are moved by one impulse — the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. 
All attend Baha'i schools.

 The 'Baha'i school' eludes a single definition. Though the schools have much in common, they are as different as the circumstances that gave them birth. 

 They are as varied as the nations that hold them, the cultures that infuse them, the servants that create them and the wondrous range of children and adults who attend them. They represent the response to the mandate of Baha'u'llah to bend your minds and wills to Students of the New Era Schoo4 Panchgani, Maharashtra State, India.

  the education of the peoples and kindreds of the earth and the injunction of 'Abdu'l-Baha to exert every effort to educate the children. They are the answer to the instruction of the Universal House of Justice in its messages of RiQv~n 136 (and even earlier) to 'encourage Local 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 to establish Baha tutorial schools where needed and feasible' or to 'continue to develop your Baha'i schools and establish Baha'i tutorial classes where needed.' 

 By Ridvan of 1983, functioning tutorial schools, founded in response to that call, totalled one hundred and forty-three; thirty-eight  were in Africa, thirtyfive in the Americas, sixty-nine in Asia and one in Australasia. 

 The numbers change almost daily as Assemblies in scores of villages and towns, and a few cities, act vigorously to carry out the mandate of universal education embodied in the Teachings of their 

Faith.                     

 The 'tutorial school' is a Baha creation. 

 It is a nonformal village school, perhaps with a physical structure — a simple shelter or adobe-brick building — and perhaps not; perhaps with a single teacher, certified or not, paid or unpaid, or partially reimbursed in kind (which may be foods and provisions or labor on his land); or perhaps staffed by a volunteer youth who has been schooled in a city, or by a parent or other literate villager. 

 Its aim is to give rural children basic education to the degree possible with the resources at hand. This may sometimes mean supplementing public education, where this exists, with special tutoring in additional subjects such as English; or it may mean adding Baha'i content to the educational experience with classes based on the Teachings. 

 It will usually mean both —  basic education with some classes that are specifically related to the Teachings of the Faith. It is not everywhere possible to make rigid distinctions as to service of children or adults, as to day or night operation, as to basic education or literacy as primary goal, since some facilities and staffs are operated in more than one way, and are used to accomplish more than one objective. And it is not always possible to make a sharp distinction between the tutorial school and the academic institution, as the former has sometimes evolved into the latter, acquiring permanency, a physi

  cal plant and professional teachers. In some cases, a next step has been certification by the government, and in a few, adoption into the public system of education. 

 The academic institutions are older in Baha'i history, and fewer in number than the mushrooming tutorial schools springing up during the current Plan. Some outstanding examples of Baha educational efforts predate  the Seven Year Plan Message of 1979, and are embodied in formal academic institutions and housed in their own permanent and expanding facilities, indicating, perhaps, the direction that some of the recently founded tutorial schools will take in the course of their development. 

 The following section discusses some countries' early experiences in founding Baha'i schools and their subsequent development  of tutorial schools.

District, Uganda; August   
1981.                      

 I The first schools founded by Baha'is came in the lifetime of 'Abdu'l-Baha when He urged the believers of tr~n and 'JshqTh6xI, Turkistan, to found academic schools for both boys and girls. 

 The famed Tarbfyat Schools were the result. Their success over decades is well known in Iran and to Baha'is around the world. They continued until fanaticism and repression closed them down. 
                           
Uganda                     

 Two Baha primary schools named for the Hand of the Cause Louis Gregory were established in 1961 at Odusai and Tilling in Tororo and Kumi Districts, due to generous contributions for the purpose by Mr. and Mrs. Rafi Mottahedeh. 

 These schools, too, were affected by changing governmental policies. The Ministry of Education took over all curricula and teaching in formerly private institutions and religious schools. 

 The ownership  and physical maintenance of the two Baha'i schools remain, however, in the hands of the institutions of the Faith, as does the teaching of the Baha religion classes. The institutions of the Faith and the Baha'i parents continue to take a keen and sustained interest in the progress and development of the schools. 

         In 1957, a German-born     

 pioneer from the British Isles, Miss Claire Gung, termed by the Guardian 'The Mother of Africa', opened the first interracial kindergarten in Uganda near the historic palace of the Kabakas of Buganda at Mengo, Kampala. 

 The school rapidly came to be one of the most respected pie-primary institutions in Uganda, eventually reaching an enrollment of some one hundred and ninety children of all races and backgrounds, including  the children of many distinguished Ugandan  families. 

 During the early years of the second decade of its existence, Auntie Claire's Kindergarten was transferred from its original somewhat humble quarters into a large new building entirely planned and constructed through the personal efforts and sacrifices of 'Auntie' Claire herself. Ownership and administration was transferred, in part, to the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Uganda. Through

 the long, perilous years of political and social upheaval in Uganda, from 1971 to the present, Claire Gung stayed and persevered at her pioneer post, running her school though advancing age and ill health weighed heavily upon her. Though the trying restrictions of life in Uganda at present have reduced the numbers of parents able to provide kindergarten education for their children, the school remains  open and Auntie Claire continues to win the love and respect of the Baha'is and the people of Kampala in general for her selfless

   The New Era School in     

Panchgani, Maha-rashtra   

 State, dates from 1945 when it was opened as a small children's hostel. 

 It has become an international school of stature with a student population of more than four hundred coming from twenty nations. 

 Half are from Baha'i families and the remainder are from Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim or other backgrounds. 'New Era' now consists of a preschool, primary and secondary schools, and a small Junior College. Computer programming has recently been added to the curriculum. Public service projects have become  a feature of the secondary school program. 

 Other educational and development institutions have emerged from New Era, and its destiny is to include a fullyfledged University,  as envisaged by Shoghi Effendi.1 In 

1982 the Baha'i Youth     

 Academy was created on the New Era campus to hold short courses of intensive study on a high academic level throughout the year for special groups of youth selected on the basis of common interests. 

 One of the first sessions was for children of Persian pioneers living in India, another was for women, another for young men graduating from the Rabbani 

School. By May 1983 the Academy

 had held four separate sessions of several weeks each, from its opening in July 1982. A separate physical plant for the Youth Academy will soon be erected on a site in Kanga Hills which will include a complex of classrooms, a conference hail, library, offices, dormitories and dining room for sixty students. 

 The same site will also hold the New Era Junior 

College.                  

 Mention should be made here of the Rab-bani  School, a higher secondary school for village boys in Gwalior, in the state of Madhya

 An English-medium school, the Glory School, has been established since February 1981 in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, a place made famous by Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel Prize laureate and most renowned of India's men of letters. 

To Shantiniketan, where Tagore's

 home is maintained as a museum, and where his original school has expanded into a great university, students are attracted from all parts of the world. For these reasons, and for the strong Baha'i associations with Shantiniketan? the first Local Spiritual Assembly  elected there in 1979 determined to open a Baha'i school. When the Glory School opened its doors in February 1981 the organizers  received a message of encouragement from the Universal House of Justice. In 1983 a hostel was inaugurated to attract children from other places, some of them Baha'is whose parents wished their children to have this experience. Glory operates a nursery, kindergarten and Classes I and II; its goal is to reach Class XII. The school has been self-supporting  from the beginning but now seeks funding to acquire land for a permanent site, and for subsidizing more children in the boarding school. 

 A number of smaller schools in India include two in Andhra Pradesh in southeast India — another 

Glory English School      

 and the Shoghi Children's Convent. Both are privately owned and run by Baha. The 

Glory School of Andhra    

 Pradesh offers courses from lower kindergarten to fifth standard. The kindergarten  through first standard are in the English medium, the fifth standard in Telugu only. Students are from very poor areas and unable to pay regular fees, thus the school has to have outside support. The Shoghi School has an enrollment of one hundred and ninety-four children in ten classes, Standards One through Five in the Telugu medium, and Kindergarten to 

Standard Three in English.

 The principal, Mr. G. Samba Siva Rao, and five teachers are Baha'is. 

 In 1983 the school is earning eighty-In In Tagore's lifetime the Hand of the Cause of God Martha Root visited there. She stayed three days, left many books in the University library and in conversation with Tagore expressed the hope that a chair for study of the Baha'i Faith would be established at Visva-Bharati University. 

 The Hand of the Cause of God Dorothy Baker also visited Shantiniketan for a week. During the Ten 

Year Crusade Mr. Hushnnnd

Andhra Pradesh, the Carmel 

 Baha'i school at Ravikampadu is run by Mr. Rambabu, an assistant to the Auxiliary Board, who teaches forty students in Standards I and LI. His previous tutorial class in this village has grown into a Baha'i school. The Anis School, opened in mid1983, has an enrollment of sixty-seven and is increasing steadily.

 India will have two hundred and twenty functioning tutorial schools by 1984. 

 At mid1983  there were fifty-two in being and many more in process. 

 In the state of Uttar Pradesh alone, there were thirteen schools in existence and funding provided for forty more. They are supervised by the State Baha'i School 

Corn-mittee                

 mittee of Uttar Pradesh, and they are expected to become self-sufficient in the next three years. 

The National Spiritual     

 Assembly gives the strongest possible support to the fostering of tutorial schools by all State Committees. While education is compulsory in India by the law of the land, not every village school is scrupulously kept open, and not every teacher is as dedicated as the law might prescribe. In some villages, the Baha'i schools provide the only source of education for all children, accommodating between eighty and a hundred  children. The Baha'i teacher is dedicated and sincere, receives training on what and how to teach in the usual school curriculum, and what Baha'i moral and ethical teachings to impart. 

 Women are being appointed to the school committees of the villages and are happy about their improved status. School attendance by girls is strongly promoted by the Baha'is. 

 In the tutorial schools the school day usually begins with a prayer. 

 The tutorials in general take the children through sixth standard, after which they are sent to the nearest town to a district school. 

 A Counsellor of the Continental Board in Asia has pointed out that the village children have been quick to memorize Baha prayers and songs, and quick to learn Baha'i history and principles. 

 She has expressed the optimistic  conviction that 'Through their Baha'i education, it should be possible to eliminate caste and religious prejudice which has permeated  the very core of Indian society.'

  Bliutan and India, is flushed with success. 

 A new school building will begin this year to house more than two hundred students who have been meeting since 1975 in the Baha'i Center of Jaigaon. The school is one of those which began as tutorial efforts in the early 70s. It now has eight teachers and adds a new class every year. It was founded by pioneer from India, R. C. Gupta. 
                          
Indonesia                 

 Since 1970 pioneers to Indonesia have. operated a 'Dar6t-Tarbiyyih' or 'House of Education' for Indonesian children, with the encouragement of the Universal House of Justice. It started modestly, as a kind of youth hostel or ashram for Baha'i children from the Mentawai Islands. 

 A Persian pioneer, Mine. 'Ismat (Esmat) Vahdatj was the first to undertake the care of the young Indonesian children in her home, moving from her post in Java to Padang to do so. She supervised the care of the twelve-year-old sister of a Javanese pioneer to Mentawai, enabling the girl to attend school in Padang. The same year, a young Persian medical student from Djakarta, Manoochehr Tahmasebian, came to join Mime. Vahdat in developing the hostel. Four young boys from Siberut were brought to Padang to live, and the ashram began to expand. 

 A third staff member joined the hostel in 1972 when Miss Navanita Sundram, a sociology graduate of Singapore University, mated Tabmasebian. They undertook to provide a homelike setting  where children from one of the poorest and most primitive areas of the world could benefit from education in Padang schools and receive a Baha'i education 'at home'. A loving but structured environment was created within  the pioneers' own home. Social and personal  needs of the Mentawai children were met, skills were taught, self-reliance was encouraged.  They were enabled to earn pocket money by the practice of a variety of skills and crafts taught in the hostel. Their academic education in Padang schools has proved successful,  with some going onjo higher education or technical schools. Three of the first four children who arrived in 1970 now attend high school and university, but still live in and participate in the hostel. Another is in his I See 'In Memoriam', p. 743. 

 second year of medical studies, the first student from Mentawai ever to be admitted to a Medical Faculty. He has married a girl who is a 'graduate' of the Asrama (as the hostel is called in Padang), and together they manage another unit of the hostel. 

 The purpose of the Asrama was, and still is, the 'spiritual growth of the whole of Indonesia', as stated by the Universal House of Justice in its original approval of the project. The immediate objective was to consolidate the rapid growth of the Faith that had taken place in the Mentawai Islands during  the 195 Os when the late Hand of the 

Cause Dr. Rahrnatu'11Th   
MulPjir was a pioneer and 

Government Medical Officer

 in these islands. Mass teaching began there in 1953 when Dr. MuhAjir arrived, a Knight of Baha'u'llah  for Mentawai, and by 1956, 6,000 of the 12,000 people of Siberut Island had become Baha. 

 Twenty schools were established, one in each village. Javanese teachers, supported by the Regional Spiritual Assembly and, later, the National Spiritual Assembly, effectively gave general and Baha education. 

 When the Faith was banned in Indonesia in 1962, there were twenty-five 

Local Assemblies  in Mentawai.

 As the precious gains made at such cost during the previous decade began to recede the Baha'is felt impelled to offer education to Mentawai children. 

 They began to think in terms of 'adopting' Baha'i children of Siberut, one of the most backward areas of Indonesia, sponsoring their education in nearby Padang and raising them in their homes as Baha'is. 

 In 1968 — 1969, plans were formulated, approved by the Universal House of Justice, and the hostel was born. 

 By 1980 there were twenty-four Mentawai children and two small children of the pioneers  making up the Asrama community and it was necessary to expand beyond the physical limits of the Tahmasebians' household. At that time a small house was acquired in Nan-gab,  a suburb of Padang, and five children ranging in age from six to twelve were brought from the islands. In 1982 land was purchased in another suburb and a third Asrama was built by the Baha'is. 

 The 'architect' who drex'Q the plans was an Asrama boy who was a graduate of 

Technical High School.    

 Even the small children of the pioneers helped in digging and preparing the foundation. The

  third in the series of hostels opened its doors without fanfare in July 1982, with another young woman 'graduate' of the original As-rama  in charge of a group of small boys from eight to ten years. It was tangible evidence of success of the hostel concept and of the vision of those who had given years of love and sacrifice to its development. By the end of 1982 the children and youth in the three hostels numbered forty-six (three of them the children born to the founding pioneer couple and raised as full participants in the daily life of the hostel). 

 Though the ashrams were never regarded as schools, the education given the children during the past fourteen years — academic social and spiritual — could never have been realized in any other way. The Asramas of Padang qualify, therefore, as one of the most innovative and valid experiences of the Baha'i educational spectrum. 
                           
Sikkim                     

 The Baha'i School at Tadong, Gangtok, enjoys great prestige and is an important factor in the spread of the Faith, not only in Sikkim, but in the other Himalayan states. The school's students are from a variety of religious backgrounds, reflecting the population of the Himalayan region. 
They are Tibetan and Indian,

Lepcha and Bhutia. Tadong  

 was founded by pioneers from India, in 1975. Its original enrollment was twenty-five  students. 

 Today five hundred and sixty-two  students are enrolled in classes, and a number of them are also boarding in a hostel. A new five-story building for the school is under construction, providing space as well for the offices of the National 

Spiritual Assembly. The    
school now includes Nursery through

Standard VI. Courses       

 will be increased by adding one level each year, through Secondary.

Chile                      

 Colegio MTh in La Cisterna, Chile, a suburb  of Santiago, is a Bah&i-owned, Balil'i-administered, state-supported school begun in March 1978. But it has its roots in the 1960s, with the initiative of Mrs. Silvia San Crist6bal, an educator, who gradually rallied the support of other Baha'i teachers and the Santiago community. 

 By May of 1975, after months of careful study, the Local Assembly had approved  a project to operate an already existing colegio (school) and presented the idea to the National Assembly. 

 The National Assembly, in tan, consulted the 

Continental Board of Counsellors

 and, after their careful study, sent the proposal for consideration to the Universal 

House of Justice. This     

 proposal was the first of its kind in the occident, according to its Director, Carlos Rivera San Crist6bal, who calls it the 'Mother of Educational Work in 

Chile'.                    

 The first stage in this project of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly of La Cisterna    

 was to operate a school already in being and recognized,  Colegio Integral, which offered primary school and the first year of secondary. On 21 January 

1976 the National Spiritual

 Assembly received a telex from the Universal House of Justice, appToving their officially administering a c6legio and offering a monthly sum toward rent, fees and expenses. On 

1 March the Liceo Integral 

 began activities which would Later give rise to Colegio N6r. With an enrollment of seventy-one pupils and Mrs. San Crist~5ba1 as Director, and with nine other Baha'is on the teaching staff, the Liceo began slowly to develop as a model for 

Baha'i education. All      

 the teachers were employed in state schools and gave a half-day to the Liceo without salary or any remuneration for their work. They continued in this way for five years. 

 During its first year of operation the Baha Colegio received visits from Counsellors,  National Assembly members, and traveling  teachers. In July of 1976 a letter from the Universal House of Justice expressed warm approval of the venture and offered prayers for its success. In 1978 the Supreme Body encouraged the National Assembly to continue  with the Baha'i school and approved the purchase of a property of its own, contributing an initial sum toward that end. 

 After an intensive search of the entire Commune for an appropriate facility, Colegio N~T began classes on 15 March 1978 at its present location, in La Cisterna, with a student body of sixty-six. 

 Application was made to the Ministry of Education for accreditation.  Many of the Baha'i friends rallied round the new effort, and during 1979 the student population grew to ninety-two and the curriculum increased by the addition of the Students of Cole gio Nit, La Cisterna, Santiago, Chile, in parade formation; 1983. 

  second year of high school. 

 Efforts were continued to obtain official recognition from the state. In December of 1979 the School became fully accredited by official decree of the Ministry of Education. The years 1980 —  1981 were years of great progress, with the constant support of all the Baha'i institutions and the dedicated efforts of a group of Baha'is who were determined the work would succeed.  Two new classrooms were constructed; the third year of secondary was added; and the decree of Cooperador de Ia Funci6n Docente was obtained from the government. An administrative council was named by the National Spiritual Assembly to take responsibility for the school's Baha'i content, religion classes and some administrative aspects. In 1981 the Colegic applied for state funding which was granted. From June of that year, for the first time, with state subvention, the Baha teachers began to receive some pay for their work. 

 The faculty consisted then of thirty-nine teachers, fourteen of them Baha'is. 

 The final year of secondary was added, completing the school's academic structure. 

 Another significant achievement of 1981 was a decree of the Ministry of Educa

 tion permitting the suspension of classes on Baha'i Holy 

Days.                      

 Three hundred and fifty students are distributed among fifteen courses. 

 About twenty percent of them are Baha. The majority come from large and low-income families. About eighty percent continue their education at the school year after year in spite of their families sometimes moving to other neighborhoods. 

 The teachers have said they feel that the reason for their pupils' great attachment to the school is the atmosphere of love that pervades it. It seems also to be transmitted to the families of the students. A remarkable percentage of parents participate regularly in parents' meetings, not to criticize, as is all too common, but to cooperate and offer help. 

 Religious instruction, in accordance with the teachings of the Baha'i Faith, is one of the items of the curriculum of Niir school. One hour weekly is devoted to classes on progressive  revelation, the history of religion and the principles of the Faith, adapted to various levels of learning. The school council has indicated that the religion classes should be related to the Social Science classes, drawing historical parallels, pointing out relationships, etc. The teachers' purpose must also be to infuse spiritual values into the course work, to strive for character formation and development of good habits. The teachings of the Faith imparted should be focused on the realities of the students' daily lives. 

 Many improvements in the physical plant and equipment continue to be made, and the community supports the development of the school. 

 New gardens, new baths and facilities for physical education are some recent gains, and future plans call for many more basic renovation and expansion items, as permitted. The school is eighty percent financially self-sufficient. 

 In addition to its early achievement of an urban school, the Chilean Baha'i community was among the first in the hemisphere to enter decisively into providing formal education for its rural Baha'i population. 

 The origin of the rural schools was the attempt to fulfill the goal of tutorial schools given to many countries in the Five Year Plan. As the Baha'is tried to establish such nonformal schools, consulting with the institutions of the Faith, the idea slowly arose, 'Why not formal schools in villages as well?' With the background of experience of Colegio Niir, the possibility of government subsidy, and other proffered financial help the National Assembly resolved to open the first rural educational institution, the A. 0. Faizi School.' 

 It is in its fourth year of operation at Loncopulle, a small Mapuche Indian village in the province of Cautin. The majority of the villagers are Baha'is, as are the majority of the seventy to eighty children who attend the school. It offers basic education, grades one through eight and held its first eighth grade graduation in 1983. 

Its Director, Miss Consuelo

 Mufioz, is a homefront pioneer,  and member of the National Spiritual Assembly, who went to live among the Baha of Loncopulle, with her husband, Jorge Mufioz. They are assisted by two other teachers in the unselfish effort to bring basic education to the area of greatest concentration of Baha'i population. 

 The location was chosen because of the receptivity to the Faith on the part of the Mapuches of Cautin 

Province. The MuhAjir      

 School2 at Bollilco, also in the Mapuche area of Region IX, was inaugurated in November of 1981. It serves a similar population and is similarly staffed by homefront pioneers. Miss Loreto Jara was its first director and teacher; she is now assisted by other Baha'i volunteers. 

 By 1983, in its third year of operation, Mirza School was serving about fifty children, grades one through five. In addition, there was literacy training for adults and some horticultural programs were undertaken. 

 A private charitable foundation has chosen the MuhAjir School as a center for some cooperative activities with surrounding farmers. 

 Both rural schools have been officially recognized by the government and benefit from state subsidy for operating expenses. 

 For their buildings, for improvements, equipment and materials they depend on the Baha'i Fund, on gifts from individuals, and even from Local Assemblies in the United States. Here, as in Santiago, staff members say, the distinguishing feature of these village schools is an atmosphere of love. For example, none of the teachers in other schools of the region have ever been successful in getting the Named after the Hand of the Cause Abu'1-Q6sim Faizi. 2 Named after the

  children to read and sing in Mapuche, the language they speak in their homes. 

 In both Baha'i schools this has been achieved with ease. School — community relationships are extremely warm. 

 Current goals toward which Chile's schools, both rural and urban, are working might be stated as 'learning to function' as Baha'i schools. As explained by a member of the Continental Board of Counsellors in the Americas, this means putting the official curriculum in practice with an acceptable level of administrative organization, establishing the daily routine of regular classes and educational activities and infusing it all with the presence of the Faith, mainly by creating an atmosphere of love and spirituality. 

 To date the Faith is taught oniy at a very basic level in the religion class of the official curriculum. The Counsellor observes, however, the impressive  results of the presence of the Faith in education even at this minimal level, and anticipates eagerly the fruits of a totally Baha'i educational system as it gradually unfolds in Chile and elsewhere. 

 He posits a long-range goal of 'development of content and methods for Baha moral education leading to a true change of behavior in students activities that include the school and its classrooms, the home, and the continuous education of the teachers.'

  In 1963 the Santitham      

 School was established in Yasothon for children of farms and villages in the northeast. Mrs. Shirin Fozdar who was associated with the school from its inception, began to solicit support for its expansion in 1981. 

 Construction of a commodious new building began in March 1982. Much outside support, government and private, has been enlisted. 

The Santitham School       

 is now the property of the National Spiritual Assembly. 

 It operates kindergarten and pre-primary  classes, and is beginning to offer courses in business and commercial subjects. Secondary school has been suspended during construction work. 

  In Phattalung Province     

 of south Thailand a community reading center and library was opened in October 1982, in a pleasant building constructed in the open and airy local style. 

 It serves for meetings of the Thung Muang Kwang 

Baha community. Also      

 in the same province a child education center was opened in 1983 in the Khuan Khreo Center, a building erected by an all-out community effort.

Haiti                      
     The Anis Zuniizi School    

 in Lilavoix, near Port-au-Prince is a primary school for rural children which began its first classes in 1980, after a two-year period of preparation and construction. The cost of the facility, named after the young martyred companion of the Rib, was provided by a Baha'i family of Belgium. 

 The School was formally dedicated in October 1982 in a ceremony presided over by Abdu'l-Baha Riihiyyih Kh6num and attended  by many high notabilities of the Haitian Government, including a special representative of the President. Six hundred people witnessed the historic event, among them three members of the Continental Board of Counsellors in the Americas and all the members of the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Haiti. Other   

 eminent visitors were: the Ambassador of Canada, the Directors General of the Ministries of Education and Vocational Training, members of Parliament, the mayor and other officials of nearby Lilavoix. 

 Classes are from kindergarten through elementary  levels, with plans for later expansion. The next phase will add a variety of trade and vocational courses for older students and adults. 

 A village leadership program brings local youth to be trained as tutors and to return to their villages to set up classes in basic reading, writing and trade skills. The program is designed to obviate the all-too-common pattern of trained youth leaving their needy villages, rather than putting their new skills into use there. 

 A conscious effort is made to counter this tendency. 

 As a part of the school's curriculum, regular classes in religion are held weekly. 

 They include lessons on all the major religions of the world, taught from a Baha'i perspective. 

 In addition, there is a Baha'i children's class each Sunday afternoon and an adult deepening class once each week. These are taught by Mrs. Mattie Thimm, the wife of the Headmaster, who also teaches three Baha'i children's classes a week in villages near the school. 

 An extension program is a cooperative effort of the National Assemblies of Haiti and Canada. Their aim is to enlist ten to fifteen trainees who will teach in three-to-five preschool  and family education centers in selected  villages. This is made possible by a grant from the Canadian International Development  Agency through the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. It is expected that the school will become a resource center to improve the educational lot of the people of the whole area, its programs and activities benefiting many. 

 Zurnizi School affords an interesting example of international cooperation in a project  which will have a strong impact on Haitian education well into the future. A Persian Baha'i architect designed the modern complex; a Texas-based artist designed a glazed tile mural for the central courtyard; a Haitian stone mason trained the laborers and built some of the walls; a mechanical engineer from Canada was job supervisor; an Englishman  was in charge of cost control and supervision. The school's principal is German-born; his wife, who teaches English and kindergarten, is an American. (They are Mr. Hans-Jtirgen Thimm and Mrs. Mattie Thimm.) 

 A French-Canadian woman teaches first-year courses, and the staff is comprised principally of Haitians. A six-member international  Board of Directors includes members from Germany, fr6n, the United States, Ecuador and Haiti. 

 The modern structure is a complex of buildings around a central courtyard, designed  by a Baha architect who, in return for donating his services, was given the freedom to innovate, using construction methods and materials he deemed suitable. He used this opportunity to develop the ideas he had been advocating that would lower construction costs in developing countries, while upgrading quality. 

 His design maximizes the positive aspects of the Haitian climate, and embodies features such as massive overhangs around buildings, high ceilings with pitched roof oriented to attract prevailing winds and the use of screenbiocks instead of windows, which result in a comfortable environment during Haiti's hottest temperatures. The landscaping further improves the design, with trees and planting that will contribute to comfort. 

 While operating costs are substantially provided by the same family who gave the physical plant, there is also room for contributions.  Sponsorship of individual students is invited by Baha'is from abroad. Tuition is set at three dollars per month, but matriculation

  is open to all, while actual costs run about fifteen dollars per student per month. The attempt is to fulfill the wish of the Guardian with respect to Baha'i educational institutions: 'Let them, freely and without charge, open the doors of their schools and their higher institutions for the study of sciences and the liberal arts, to non-Bah6.'i children and youth who are poor and in need.'

 Two academic institutions mark Brazil's entrance into the formal school experience. Escola das Na~6es, a school in Brazilia, the nation's capital, accommodates one hundred and fifty students from thirty-eight countries. Most are the children of diplomats. 

 Almost all the teachers are Baha'is. The school is expanding, seeking land and financial support. 

 The Nova Era School is for preschool and kindergarten children, ages two to six. It opened in 1980 with forty pupils and by December 1982, had ninety-five. Though not announcing their sources, because of religious intolerance, the teachers give the children prayers and selections from the Writings. Brazilian Baha'is also operate three tutorial schools in other areas. 

  Including those already mentioned above, forty-one national communities have been assigned the development of tutorial schools as a goal of the Seven Year Plan. The following are some others who have had notable results.

 community, by the spring of 1983, had eight tutorial schools in operation among the tribal peoples of the islands of Mindoro, Mindanao and Palawan. Most were begun during the Five Year Plan. Of special interest are the schools on eastern Mindoro among a tribal group known collectively  as Mangyan, whose language is a subject of many academic studies. 

 They read and write in a 48-character syllabary of Indic derivation. Despite westernization of much of the Philippines and a resultant loss of culture, beliefs, originality and language, the Mang-yans  have kept their distinctive script and may be the only such tribe using these characters. The area was opened to the Faith in the 1960s and '70s by traveling teachers. 

 In 1977 the first Assembly was established among the Hanu-1100  people, a subgroup of the hinterland whose culture has been the topic of scholarly dissertations. 

 The tutorial school is located at Tapi-Nabiran about thirtyfive kilometers from the town of Mansalay. 

 The students number about twenty boys and girls who att6nd regular classes six days a week, for six hours a day. They also celebrate the Nineteen Day 

Feast and Baha'i Holy      
Days. The Local Spiritual  

 Assembly provides the teachers' needs for shelter and food from their own crops. 

 The Hanunoo children proved to be very quick learners. Their curriculum has three aspects: academic, vocational and spiritual. 

 In 1980 a school was opened in Perpetual Help. Iriga City, on the island of Luzon for sixty-eight children of the Agta tribes, as the National Assembly increased its commitment to tutorial schools under the Seven Year Plan. A three-room schoolhouse and a cottage for the teachers were built with the help of several Local Assemblies in the area which also give support to the school and its dedicated Baha teachers. 

 From time to time, when there is a harvest, they bring gifts of food to the school. In addition to the daily elementary school curriculum there are adult education classes and deepening sessions for youth and older believers. 

The National Spiritual     

 Assembly has reported that children from the school have no difficulty in being accepted at public school when old enough to travel greater distances, and in fact, that they are usually placed in a more advanced grade level than anyone would have anticipated.

 which were considerable and varied. The school was undertaken by the Baha'i women (who had little previous experience) at the request of an official of the local government. 

 The venture began with seven preschool  children aged three to five and quickly became a group of twenty-one children with two teachers. The little school, which meets at the Baha'i Center, is running successfully and is seeking official recognition by the Department of Education. 

 Their kindergarten methods are based on the ANISA model developed by Baha'is in North America.

 The village of Vaama has begun tutorial education which seems to hold potential for developing into a permanent school, given the responsiveness of the community and its readiness to undertake the education of its children. The National Assembly calls it 'an example of what can happen when a village embraces wholeheartedly the lifegiving Message of Baha'u'llah.' Vaama is located in the Pujehun District. In 1983, only three months after having been constituted an Assembly, they had already built a Baha'i Center, hosted a very successful Women's Conference and organized a tutorial school for their children. Inspired by Baha'u'llah's emphasis on education,  they set aside land for raising cash crops to earn money for support of a school. The land for the Baha'i Center where the school is conducted was donated by a member of the community and is built at the back of his home. The local Baha'is did all the work and supplied all the materials except for two bags of cement which were provided by the 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 To support the school, some Baha men went hunting monkeys to sell in Liberia. They raised money for a blackboard, a teacher's desk and chairs and tables for the children. 

 The village works the teacher's farm so that he is free to teach during the day. The Local Assembly consults the National Spiritual Assembly about subjects  to be taught.

 In the U.S.A. the Louis Gregory Institute at Hemingway, South Carolina, offers educational  and tutorial enrichment for children and youth who are the products of a deficient rural educational system. A plan is in being which will reach out to the general population of the area in substantial and creative ways. It will meet needs for basic skills and at the same time increase the motivation and self-confidence  of the student (child through adult). 

 Future courses are being designed in computer use, language arts, mathematics and arts and crafts. The Institute, named for the American Hand of the Cause of God, was dedicated and opened in 1972. It came in response to the need for Baha'i education in an area of dense Baha'i population. It is the same area which will witness the birth of the first Baha'i radio station of North America in 1984. 

 The educational impact of such a BahA'f-owned and operated station will also be very great. 

 The Director of the Institute has said: 'Our aim is universal education.'

Baha'i population. Its    

 main purpose is to train the teachers for one hundred tutorial schools to be established in the country, many of them in the Departments of Chuquisaca and Cochabamba. 

In 1984 the Yachay Wasi   

 will be housed in its own splendid facility at Alto Delicias, Sucre. 

 The center will provide teacher training and other educational services principally  for the Quechna and Aymara-speaking Baha of Bolivia. Ten tutorial centers will be opened in early 1984.

 On the island of Tanna, where rapid growth of the Faith has taken place since 1981, a peripatetic teaching project has operated intermittently. 

 Since the late 1970s pioneers have served as itinerant teachers, going from village to village for short stays, offering classes in basic education for both children and adults. 
                           
  III. RELATED GOALS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS

  Baha'i efforts in education were given a boost by the natural working out of the Seven Year Plan goals to 'ensure Baha education of children' through teacher training and curriculum  development. 

 In the Americas the most significant contribution to a new educational Tutorial preschool, Bulembu, 

Swaziland;                 
          1982.                      

 model may well stem from efforts to see to the Baha'i education of children. 

 Teacher-training  events have been held in twenty countries of the Americas, with one hundred and ninety-two such gatherings already carried  out by Ridvan of 1983. 

 One outcome of teacher-training efforts for Baha education of children has been the development  of teaching abilities among members of Baha communities, the emergence of adults and youth newly-qualified to 'educate' their own and their community's children. Their work in developing curricula, their obedience in carrying out their spiritual obligation to share the Revelation with the children of the community has a 'multiplier effect' on education. 

 The children's horizons are broadened,  their cultural life enriched. 

 The use of the mind, the expansion of consciousness referred to by 'Abdu'l-Baha, feeds the insight into the realities of the universe and the hidden mysteries of Almighty God, and vice versa. And in several places, the testimony of secular teachers has shown that the learning capacity of children has increased as a direct result of their Baha'i education. 

      Colombia's Ruhi Institute  

 is a good example  of deepening-cum-education. 

 It has provided a model to several countries of the region. It is uniquely Baha'i, developed to meet the needs of rural Colombia, but with application to similar societies in many parts of the hemisphere. 

 Housed in a rural setting near Cali, Colombia, the Ruhi Institute is more a philosophy than a place. Ruhi-trained youth have visited neighboring countries of the Americas and the Caribbean, sharing their techniques by holding sessions of the Ruhi Institute. 

 The Ruhi Institute, developed by the National Spiritual Assembly under the guidance of Counsellor Farz6m ArlAb, consists of programs of deepening and consolidation. The Tutorial deepening program consists of four levels of nine courses, a total of thirty-six, covering many spiritual themes designed to help the student along a personal path of service to the Cause. 

 The deeds of service begin with simple actions and gradually grow in complexity. 

 An individual familiar with the Ruhi courses who wishes to study more deeply may choose individual tutoring, regular classes with a group in a village or neighborhood once or twice a week, weekend institutes, or

 intensive institutes of one to four weeks' duration. 

 The success of the Ruhi Institute is probably due to the basic concept, as stated in its information booklet: 'The basis of any true process of learning is the understanding of the Revelation of 

God through His Manifestation.'

 Another key to success has been the choice of 'Service to the Cause' as the axis around which courses are developed. The basic idea is that 'each Baha'i may walk a joyous path of service to the Cause which, at the same time, increases his own capacity to understand and to perform ever greater deeds of service.' The Ruhi model seems to embody the idea contained in the statement of 'Abdu'l-Baha above. 

 Opportunities to introduce Baha educational  content into school settings have multiplied.  In such widely separated locations of the planet as Malaysia, Trinidad, Norway and some states of India, Baha'is have diligently filled slots opened for them in the public school systems or created, through their timely intervention, the opportunity to provide  religious training tb Baha'i children. Programs reaching into school systems, offering  a general Baha orientation to all children or a onetime visit from a traveling teacher, have been welcomed in some locations, notably Zimbabwe, Guyana, Portugal, to name but a few. A full survey of these activities has not been made, but they are known to exist in every continent. 

 The range of Baha'i interest in education is endless. 

 Baha'is of Bolivia look forward to establishing a University at Santa Cruz with educational extension programs for rural areas; the National Assembly of Belgium participates since 1980 in a Faculty of Comparative  Religion at Antwerp, an institution of higher education, founded by the Ministry of Education and approved by Royal 

Decree; the Guaymi Cultural

 Center in Panama will become a center for many aspects of personal, vocational and community education and training in addition to its basic cultural and administrative thrust; a literacy program introduced by Ethiopian Baha'is and based on their own original publications, was supported by the government; the magnificent Louhelen School facility, erected at Davison, Michigan; in 1982, will develop into a year-round residential school; Peru's 'New Era Cultural Association', acting on behalf of that National Spiritual Assembly, will collaborate with the Peruvian Ministry of Education in literacy and post-literacy activities centering in Radio Baha of Lake Titicaca; Baha'is of Imbabura Province, Ecuador, introduced the concept of 'mural newspapers' as a tool of community education among the nonliterate population. Numerous plans for future projects and interim  reports on ideas only recently conceived, indicate a swelling interest among Baha'is in every aspect of education. 
                           
        CONCLUSION                 

  The various educational efforts that have sprung up' or have been painstakingly raised, burgeoning or struggling for existence, have in common the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Whatever the experimental forms through which Baha'i education must pass, whatever adaptations emerge from earlier academic theories or practices, the Baha'i school will always be, it is hoped, grounded in the Revelation, and be the fruit of the didactic principles of the Divine Educator. The 'true education' spoken of by Baha'u'llah may be the heritage from this era of development. A new model may arise from the merger of what has heretofore been thought of as academic or secular education with the spiritual content of the Revelation itself — the enabling factor in producing the True Education of this and future epochs.

  7. BAHA'I YOUTH ACADEMY OF INDIA

THE Baha'i Youth Academy  

 was established  on 27 June 1982 in Pancligani, India. Its aim is to become a permanent institution for Baha'i scholarship as well as to provide a national centre for the deepening and training of Baha'is from all parts of India who, armed with newfound knowledge and skills, may then return to their home States and set up similar programmes and training institutes for the local believers in their own languages. 

 Although the Academy plans eventually to hold study courses of from six months' to two years' duration, at its present stage of development  and with its limited facilities it conducts courses of from one to seven weeks. Each course is tailored to the need of a specific group of believers such as State Teaching Committee members, State and Local Youth Committee members, assistants to Auxiliary Board members, pioneers, Baha'i women, editors of State newsletters and graduates  of the 

New Era and Rabbani Schools. The

 first year of the Academy's experience indicated that this system of holding courses for specific groups instead of holding general deepening programmes open to all is more effective as it enables the instructors to concentrate  on the specific needs of the particular group and to adjust the lessons to the level of understanding of the students. 

 Since its inception the Academy has held three successful courses, each with a different  emphasis. 

 The first course, of six weeks' duration, was a general one for youth and drew thirty-six participants. 

 It was held simultaneously with a similar course in Persian for ninety-nine Persian pioneers from India and abroad. 

 The second course was lengthened to seven weeks to include a weeklong 'spiritualization' element, and was designed specifically for the members of State 

Teaching Committees.      

 The course focused on the functions and administration of these valuable teaching arms of the National Spiritual 

Assembly.                 

 The third course, three weeks long, was for Baha'i women and included special classes on the role and station of Baha'i women in the community and the family as well as a class on famous women in Baha history. 

 By March 1983, one hundred and sixty-two students from sixteen States in India, the An-daman  Islands, and the neighbouring countries of Pakistan, 

Bangladesh and Sri Lanka  

 had completed courses at the Academy. Each of the courses, though having its own unique character and emphasis, follows the same basic outline: six classes per day, each class one hour in length, for six days each week. Each class has its own daily assignments and most of them require the students to sit for a final examination at the end of the course. 

 The core subjects covered in every Academy course are: Baha'i administration; laws and ordinances; Baha'i history; the Covenant; protection of the Faith and meeting  opposition; Baha'i education and 

Baha principles. Additional

 classes to date have included: teaching the Faith; a study of selected chapters from 'Abdu'l-Baha's Some Answered Questions; progressive revelation and the history of religions; the station of women in the Baha'i dispensation and a study of some famous Baha'i women; the role of women in Baha'i administration; organizing Baha activities; family life and a study of the spiritual implications of Baha'u'llah's 

The Seven Valleys. In     

 addition, an extracurricular course in black-and-white photography and darkroom techniques has been a regular and popular feature of each course. 

 Students find that the courses are both rigorous and thrilling.  Most teachers use the methods of discussion and question-and-answer, thus involving  the students actively in the learning process rather than requiring them to listen passively to a lecture. 

 Secondary to their studies, but also an essential part of each student's experience at the Academy, is the fellowship and contact he enjoys with his fellow believers, not only those who come from different parts of India and neighbouring countries but with the Baha friends of Pancligani who are themselves  from all parts of the world. 

 In Panch-gani  the students may enjoy Baha films and slide programmes and learn Baha songs in both 

English and Hindi. They   

 may visit the New Era School and the Institute of Rural Technology. No less valuable for the students

  and ultimately for the entire Baha'i community is the interaction with their Baha'i brothers and sisters from different States, who are of different races and religious backgrounds and who speak different languages. In a country as varied and diverse as India, the experience of Baha'i community life at the Academy is in itself the most powerful demonstration, to those within the Baha'i community and those without, of the unifying power of 

Baha'u'llah's Revelation.   

 A third component of the Academy programme  is vocational training designed to equip students with a practical skill that will be useful and will enable them to be self supporting either at home or in pioneering posts abroad. 

 Although necessarily limited in scope at present, it is visualized that this element will expand to include training in auto mechanics, electrical wiring, tailoring, cycle repair, radio and television repair and other skills. 

 Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, is Baha'u'llah's exhortation, that ye may unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths. Within the first day or two of a course students at the Academy find themselves fully immersed in a study of the vast ocean of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Within the first week they catch glimmerings of the immensity, majesty and transforming power of the Holy Writings, while their teachers observe in them a more fully awakened sense of belonging to a Cause that is mightier than they had realized previously. 

 Usually, about half way through a course, the students begin to feel 'drowned' in a sea of assignments, wondering whether it is really necessary to cover so much material in so short a time; but by the last week most of them request that the Academy extend the course for at least another week, having come to realize that despite their arduous labours they have merely skimmed the surface of the vast and limitless ocean of Baha'u'llah's Words. And when their examinations are over the students' normal sense of relief is tempered by a desire to know more, to delve even more deeply. It will be apparent that such an intensive study experience has the potential to transform the Baha communities of India and surrounding countries where there are many Baha'is with the desire and capacity to study deeply the


<p232>
232                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Holy Writings but who are hindered in their efforts through lack of opportunity, lack of access to Baha books or the need of assistance to study in English, there being only a limited number of works as yet translated into languages indigenous to India and these being of varying quality. 

 Teachers at the Academy are drawn from the highly qualified cadre of professional educators in the Pancligani Baha'i community, including the Principal and counsellor and staff members of the 

New Era School. Assistance 

 is also given by Baha from other parts of India who are distinguished for their knowledge of the Faith and their ability to teach. This group of visiting teachers has included members of the Continental Board of 

Counsellors Auxiliary      

 Board members and members of national committees in India, and will in future include outstanding Baha'i teachers from abroad. 

 In the Spring of 1982 the National Baha'i Youth Committee of India, in consultation with Counsellor 

Burh6ni'd-Din Afshfn       

 conceived  the idea of establishing the Academy. Its rapid growth and progress during its first year inspired the National Spiritual Assembly to designate it an independent institution to function directly under the aegis of the National Assembly. 
From the beginning the Continental

Board of Counsellors       

 gave the nascent institution its wholehearted support, contributing both guidance and funds. 

 When planning was begun for the first course, the Academy had only one full-time staff member, the Director. An Assistant-Director was needed and was promptly engaged. After completion of the second course the staff grew to five. 

 In addition to the general organizing of the different courses and the correspondence and report-writing that is involved, the Academy has four separate departments with their own duties. 

The Department of Library  

 and Correspondence  Courses organizes the Academy Library (which is already, perhaps, the largest Baha library in India), prepares and distri butes to Academy students and pioneers deepening materials in both Persian and English, supervises the English correspondence course, stores and files all materials used in Academy courses and operates a book-selling service in Panchgani. The AudioVisual Department is in charge of showing films and slide programmes  during Academy courses, makes cassette tapes of deepening material and music with Baha'i themes, prepares photographs and other materials for sale and has in hand plans for preparing films and video tapes on different Baha'i subjects for use both in the villages and in the Academy classroom. 
In addition there is a     

Department of Finance      
and a Department of Organization.

 Each department  is managed by one person with various assistants as necessary. 

 Before the completion of its first year the Academy will hold three more courses: a five-week course for students at the New Era School to help prepare them for their pioneering  services to all parts of the world; a course for graduating students at the Rabbani Baha'i School; and a course for youth, especially those who are members of State and Local Youth Committees. 

 There has long been a crying need for such an institution in India, a vast country whose population has demonstrated great receptivity to the Baha'i teachings. Through the ever-present  and keenly felt confirmations of the Ancient Beauty, Baha'u'llah; through the encouragement and prayers of the Universal House of Justice and the International Teaching  Centre; through the vision of the National Youth Committee and the support and cooperation  of the Continental Board of Counsellors  and the National Spiritual Assembly, the Academy has triumphed over the difficulties of birth to emerge as a viable institution which promises to be an increasingly effective instrument for service to the Cause of God in India and beyond its borders.

  8. THE RABBANI SCHOOL AT GWALIOR, INDIA 

                  STEPHEN H. WAITE

  THE Rabbani School at Gwalior stands today as one of a growing number of Baha'i schools in India and throughout the world. 

In India, the New Era      

 School at Panchgani was established in 1945, followed by Rabbani in 1977; and now in the first part of this decade, many new schools throughout India and Sikkim are beginning. 

 They all follow in the footsteps of the famous 

Tarbiyat Baha Schools     

 in IrAn. Interestingly, many of the present Baha'i schools. Rabbani prominently among them, are more than simple academic institutions; they are a new type of model through which the transforming influence of Baha'u'llah's World Order flows; they are not only schools but centres of community development, social service projects and adult literacy and training programmes. 

 All reach out to the surrounding communities. They are among the 'agencies of this Administrative Order that have combined to bring into focus new possibilities in the evolution of the Baha world' .~ 
                           
    THE MANDATE OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

  The Rabbani School is being de~e1oped under the loving and careful guidance of the Universal House of Justice and the National Spiritual 

Assembly of India. Its     

 purpose is unique. The House of Justice, in its letter of 28 July 1974, stated that the primary purpose for establishing the Rabbani School, beyond offering needed services to many Baha'i families, is to assist the teaching and consolidation work in India through training potential village teachers'. The school's fundamental aim is thus to train a substantial number of staunch and deepened 

Baha'i teachers. Towards   

 this end, the curriculum has three major aspects: academic, vocational and Baha. In the words of the Universal House of Justice, the students, after their years at the school, will have had the opportunity to achieve competence in the required  academic subjects and will also have participated in a supervised work plan which will have provided real experience in valuable skills. 

 In addition, during this period they will have become imbued with the Baha'i life of worship and service as observed in the school, and will have become involved in direct Baha'i teaching.' 

 The development of the Rabbani School was included as one of India's goals during the Five Year Plan (1974 — 1979), and its further development is a goal of the present 

Seven Year Plan.           

  THREE ASPECTS OF THE CURRICULUM: MORAL, VOCATIONAL, ACADEMIC The most distinctive feature of education at the Rabbani School is that boys live for six years in a Baha'i environment that helps them to become members of 'a new race of men', of high moral fibre, strength of character and resourcefulness. 

 They rise each morning with Baha'i prayers, and live according to the Baha'i calendar of Holy Days, Feasts, the Fast and other festivals and observances. 

 They learn how to conduct Baha meetings and to consult properly; study Baha'i administration extensively, and experience firsthand its func tions in mock assembly meetings, on school committees, and in actual Ridvan elections. Through memorization of Baha'i texts and prayers, as well as important excerpts from other Holy Scriptures, they develop a wide range of knowledge and acquire a store of songs, literature and teaching albums to take to their villages. 

 The entire student body has been divided into teams of ten students. 

 The teams travel The Universal House of Justice, 20 October 1983.

  on selected Sundays to nearby villages to conduct children's schools and deepening classes. Members of the faculty accompany them on these trips. As the school expands into village development activities, students will become more directly involved in the dissemination of technical skills which will be of direct economic, social and health benefit to the surrounding villages. 

 This training should equip the students to function as deepened, experienced Baha'i teachers of good character with sufficient skills at their disposal to help both technically and spiritually  in the advancement of their villages. 

 The development of a fullfledged six-year Baha academic curriculum where boys study daily the Baha'i Faith, their mother religion —  Hinduism — and other great religions, as well as moral principles, has proven to be a very great challenge. Faculty members and various committees at the school have attempted to develop materials in Hindi. Much work remains to be done. 

 The vocational emphasis at the school derives from the mandate letter of 28 July 1974 from the 

Universal House of Justice

 in which it is specified that the school '. will ultimately be strongly vocational in its atmosphere  and curriculum'. This is essential since the school aims primarily to train boys to return to their villages. The vocational curriculum now includes agriculture, animal husbandry  and poultry; and will include fish farming, sanitation, village technologies and basic building trades. 

 Interested students may also be trained in smallscale industrial skills. Presently, vocational skills are taught in several  hours of practical work per week to complement the theory taught in class. 

 For example, boys take responsibility for a small plot of land where they grow and harvest crops, or for a small poultry unit where all aspects of work are under their supervision. 

 Development of a vocational programme has proven to be difficult mainly because of the high capital investments required at the beginning, although substantial amounts of the school's acreage have been brought under cultivation, a large poultry farm is in operation, a dairy has been started, and carpentry training will soon be introduced. 

 The most highly developed aspect of the programme is the academic school. 

 In 1983 Rabbani became a fully recognized Higher Secondary School, with classes six through eleven. Approximately twenty per cent of all Rabbani boys taking the State middle board examination have attained merit positions, Faculty and students of Rabbani School; 1983.

  while most of the others have done very well. The first graduating class stood successfully for the eleventh standard

in 1983.                   
                           
         SELF-HELP TOWARDS SELF-SUFFICIENCY

  Incorporating the vocations within the academic and theoretical programme is emphasized  in such a way as to make Rabbani a self-help school; that is, it will'. embody a self-help component whereby the village students will undertake a measure of the work of farm and school', as envisioned by the Universal  House of Justice. Taking such responsibility  for the physical work and contributing towards the cost of their education helps foster self-reliance in these youths. In 1983 a graduated system of fees based on the parents' ability to pay was introduced. 

 The fees vary from family to family. Baha'i funds and direct donations to the school provide scholarships. 

 The school's scholarship fund has developed steadily as Baha'is around the world have offered increasing support. Annually, twenty-five to forty per cent of the school's operating budget has been received through the scholarship  fund. 

 In addition to fees and farm income, the remaining amount needed to operate the school has come from the national and international funds of the Faith. Approximately $225 (U.S.) per year covers full fees for each boy. In 1977 parents paid only eight per cent of this. In the 1983 — 1984 school year they paid nearly thirty-eight per cent, and the boys' labour amounted to twenty-two per cent. 

 Self-help is part of a larger effort to render the school self-sufficient. 

 Economic activities at the school are presently aimed at offsetting operating costs with profit from the sales of eggs and hens and some produce from agriculture.  Plans are being considered for other activities which will not oniy support the school's operating costs but will make substantial contributions to the capitalization costs. 

 Until the 1983 — 1984 school year, however,  capitalization was made possible by the national and international funds and by contributions from individuals. 
                           
            HISTORY AND STAGES OF GROWTH

  The Rabbani School is located on the plains of north-central India just outside the city of Owalior. 

 Its seventy-two acres of farmland, a large main building and several auxiliary buildings were purchased on 20 February 1964 by the National Spiritual 

Assembly of India. The     

 property is beautiful, with large trees and many date palms that make it a virtual oasis amidst the surrounding scrub forest. The previous owner, the Maharaja Scindia of Gwalior, had used it as a lodge when hunting wild boar. The school was established near Gwalior because continuous teaching efforts, begun in that area in 1962, resulted in a large Baha population. 

Nearly 3,100 Local Spiritual

 Assemblies exist in this region of Northern Madhya Pradesh. The potential of this property to serve the development of the Faith in the heart of this area was clearly seen by the Hand of the Cause 

Dr. Rahmatu'llah Mirza    

 who encouraged its purchase and is credited with giving it the name 'Rabbani'. Presently, many of the students come from this region as well as from five other States —  Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Kamataka, Manipur and Sikkim — and from the neighbouring country of 

Nepal.                     

 During the early years, a number of institutes were held at Rabbani, as well as large conferences called in honour of visits by five Hands of the Cause. 

 Two very large conferences were held in 1964 and 1968 when the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha R6hfyyih Kh6num visited. 

The Hand of the Cause Enoch

 Olinga, and his wife, visited in 1967. In 1969 Rabbani was host to the Hands of the Cause Tar6zu'116h 

Samandari and Dr. Adel-bert 

 Mtihlschlegel who were accompanied by Mr. ilushmand Fatheazam. The Hand of the Cause Dr. Rahmatu'116h Muh6jir visited several times; his last visit was in 1978. 

 The operation of a school on the Rabbani


<p236>
236                THE BAHA I WORLD

 property has not been continuous since it first started in 1967. A boarding school was in operation from 1967 to 1970, the students numbering nearly seventy, sixteen of Whom were from Tibetan refugee families. Regular academic activities were held in standards five through nine. From 1970 to 1977, however, the school ceased to function, and boys were taken to a boarding hostel in Gwalior. They received academic training at other schools and moral training at the hostel. 

 In 1974 the hostel, with the twelve remaining students, was shifted to Indore for one year. 

 During the period from 1970 to 1974 the National Spiritual Assembly supervised a subcommittee  that studied the requirements for reestablishing the Rabbani School and clarifying  its objectives. 

 Also during this time, because of the urgent need to find a qualified Baha'i to serve as the school's Director, contact was made with two American believers,  Dr. Stephen Waite and Mrs. Sherman Waite. 

 Dr. Waite visited the school in April 1974 and decided to accept the challenge of its restoration. 

 Shortly after completing his doctoral  thesis in education at the University of Massachusetts Dr. Waite, together with his wife, arrived to stay in December 1975. The Waites were joined at that time by Mr. Ray Betts, a seventy-one-year-old pioneer from the United States and Belize who had had several years of experience in tropical agriculture.  Mr. Betts spent nearly a year at the Rabbani School improving the soil and fruit trees, introducing composting and the use of natural fertilizers and mulching. 

 With great humour he persevered through the trials of inspection by curious villagers and of being hard of hearing, which made learning a new language quite difficult. 

 Mr. Betts recently passed on to the AbhA Kingdom. 

 Before the school could reopen there were the problems of obtaining electricity, plumbing ing and adequate living space. By organizing the villagers to make agricultural proposals for electricity, and helping them to arrange for. bank loans, it was possible to obtain an electrical connection that had been sought unsuccessfully in that area for five years. In addition, a work crew came from Pancligani, site of the New Era Baha'i School, to help build a shower and toilet facility, dining hail, gobar gas plant to produce methane, and to install all the plumbing. 

 The Rabbani School was reopened in July 1977 with forty-seven boys in the sixth grade and a faculty of four. All students were housed in the main building which contained classrooms, offices and staff rooms. 

 Each year after that a new group of students was admitted in the sixth standard until, in the 1982 — 1983 academic year, one hundred and eighty-seven studentswere in attendance. 

 In 1977 a second pioneering family joined the newly-reopened school, Mr. and Mrs. Feroze and Elizabeth Dallas from the United Kingdom, and their two children. 

 Mr. Dallas served as Director of Agriculture and Mrs. Dallas served as School Nurse. 

 Mr. Dallas's knowledge of Hindi revived from his childhood  days in Bombay, coupled with his extensive training abroad, made him well qualified for the position he filled. 

 The farm was gradually established and a fishery begun. An agriculture curriculum was developed combining theoretical study with practical activities. 

 During these years faculty members joined the staff, both as teachers, and in agriculture and other capacities. In 1982 — 1983 a teaching staff of fourteen, and a support staff of over thirty, served at the school. Rabbani's teachers come from several different 

Hindi-speaking  States    

 in India. Also from 1982 to 1984 a number of Iranian friends served on the staff in various positions. 
                          
GROWTH OF THE PHYSICAL PLANT: PROJECTING RABBANI INTO THE FUTURE

  During the initial years  adoption of an architectural of the school's operation master plan which was made existing buildings were   possible by the voluntary efforts modified to meet all schoolof two dedicated Baha'i needs. Only a few major structuresarchitects, Mr. Thomas such as kitchen-dining    Kubala and Mr. Allen Washatko, and bathroom  facilities of Cedarberg, Wisconsin, were added during those   U.S.A. They designed all years. Further expansion  the required facilities was planned with the      for a school of five

  hundred students, taking advantage where possible of modern innovations in solar and wind technology. 

 The first dormitory for sixty-four  boys, the cornerstone of which was laid on 4 November 1981 by Mr. and Mrs. Hushmand Fatheazam, was completed in July of 1983. An additional dormitory will be completed in 1984. The master plan includes dormitories, classrooms, staff apartments, a Baha'i deepening institute, vocational facilities, additional animal husbandry areas, sports grounds, public service buildings (such as the community development project building currently under construction) and at the centre will be a prayer hail located on an island in the heart of the campus. 

 Recently, with the assistance of Baha'i funds and grants from the Canadian International Development Agency. (CIDA), several  community development projects have been initiated at Rabbani. They will be merged within several years. The first is the Rabbani 

Rural Health Project      

 functioning in three communities to train villagers as voluntary  health care workers. Their job is to promote immunization, sanitation, prenatal, intranatal and postnatal care, improved maternal  and child nutrition and to provide knowledge and treatment of selected illnesses, with referral of more serious cases. 

 In mid1983 a second grant was given to Rabbani by the Canadian International Development  Agency, with one-third of the funds provided by the Baha'i community and two-thirds by CIDA. Work began in December  1983 with plans for the development of twenty villages. Initially, assessments are being made in the villages to ascertain what is needed and what the people can contribute themselves. 

 In many of the adopted villages no schools exist, yet considerable interest in education has been expressed. Part of the plan, therefore, is to assist in the establishment of Baha'i primary day schools. In many cases inactive and untrained 

Local Spiritual Assemblies

 are being assisted to learn to manage these schools in cooperation with the project personnel. 

 Great emphasis is being placed on training each Local Spiritual Assembly  and community, as this will be the means for ensuring a balanced development of the village. It has been noted that villagers often find it easier to organize around practical,  daily issues, so such an undertaking will provide the substance for the Local Assembly's consultation and deepening. 
The school


<p238>
238                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  will provide a primary school education for the young children of the village, and adult literacy programmes. Baha'i deepening programmes  will be channelled through each school as a centre for community activities. The Rabbani School premises are being developed  for vocational training for both Rab-bani  students and for people from these villages. Many government programmes recognize  the value of such training and provide loans to the villagers for the development of a poultry unit or a smallscale industrial unit. Within a few years the training of community health workers will also be integrated into this larger project. 

 The ultimate aim of this community development project is to assist the adopted communities to develop spiritually, economically,  socially, educationally and in health so that they become distinctive Baha villages. These villages in turn will provide an example for other villages nearby. 

 Also, as development ment efforts are undertaken all over India, the experience gained at Rabbani will be of use to others. 

 The community development programmes  will gradually be integrated into the school programme, allowing a total shift in the emphasis of the school away from the academic to the practical. Boys will receive on-the-job training in these villages as they are called upon to teach or to help establish a programme or industry in a village. 

 Rabbani boys will also play a more involved role in the Baha'i deepening work conducted in each village. 

 Rabbani is gradually becoming much more than a school as it integrates itself into the surrounding 

Baha communities. It     

 will retain its academic programme for both students and adults, the Baha'i deepening programme for individuals, Assemblies, children and youth, and the community development programmes, including public services such as health care and adult literacy training.

                  9. TRAIL OF LIGHT
                   BARBARA BARRETT

  THE 'Trail of Light' blazed through Latin America by indigenous Baha'is from North America in the summer of 1982 gave thrilling evidence of the bond of Faith that unites the hemisphere's indigenous Baha'is. Nine Baha'is, members of seven native tribes of North America — Cree, 

Blackfoot, Metis and Ilingit

 of Canada; Upik Eskimo and Tlingit of Alaska; Navajo and Makah of the United States — traveled and taught in ten countries during June, July and August. 

 They visited Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama,  Chile, Peru, Bolivia and finally Ecuador, where their visit was planned to coincide with the opening of the International 

Baha Conference  at Quito

 on 6 — 8 August. They spoke, danced and sang before varied groups, forging Links of friendship with their Latin American brothers in the Faith, and especially with their brother-indigenous, the native tribal peoples of the south. The public acceptance of the visitors from North America surprised even the planners. Everywhere they were received with admiration, enthusiasm and fraternal spirit. 

 Many Baha'is were moved to observe that this was an important step toward realizing 'Abdu'l-Baha's vision of the destiny of the Western hemisphere's native peoples. In the Tablets of the Divine Plan He wrote: You must attach great importance to the Indians, the original inhabitants of America should these Indians be educated and properly guided, there can be no doubt that through the Divine teachings they will become  so enlightened that the whole earth will be illumined. 

  The Trail of Light began in Arizona on the Navajo Reservation where an 

International Teaching     

 Conference on the property of the future Southwest Baha'i Institute brought the team members together for the first time on 19 — 20 June. Reports mention 'a sense of history in the making' as three members of the Continental 

Board of Counsellors       

 in the Americas helped to launch the first trip of its kind. They were Mrs. Lauretta King of Alaska, 

Mr. Raill Pav6n of Colombia
and                        

Mrs. Carmen de Burafato    

 of Mexico. Mrs. de Burafato described the original migrations of native peoples of the hemisphere, saying that the travels of the Baha'is along a 'trail of light' was a dream come true. Mrs. King, who is a Tlingit from Eagle River, Alaska, was able to share her sensitive perception of Indian teaching needs. 

 A memorable session with Mr. Pav6n on the spirit and principles of teaching was translated from Spanish into English and then into Navajo. A memorial service for Mr. Amoz Gibson, recently deceased  member of the Universal House of Justice, flooded the hearts of those gathered there with memories of his early Navajo pioneering days and remindc~d them of his love for the Navajos. 

The 'Trail of Light'       

 was there dedicated to his memory. 

 Two teams set out from Arizona. One went to five coufitries of Central America and the other to Chile, Bolivia and Peru, meeting up in Quito, Ecuador, at the International Conference. 

 The southern contingent was made up of: Rita Blumenstein of Palmer, 

Alaska, a Yupik Eskimo     

 who speaks Yupik, performs native dances, makes traditional baskets and is adept at the Eskimo art of skin-sewing; Chester Kahn of Houck, Arizona, Navajo, a knowledgeable Baha teacher of rich experience  in the Faith, who performs Navajo songs and dances; (Later that summer Mr. Kahn was elected a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of the United States) Rebecca McKerinet, of 

Juneau Alaska, of Tlingit  

 Indian and Japanese ancestry, who sings Tijugit cultural songs and is one of few remaining members of a TLingit royal family. She wears a beautiful native costume; Louise Profeit, of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory,  Canada, a Tlingit who recites prayers in her native tongue. She is a registered nurse working in health education whose Baha'i experience includes Local Spiritual 

Assembly and National      
Teaching Committee membership. 

 Mrs. Profeit is from a respected Yukon family and is the mother of three children.

 supplement of 4 July devoted the entire first page to the subject. 

 Radio interviews were outstanding in all the cities.' 

 In Region IX (where eighty-nine of Chile's Local Assemblies are and 14,000 Baha'is live) there were public performances at two Baha'i schools, a presentation at the Baha'i Institute and at the Cultural Center of the City of Temuco with two hundred and fifty present, and an appearance at a municipal school in Temuco for an audience of six hundred children and faculty. 

 'Among all the activities, the most moving  was the heart-to-heart contact with our brothers the Mapuche Baha'is', stated the National Spiritual Assembly. 'The high point came at the end of the performance in Temuco when they danced the 'Eagle Dance' with a Chilean Mapuche group, 

Kalle-Kalle Mapu. They     

 made the amazing discovery that Tlingit and Mapuche have almost exactly the same Eagle Dance. The audience was ecstatic, responding to the dance with a standing ovation.

          BOLIVIA                    

  Leaving Chile on 1 July, the same group visited the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba, Sucre, Potosf and Oruro during eighteen days in Bolivia, giving public meetings in cultural centers, schools and universities. 

 Between city visits they met rural indigenous Baha'is and their neighbors. One memorable visit to the countryside is described by the group's photographer and sometime translator, Gregg Suhm (a pioneer to Ecuador and staff member of 

Radio Baha'i of Otavlo).   

 lie traveled with the team to the town of Cajas Kasa high in the Andes. He writes, 'After a seven-hour jeep ride through rough terrain the team came upon an arch of stones perched on a boulder •    An explosion of dynamite (a sign of respect paid to honored guests) startled the team, but let neighbors know that a special event was to take place.' As the team approached,  the wood flute and drum bands of three Local Spiritual Assemblies struck up lively 

Bolivian tunes. Heartfelt  

 greetings of 'A11~h-u-AbM' were exchanged as Trail members  choked back tears of joy at the warmth of their reception. After a lunch served inside the modest local Haziratu'1-Quds built of adobe brick, they made their presentation outside against a backdrop of barren hills and a deep Mue sky. Afterwards, the Quechua believers, wearing multicolored woven caps, played, their long flutes called samponas. All joined in dancing around the circle of musicians. Sturdy children sang lustily their songs of love for Baha'u'llah and the joy of being Baha'is. 

 It ended too soon. Hands reached out in farewell. Another stick of dynamite was set off as a 'goodbye', and the jeep moved away while the team sang 'All6h-u-Abhd' with the encounter etched in their memories. 

 A typical 'city' day for the busy team would include a television interview, a proclamation in ceremonial costume at a Cultural Center, a fireside and a radio interview, as in Potosi on 9 July (preceded by early rising for dawn prayers and a seven-hour jeep ride). In La Paz, on 14 July, the President of Bolivia welcomed the team. 

 Also present were twelve Ministers of Departments from around the country, some of whom were themselves indigenous. 

 The Governor of the Department of La Paz also greeted the Trail members in his office, stating that he identified with many of the Baha'i principles. Other major events in the capital included two twenty-minute cultural programs for the state-owned television  which were later aired nationwide. 
                           
           PERU                       

  On 18 July the team was received at the border between Bolivia and Peru by members of the staff of Radio Baha'i of Puno. 

 They rested that night and on the next day went as guests of honor to a gigantic indigenous music festival hosted by the Local Spiritual 

Assembly  of Caspa. Three 

 thousand Aymara Indians from surrounding villages attended. From morning to afternoon there were performances  by the visitors in their native dress and by local groups. In Caspa the team was joined by 

Counsellor Mas'tid Khamsi  

 who spoke over the microphone to the vast crowd, emphasizing the importance of the visit by the northerners and of the fulfillment of Indian prophecy through the coming of the Trail of 

Light. Auxiliary Board     

 member Andr6s Jachacollo spoke in Aymara with strength and fervor. The crowd listened intently as each North American shared his thoughts and some aspects of his culture. 

 In the late afternoon of the same day the team performed in the stadium of the town of Juli for more than a thousand persons. The following day they were guests at the official inauguration of the Baha'i Teaching Institute building at Chucuito, adjacent to the Baha radio station. Thousands of villagers attended and many more heard the program on the air. In Puno on the 21st, the Trail group visited the College of Fine Arts and the radio and television stations. 

 In Cuzco on the 22nd, they met hundreds of campesinos and toured the magnificent ruins of Machu Pichu, capital of the ancient Inca empire. Some described the visit as a kind of 'pilgrimage' to pay homage to the once-great civilization with which they felt a kinship. The vestiges of that civilization inspired a feeling of awe for the majestic beauty and the evidences of high technology. The visitors were accompanied by Exaltaci6n Quispe and his wife. (Quisp6 is the first indigenous Baha'i of Cuzco.)

  In Lima they visited newspapers and were interviewed on a television news show wearing  their colorful costumes. From there they were flown to northern Peru to visit the jungle area of the Aguaruna Indians. 

 At an all-day Council given by the Naranjilla Bajo Baha'i community they met hundreds of Aguarunas and their chiefs, performing for them, feasting with them and expressing common concerns and values. From Lima the southern group left for Ecuador to join the other team at Quito where their participation was one of the highlights of the 

International Conference.  

  An outdoor performance in Pucyura, Peru. 

  The team that went to five Central American countries included: 

         Walter Austin, Ilingit     

 of Kake, Alaska, who speaks and writes the Ilingit language and is an effective public orator; 

     Rick Belcourt, Metis (a    

 mixture of Plains Indian and French ancestry), from Edmonton,  Alberta, Canada, who has a profound grasp of native culture and history, plays guitar and performs the traditional pipe ceremony; Rita Markishtum, Makah, of Washington, U.S.A., who has served the Baha'i community  in many capacities, and who performs traditional dances; Audrey McCarty, Makah, also of Washington,  also a dancer and narrator of native legends; 

    Pat Twigge, Blackfoot      

 from Blood Reserve in Alberta, Canada. (He was, unfortunately, with the group only through Mexico as a chronic back ailment became aggravated by dancing, forcing him to return home.)

  'Five beautiful souls have won the hearts of the people, both Baha'i and public,' wrote Counsellor 

Artemus Lamb. The five-member Trail

 group arrived in Mexico City on 21 June accompanied by Counsellor Lauretta King and Fletcher Bennett, Auxiliary Board member from Canada who filmed the activities. In Tampico, State of Veracruz, interviews were held with the leading newspaper, the University newspaper and television and radio stations. In Pablanta there were many meetings  with Totonaco Indians of that region and a proclamation for more than one hundred. 

 In Oaxaca City about three hundred people were drawn to a public meeting where the team demonstrated their tribal dances and songs and shared Baha'i Teachings. In the indigenous village of Lachigoloo one hundred and seventy-five persons attended a public meeting.  Both meetings were the largest of their kind ever held by Baha'is in the State of Oaxaca. 
Media publicity was extensive.

 At the Baha Center in Merida, Yucatan, an interview was filmed for television news, and an article and photograph were published in a Merida paper. In other parts of the Yucatan peninsula more than one hundred Baha'is and their friends attended each event. In Quintana Roo a proclamation in an open-air  theatre belonging to the government attracted an audience of over six hundred. The performers shared samples of their tribal songs, dances and traditions as well as the basic teachings of the Faith. The next morning brought an interview with the President of the city. 

 Counsellor Lamb wrote: 'It is impossible to estimate the spiritual impact of this historic project, but it is certainly very great, both on local Baha'is and on friends of the Faith and the public. 

 Everywhere people were amazed to learn that the Faith had penetrated the indigenous areas of North America; furthermore, they were deeply impressed by the spirituality, capacity and love of the team. Already in Mexico, new concepts, ideas and plans are being discussed on how to carry this process forward, both on a national and an international level.'

          BELIZE                    

  On 9 July the team left for Belize, reduced to four members. They talked and performed for public meetings in Corozal, 

Orange Walk and Belize    

 City, attracting large crowds in the Last two places. Their dances and songs and some talks on the Faith were videotaped for Belize television. 

 They recorded two radio shows for the regular Baha'i program of Belize. A newspaper story on 9 July was headlined, 

'First Time in Belize!    
American Indians Visit.'  

 It called the 'Trail of Light' an exciting, energetic, colorful group of Baha'i Indians and named their tribes, inviting the public to hear them talk about their religion at the Town Hall. 
                          
         HONDURAS                  

  Torrential rains made travel almost impossible during the threeday stay of the team in Honduras, 13 — 15 April. Nevertheless, a visit was made to Yoro where the Indian chiefs were begging for them to come. 

 Four hundred native people, including several tribal chiefs, heard the Message. 
On a washed-out road between

Tegucigalpa and Viaseto   

 the river was so swollen that the team had to cross on logs. At the top of a hill, after a long walk in the intense heat, the team met with one hundred people in a log cabin. The chief of the village told a traditional tale of their ancestors who had said that one day friends from the north would come looking for them. 'Now you are here,' he said, 'now you have found us and our hearts are bound together.' In spite of widespread hunger in the village of Viaseto, the people shared their food with great love and generosity. It was here that Rita Markishtum of the Makah tribe of Neah Bay, Washington, speaking on the oral traditions of her people, said: 'There is a prophecy that a man in Canada saw the beginning  of the spiritual rebirth of the Makalis. 

 He said that he saw a council fire gather, n6t only at Neah Bay, but he saw that same fire move to Alaska, down through the United States, and even into Central and South America. So, when the invitation was extended to us to go on this trip, it was more than just a teaching endeavor, rather, it was to be part of a tremendous undertaking The Paya Indians of Olancho, a smaller The Trail of Light in

  In Guatemala, two sparkling performances of dance, song and inspired talks on the Faith drew crowds which filled the National Hazi-ratu'1-Quds  to overflowing both morning and afternoon. 

 Violence in other Indian areas of the country caused the four days in mid-July to be spent in Quezaltenango and surrounding villages. 

 In Cantel a small theatre that had been rented quickly filled up. The Mayor sent word that the entire village wanted to see the program and asked that it be moved to the main square. It was, and an estimated five hundred attended. In San Juan Ostuncalco the team visited the Mayor, had supper with Baha'is in a home, then went to a large theatre which promptly filled with an enthusiastic audience of twelve hundred — a record attendance for a Baha'i event. The final number that evening was performed by a local group whose director is the husband of a Baha'i. They were nine young ladies (not Baha'is) who sang three Baha'i songs. In Quezaltenango there were two radio interviews,  a visit to the Mayor and lunch with Baha'is at the Center, followed by a meeting for three hundred at a central hail. The keen interest of the public, the authorities and the media in the Trail of Light and its performances was due, in the opinion of Counsellor

          PANAMA                     

  The travelers arrived in Panama on 21 July to start a schedule that included radio and television appearances and public programs which were given wide newspaper coverage. Visits were made to Puerto Armuelles and David and a meeting at the Magisterio Pana-meflo Unido brought a capacity audience. A Teaching Conference with 'Camino del Sol', as the Trail of Light was called in Spanish, was held in the gardens of the 

Baha'i House of Worship    

 on the first of August, just before the team left for Ecuador. Probably the most significant event of the Central American tour was the first Native Baha'i Council of the region.

       From 29 July to 9 August   

 the Trail of Light teams converged in Ecuador to the delight of their more than fourteen hundred Baha'i brothers and sisters from forty-three countries, including representatives of twenty-four National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 and of more than twenty Indian tribes. When the two teams joined on 4 August in Quito for their first reunion since the Arizona Conference, high excitement and a sense of jubilation prevailed as they shared joys and difficulties experienced along the 'Trail of Light'. 

 The Hand of the Cause Paul Haney paid them tribute, as did the Counsellors of the Americas who had been instrumental in the creation, organization and carrying out of the entire project. 

 Highlights of the teams' contributions in Ecuador outside the Conference setting were: an appearance at a university in the coastal city of Guayaquil; a newspaper interview and a television performance in the same city; a visit to Otavalo, home of Radio Baha'i; and a television appearance in the capital, publicizing the International Conference. 

 The moving performances they had given in scores of places during June, July and August were repeated for an audience of two thousand at 'Noche Folkl6rico', a nighttime event to which the public were invited. 

 The climax of the Quito Conference came as the Trail of Light, accompanied by Counsellors Lauretta King and Ra6l Pav6n, made a moving presentation in which they called onto the stage Baha'is of twenty-seven Indian tribes. 

 A final leg of the trip took team members to Canada to attend the third North 

American Baha'i Native     

 Council held on the Blood Reserve in southwestern Alberta on 12 — 15 August. There they shared moving accounts of the Latin American tour with four hundred and sixty Baha and friends — members of sixty Indian tribes. 

 And on 3 — 5 September, in their last appearance, the Trail of Light was introduced to approximately ten thousand Baha'is attending the International Baha'i Conference in Montreal. They were warmly praised for their historic trek which had done so much to justify the Master's confidence in the high destiny of the native Americans.

246                THE BAHA'I WORLD

        10. THE CENTENARY OF THE FOUNDING OF
             THE BAHA'I FAITH IN INDIA

 1880 — 1980 INDIA holds a unique place of honour in Baha'i history in that from the earliest days of the era inaugurated by the BTh there were Indians who searched out and accepted the teachings of the New Day. Shaykh Sa'id-i-Hindi,  an Indian, was among the Letters of the Living. An Indian dervish travelled to Chihrfq in response to a dream in which the BTh appeared to him, accepted his Lord and was given the name by Him 'Qahru'116h' (the Wrath of God). Others from India attained the presence of Baha'u'llah and of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

    It was Baha'u'llah Himself 

 who instructed Jamal Effendi, a Persian scholar of noble birth and high rank, to proceed to India and acquaint its people with the Baha'i teachings. Jamal Effendi arrived in Bombay in 1872 and proceeded to travel throughout the country. Despite the language difficulty he managed to convey the Baha'i teachings to many distinguished people. Jamal Effendi's vast knowledge, eloquent tongue and unfailing courtesy attracted many persons to him, and he was the guest of a number of prominent Indians of high standing. At innumerable meetings and discussions Jamal 

Effendi outlined  Baha'u'llah's

 teachings for the upliftment of mankind and many recognized the truth of his words and embraced the Baha'i Cause. 

 It was not until 1880 that Jamal Effendi's strenuous efforts produced permanent results. In that year the first Baha'i group was formed at Bombay and from there the Faith spread rapidly to Poona, Calcutta, Karachi and 

Delhi where Local Spiritual

 Assemblies were eventually established. 

    In 1923 the National Spiritual

 Assembly of India and Burma was formed. With the formation of a national administrative body, several teaching plans were instituted with the result that the number of adherents, local centres and Local 

Spiritual Assemblies      
multiplied  steadily.    

 Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), once part of the jurisdiction of the National Spiritual Assembly, formed their own National Assemblies in 1957, 1959 and 1962 respectively. 

 The celebrations of the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Baha'i Faith in the subcontinent were inaugurated on 2 

May 1980 at Baha'i House  

 in New Delhi with a reception attepded by approximately four hundred guests. Many dignitaries were present including  the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 

 An attractive exhibition of Baha'i publications was mounted for the occasion. 

 The event was fully reported on radio, television and in the newspapers. 

 Contour, a popular publication of the Hindustan Times carried in its issue of 24 May 1980 not oniy a two-page article on the origins, aims and purposes of the Baha Faith but full-page photographs of 'Abdu'l-Baha and of the model of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

  The National Spiritual    

 Assembly received numerous messages of congratulation in relation  to the centenary observance. In her message the Prime Minister stated: 'The Baha'i Faith seeks to bring people together to enable them to realize their unity and their own inner potentialities for growth. It commands wide respect in our own land which believes in rendering equal homage to all religions and creeds.' 

 The President wrote: 'India has always stood for universal brotherhood and the message of Baha'is is in keeping with the past spiritual tradition of India. The need of the hour is to bring about this universal outlook and thereby to create a new world order based on peace, progress and prosperity.' 

 Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao, the Minister for External Affairs, in his opening address at the centenary gathering said that Baha'u'llah inaugurated  the age of planetary society, the coming of age of the entire human race when there began to dawn in human consciousness  the need to build a global society based on interdependence and justice. At this centenary celebration, he added, we might well pause and consider how much more immediate and pressing Baha'u'llah's teachings  have become since they were first promul

  gated. He concluded his address by wishing the Baha of India the fulfilment of their highest hopes in serving the noble Baha'i ideals. 

     The former Chief Justice   

 of India, M. H. Beg, acted as chairman of the function. 

 He concluded his learned and inspiring address by saying that he rejoiced at the bold challenge of the call of Baha'u'llah for people of all religions to disregard labels and unite in the service of mankind. 

 Dr. H. M. Munje and Dr. S. Vasudevan, the Baha'i speakers, delivered their addresses in Hindi and English respectively. 

 Minutes after the conclusion of the festivities Delhi television included an item about the celebration  in their telecast, and national networks  carried the news throughout the country. Thus the opening notes of the centenary celebration were sounded in the capital and were later echoed in similar gatherings throughout  all States of India. The National Spiritual Assembly reported that between May and October 1980 forty-four Local 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 had held centenary observances which had achieved wide publicity through the press and radio. Important dignitaries of each community participated in the programmes. 'One of the important aspects of these functions', the National Assembly stated, 'is that they were arranged through local resources.' The 

Local Spiritual Assembly   

 of Bombay produced a special commemorative brochure to mark its centenary celebration. 

 the first National Convention of the Baha of India more than a half-century ago were the extending of an invitation to the beloved Master to visit India and the desire to have a Mashriqu'1-A~!j~k~r built in that country. 

 The Baha'is attending the National Convention of 1980 not only celebrated the centenary of the founding of the Faith in India but thrilled to the announcement that a contract had been awarded for the construction at Bahapur of a House of Worship for the Indian subcontinent.

    11. THE PERSECUTION OF THE BAHA'I COMMUNITY
                       OF IRAN
               Ridvan 1979 — Ridvan 1983
                    GEOFFREY NASH

  DURING the period 1979 to 1983 the revolutionary r6gime in Ir6n perpetrated the first full-scale persecution of fran's Baha community since 1955 — 1956. In fact, this latest pogrom developed into the most severe onslaught in this century against the Baha Faith, its members, endowments, holy places and institutions. By April 1983 well over one hundred Baha'is had been martyred or kidnapped.  The wave of persecutions threatened to intensify overnight, swelling the number of deaths from hundreds to thousands. 

 The desecration of the House of the Bab (1979), and the confiscation of holy places, administrative and social facilities owned by the community, not to speak of the loss of cemeteries, has left the Baha'i community of I din outwardly deprived of five generations external development. The anguish experienced  can, in human terms, barely be estimated. 

 It can perhaps only be observed that throughout their ordeal, the Baha'is of I r~tn, under the self-sacrificing generalship of two martyred 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 and their heroic successors, and as many Auxiliary Board members, have retained a consciousness  of their heritage in the arena of persecu-lion  that befittingly has raised them, in the eyes of the Baha'i community outside the Cradle of the Faith, to rank alongside the Dawn-Breakers  of the Heroic Age. This consciousness,  so poignantly felt by any reader of the day-to-day unfolding of the persecution, in which individuals and institutions successively rose up, only to fall to the assassin's bullet, calls to mind the incident at Brtrfurhsh chronicled by Nabfl, in which one by one the followers of the Nb arose to proclaim the new adhdn ('call to prayer'), and were each shot down, in spite of which the call was completed. 

 This became the motto of the first National 

Spiritual Assembly.        

 To appreciate the providential outcome of this new persecution of the Iranian Baha'is for the growth of the Baha'i Faith as a whole, one can do no better than study the observations Shoghi Effendi made on the pogrom of 1955, observations which seem even more apposite today: this fresh ordeal that has, in pursuance of the mysterious dispensations of Providence,  afflicted the Faith, at this unexpected hour, far from dealing a fatal blow to its institutions pr existence, should be regarded as a blessing in disguise, not a "calamity" but a "providence" of 

God .                     

 'Whatever its outcome, this sudden commotion that has seized the Baha'i world, that has revived the hopes and emboldened the host of the adversaries of the Faith intent on quenching its Light and obliterating it from the face of the earth, has served as a trumpet call in the sounding of which the press of the world, the cries of its vociferous enemies, the public remonstrances of both men of good will and those in authority have joined, proclaiming  far and wide its existence, publicizing its history, defending its verities, unveiling its truths, demonstrating the character of its institutions and advertising its aims and purposes.' 

 And speaking (in the same place) of the publicity the persecution of the Iranian Baha'is then had won for the Faith, the Guardian emphasized that this'. cannot but prove to be a prelude, however slow the process involved, to the emancipation of these same valiant sufferers from the galling fetters of an antiquated religious orthodoxy, which, great as has been its decline in the course of over a century, still wields considerable power and exercises a widespread influence in high circles as well as among the masses.'1 It is in this context that we must view the outwardly tragic series of events that has befallen the Baha'i community of IrAn during the period in question.

  Translation into English of a circular letter dated March 1982 which was addressed to a Baha'i who was suspended from employment in government service. The letter threatens dismissal, and deprivation of salary and other rights, unless the recipient severs association with the Baha'i Faith. 

A. SURVEY OF EVENTS       

  The Growing Storm: the period January 1979 to 

January 1980              

 From the outset of the revolutionary upheaval that removed Shah Mohammed 

Reza Pahiavi, Baha'is     

 were subject to attack from several quarters. 

 In the summer of the previous year (1978), and again in December, the agents of the government had harassed the Baha'is in several localities in order to transfer onto them the wrath of the antigovernment crowds. 

 Baha'is were dismissed from government ment posts in an effort to bolster the government's fast-waning popularity. 

 Baha'i homes were burned by SAVAK (secret police) agents, and in the Shir~tz area a high-ranking lodal cleric turned back anti-BaM'i mobs incited by SAVAK. 

 However, once the change in regime had been effected, the non-participa-tion in the process of revolution of the Baha'i community, which is forbidden by its Faith to involve itself in politics, enabled traditionally  hostile elements to conduct a campaign against it. Faced with a chaotic proliferation of bodies


<p252>
252                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  claiming revolutionary authority, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of fr6n, in the months immediately following the revolution,  made representations to many leaders, as well as to the press, concerning the true nature of Baha'i activity and institutions in I din. This was an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread accusation that the Baha'is of fr6n had actively supported the r6gime of the Shah, and had been members of SAVAK. In particular, Baha'i representatives met with high-ranking clergy in Shfrhz Qum and Mashhad in February 1979. However, such representations, which continued in van-OHS  forms preceding the arrest and disappearance  of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of fran in August 1980, proved unavailing. Persecutions grew in volume and while the source of these has undoubtedly  been the fundamentalist clerics, their allies and supporters among the Revolutionary Guards and 'Komitehs', secular parties within frAn made little effort to stay their hands, and indeed in some cases have gone on record as attacking the Baha'is. 

 The same is true of the moderate clerics who have remained outside the 

Islamic r6-gime.  Baha'i   

 representatives in the early days more often than not reported a sympathetic hearing, yet events belied their initial optimism. 

 'While it appears that the weakness of the provisional government, set up soon after the return of Ayatollah Khomeini to fran in February, suggests that the opening stage of applied pressure on the Baha'is was not government sponsored, the extent to which Baha were harassed during this period, and, more significantly, the speed with which Baha'i properties were confiscated, points to the existence of not only anti-Bah6'f cliques, but a more widespread sympathy for the measures being taken against the Baha'i community. 

 The takeover of the two Baha'i companies, Nawnahtn (investment company) and Uman& (foundation for the maintenance and purchase of Ba1P'f community properties and holy places), proceeded in two stages: first, they were raided by Revolutionary Guards (February), their offices searched and keys impounded; then they were progressively occupied, their staffs dismissed and, by the summer, their premises taken over by 

Revolu                     

 tionary Guards; and, finally, by the end of the year, they had been officially stripped of their assets, and non-Bah6'i directors, inimical to the aims of the companies themselves, had been appointed over them. However, this was not the close of the matter — Baha'is formerly associated with the administration of these companies were, in several instances, later on subjected by the new directors to crude demands for 'compensation'. 

 Although there was strong suspicion that this prompt action taken against the Baha'is, involving~ the occupation of all their holy properties, including the Houses of the Bab in Shir~z and of Baha'u'llah in Tihr~n and TAkur, was in many areas the work of forces spearheaded by Tablighat-i-Lslami,1 the crude violence directed by mobs against the properties and businesses of Baha'is enabled the authorities to represent the overall situation as the fruit of revolutionary chaos. 

 Indeed, the confusion of this period, in which Baha'is were by no means the only ones to suffer (the other religious minorities were also subject to harassment), gives credence to the view that local 'Komitehs' were simply going ahead and settling scores of their own. Thus before, during and after the transfer of power Baha'is all across the country were the objects of campaigns of violence in which homes were attacked, businesses and shops burned, livestock destroyed, and individuals harassed and assaulted. 

 Baha'i cemeteries, in particular, were attacked, desecrated and in some cases set on fire. In February, forcible recantations were staged, often at the local mosque, notably in Sarvistgn and in the area of Shfr4z. 

 However, as the year wore on, and the Baha'i properties, occupied initially, it was said, for their own 'protection', remained in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, this stance of the government, and patticularly that of the clergy-controlled 

Revolutionary Council      

 headed by Ayatollah Behesliti — the effective source of policy in the first year of the Islamic Republic — became increasingly unbelievable. 

 To begin with, all efforts by Baha'is and their sympathizers to gain for the community a declared status as a protected minority under the new Islamic constitution, 

1 See Section B, 'Identity 

 of the Persecutors, and Charges Levelled against the Baha'is', p. 267.

  went by the hoard. Under these circumstances the publicly announced abstention of the Baha'i community from the April referendum for the Islamic Republic was a courageous stand that could be expected to win the Baha'is few friends. Also courageous was the visit to Qum of a delegation of Sangsar Baha'is who requested and obtained an audience  with Ayatollah Khomeini on the question of compensation for their Baha'i Centre (Hazfratu'1-Quds), destroyed by local mobs. The Ayatollah ordered local Komitelis to desist from harassing Baha'is, but this did not prevent the occupation of the House of the B~b at the end of the month. In fact, there was an evident deterioration in the situation for the Baha, virtually month by month. In March, Mr. 

Yiisif SubMni, a prominent Baki'i

 of Tihr6n, was arrested, as was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly, albeit temporarily. The director of the Naw-naha1~n  Company was in hiding. The Baha'i Centre of Mashhad was occupied on the orders of senior Ayatollahs Shirazi and Qumi, later to be critics of the human fights record of the Islamic Government. 

In the Hamad~n, Shfr6z    

 and Tabriz areas Baha were called upon to recant their faith. By the summer the situation was worsening. 

 The Buyr-Ahmad tribe, driven from their villages by threatening mobs in the earlier part of the year, was living in refugee camps in the vicinity of Kat6, IsfaMn. After further harassment there, some six hundred of them set out for IsfaMn itself, where they arrived in early May. These Baha'is, for the most part of peasant stock, belied the propaganda of the authorities that the Baha'i Faith was made up of SAVAK employees and Zionist agents. Under considerable  intimidation to renounce their religion they remained firm, and were rendered assistan&e by their more affluent co-believers of I~fah6n before they were finally enabled to return to their homes. Meanwhile, Baha homes in Adhirb6yjan were attacked, and the Local Spiritual Assembly members in Fhrs and Hamad4n provinces were required to conceal themselves. 

 Two Baha'i girls, along with a Zoroastrian, were forced to recant and were married to Muslims. The act was announced  over the radio in Yazd. Forcible conversions were being announced regularly in the press, thus giving the lie to official statements that no one was persecuted for his or her religion in Pm. 

 In the face of this mounting pressure, the Silt of the House of the 13db. In September 1979 the building was seized and demolished by the Islamic authorities; in 1981 the site was made into a road and public square.

254                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Towns and cities in Irdn in which Baha'i holy places, cemeteries and other properties have been seized or destroyed. 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the Baha'is of fr6n conducted a campaign designed to inform as many people as possible of the real nature of Baha'i practice and belief. 

 Articles were prepared and sent to newspapers, and pamphlets  were distributed, sometimes on the streets by 

Baha'i youth. Representations

 to the authorities at the highest level continued. Baha'is abroad made discreet approaches to Iranian consulates and embassies but did not criticize or slander the Iranian government nor even create the impression that they were conducting a campaign of opposition outside frgn. 

 Yet the outcome of all this was renewed pressure, and in an atmosphere of increasingly orchestrated anti-Zionist feeling, Ayatollah Khomeini himself gave the go-ahead for the uprooting of Zionist sympathizers — a code name for the Baha'is who, due at least in part to the activities of the anti-BahA'f organizations, were identified falsely as Zionist spies simply because the Baha'i World Centre is located in Israel. 

 The anti-Bah6'f groups were almost certainly responsible for the kidnapping of wellknown Baha'is, including 

Mr. Shaykh MuI?ammad Muvahhid

 in TihrAn on 24 May, and Dr. 'Alfmur6d Ddviidi, a member of the National Spiritual Assembly, ~ 11 November,  also in Tihrdn. They must also have provided leadership for the take-pver of the Mith6qfyyih Baha'i Hospital in Tihr~n, and later on the attached Home for the Aged, when Baha old people were made homeless. Although not at this point willing to approach the international media to publicize their position, the Baha'is learned that the Reuters' correspondent in the capital had already been under pressure not to report the Baha'is' predicament. 

 However, the focal point of the overall persecution — the attack upon and desecration of the House of the Bab — finally broke the news embargo. 

 This event occurred in September  (1979) and sources suggest it was at first planned and carried out by a group acting with a considerable amount of local independence in ShfiAz. Yet, as had proved to be the case before, the central authorities in the capital stepped in oniy briefly as a token of order, but eventually concurred completely in a nefarious scheme to obliterate all traces of the holiest Baha structure in IrAn. For the

  House of the Bab, assaulted and substantially demolished between the 8th and 10th of September, received a guard appointed by the authorities in Qum, who also promised a committee of enquiry. Nevertheless, two months later the work of destruction was resumed, and the building almost razed to the ground. It was discovered that plans existed for the construction of a square in the vicinity of the mosque adjoining the House of the BTh that would require building on the site of the House. 

 There was no question but that the plans, which were iterated several times later, were intended to accomplish the removal without trace of this holy Baha'i Shrine. The international publicity given this event by the media certainly embarrassed the authorities in Tihdrn when the story first broke in September. 

 But neither this nor the cables dispatched to Ayatollah Khomeini in 

Qum and Ayatollah Beheshti 

 in Tihr~n, from Baha'is all over the world, resulted in any action being taken to restore the holy place to its rightful owners. 

 There could be no doubt that the symbolism of this sanctified place for Shfih antagonism towards the Baha'i religion in fran, guaranteed  that its desecration must further intensify an already precariously balanced struggle between, on the one hand, an increasingly ascendant fundamentalist Shfih r6gime, sworn to exalt Jsltim and to put down those it considered its enemies, and a peaceful, nonpolitical,  religious community which, whilst possessing neither the intention nor the sanction  to combat violence with violence, would never acquiesce in its own spiritual extinction. 

 Contemporaneous with this, the order for arrest of Baha'is went out from revolutionary committees in Shahsav6r, 'Ab6dAn and Tabriz Those detained included Local Spiritual 

Assembly  members. In     

 addition, homes in Tabriz were raided and literature seized. In late October Baha'is in the ministries of education, health and social administration were dismissed  from their jobs. In Shahsav4r, in November, the chief of police admitted to the existence of a circular prohibiting Baha'i meetings, and that same month arrests were stepped up in Tabrfz, KirmAn and KAsIPn. In B6shihr Baha'is were dismissed from their jobs, and in Ab&d&n a father was denied a birth certificate for his infant son on the grounds that he was a Baha'i. 

In September               

 Mr. Baha VujdAni was executed in Mah6bAd, and in December Mr. 'Azamatu'lffih 

Fahan-dizh  in TihrAn;     

 moreover, early in the year, at least three other Baha had been killed. 

 For all of these people, the fact that they were Baha'is had been the significant factor which brought about their deaths. 

 With the fundamentalist clerics and their allies tightening their hold on the country, reliable information was received which indicated  that persecution of the Iranian Baha'i community was intensifying 'gradually, quietly, but surely'. In the first month of 1980 another prominent Baha'i, Mr. Riihf Rawshan( was taken away to unknown whereabouts, whilst the Baha'i headquarters in Tihr~n, already seized, was made the headquarters of the 'Reconstruction Foundation' set up by order of Ayatollah Khomeini, who conveyed from Qum to the Baha'is the need to be 'patient' and wait for the election of the first President of the 

Islamic Republic. National 

 Spiritual Assembly members met Ayatollah Behesliti and Dr. ilabibi, spokesman for the Revolutionary Council. No indication was received from these prominent officials which could have prepared the Baha community of Iran for what was to come yet: the full brunt of a cruel persecution, a campaign of exter-Inflation. 

  The Storm Unloosed: the period February 1980 to 

February 1981              

  Against the foreground of a bitter debate, both internationally and within Ir6n, over the detention of hostages from the personnel of the American Embassy in TihrAn, the persecution  of the Iranian Baha'i community in IrAn entered a second, more dangerous stage in February 1980. Perhaps the thinking behind this development took into consideration the outside world's and the internal Iranian preoccupation  with the American hostages. It seems more than likely, however, that the anti-Bah6'i groups and their sympathizers within the Iranian government believed their attack on the Baha'i community could be conducted  smoothly, and with little opposition. The attitude of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of fran, up to now, and indeed until January 1981, continued to be one of restraint when it came to apprising the world of what was happening to their Baha'i breth


<p256>
256                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ren. It feared, no doubt with justification, that a campaign charging the leaders of fran with maltreatment of the Baha would have serious repercussions upon the believers themselves. 
At the same time, the      

National Spiritual Assembly

 continued fearlessly and, as it transpired, poignantly, without regard for the safety of its members, to represent the injustice of the treatment of the Baha'i community to the Islamic authorities. 

 The new stage of repression was launched with abductions and also raids on the homes of several National Spiritual Assembly members and a Counsellor, resulting in the imprisonment  of Mr. Baha'u'llah Farid, a member of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly of TihrAn; Mr. Yadu'llAh

 Pflstchi head of the Baha secretariat  in Tihrdn; and later, after a National Spiritual Assembly meeting at which he had been present, the arrest of Counsellor Masfh Farhangf. 

The two National Spiritual 
Assembly  members, Mr.    

Yiisif Qadfmf and Dr. 1-lusayn

 Najf, escaped arrest because they were not at home when the guards called for them. 

 Mrs. Naji was taken, however, and held with the intention of forcing Dr. Naji to give himself up. The abduction of these Baha'is raised the issue of who exactly was conducting such arrests. 

 In the case of Dr. Naji it was ascertained that no official warrant for his arrest had been issued. 

 The matter acquired a nightmare significance later in the year when all nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly were abducted and their kidnapping never thereafter officially admitted nor their fate revealed. 

 During this period the anxiety of the National Assembly for the deteriorating plight of the Baha'i community was compounded by the refusal of any of the authorities to recognize  that a threat of persecution actually existed. 

 This front continued even while the arrest of wellknown Baha and members of the administrative bodies was gathering momentum. 

In April eight Baha'is     

 were arrested in Tabriz; all but three were later released because they signed a pledge promising not to take part in the future in Baha'i administrative activities. 

 The three who refused were members  of the Local Spiritual Assembly; two were subsequently put on trial and executed (14 July). 

These were Mr. Yadu'11Th   
Astdni and Dr. Far6marz    

 Samandari. In May four Baha'is of Tihrdn went on trial charged with sundry offences, but great play was made of their having had contact with Israel either as visitors or financial contributors to the Baha endowments there. Their execution undoubtedly  rested on the fact that they were Baha'is, although the 'Zionist' complexion of their activities was the reason adduced for their deaths. In the areas outside the towns and cities, persecution was even more rough and ready: an old Baha'i shepherd in Andnin, near Birj and, was found clubbed and stoned to death. 

 In June, at a time of deepening political crisis in the country, violence, both random and officially promoted, was directed against the 

Baha of Yazd. Known      

 historically for its fanatical treatment of the Baha'is, notably in 1903 when over one hundred were murdered in its vicinity by mobs raised by elements among the local clergy, Yazd was the scene of arrests, harassment, burning of property, and exclusion from their workplaces of the Baha. To begin with, four members of the 

Local Spiritual Assembly   

 were arrested. Then, in his Friday sermon, Ayatollah Sad-duqi  demanded that the Baha'is be driven from their posts in government offices and brought before the authorities. His incendiary remarks were sufficient to send the mob on the rampage against Baha'i homes and properties,  and resulted in one hundred being prevented from working. Moreover, the cleric's remarks were printed in a TihrAn newspaper, thus giving them a national airing. As fears for the safety of the Baha'is grew, the incident was publicized abroad in an article in the Paris newspaper, Le Monde. Low-key lobbying of human rights groups and journalists in the international forums, which had been progressing  since the spring, was stepped up. 

 But even now the Baha'is remained exceptionally wary of being directly associated with any campaign  against the Iranian authorities. 

 Finally, at the end of the month, there came the news of the execution in TihrAn of Mr. Yasif Subluini. 

 Now fears arose for the fate of Baha'i prisoners in Tabriz Yazd Shir&z and Tihrhn. Although the National Assembly used all the means at its disposal, including direct appeals to the government and approaches to the International Red Cross, the two Baha'is tried

  in Tabriz — Mr. Ast~nf and Dr. Samandari —  were summarily executed, and preparations went ahead for the trial of those in Yazd, against a background of further anti-Bah&i incitement by Ayatollah Sadduqi, this time broadcast over television and radio. 

 Also, in Tihr~n, Ayatollah Au Khomeini issued dark threats against the Baha'is, albeit without expressly naming them. 

 At such a time of mounting tension — during which more Baha were arrested in Yazd and in the area of Shahab4d, and assets belonging to some of the Baha'is in Hamad~n were frozen — the National Assembly confirmed its plans for a new membership of the National Spiritual Assembly to step into the breach 'if and when the present members are arrested'. Neither the growing notice being taken in the world press of the plight of IrAn's Baha'is, nor the passing of a resolution on their behalf in the Canadian Parliament, had any effect on the deteriorating situation in tr~n. In August, there appeared false and provocative accusations in the Iranian media concerning the partidipation of Baha'is in the July coup attempt by officers in the armed forces. A commander of a corps of Revolutionary Guards in Tihr~in launched the story first, on television, and it was repeated during the month several times in the press. 

 Worse fears were raised by the confirmation as 

Prime Minister of Mohammed 

 Au Raja'i, a longstanding enemy of the Baha'i Faith, who had been instrumental, as Minister of Education in 1979, in instigating the dismissal of Baha'is from their posts as teachers and educational administrators. 

 Moreover, August had also witnessed the arrest of two British Anglican missionaries, and mounting pressure against the Christian community in general. It should be remembered that Ayatollah Khomeini himself, in his lectures on Islamic Government (1973),1 had linked the Christian missions in fran with the Baha'is as corrupters of Muslim youth. One version of the coup charge against the Baha'is — given by the 

Pars                       

  1 'In our own city of Tebran now there are centers of evil propaganda run by the churches, the Zionists, and the Bahais in order to lead our people astray and make them abandon the ordinances and teachings of Islam.' 

Ayatol-Iah  Khomeini, 'Islamic
Government', in Islam      

 and Revolution, writings and declarations of Imam Khomeini, translated and annotated by Hamid Algar, Berkeley, California, 1981, p. 128. 

 News Agency — associated the Baha'is with a recently departed missionary who, it was said, was collaborating with the American government in a plot to overthrow the Iranian government. 

 No conclusion was possible but that unified action was being planned against the Baha'is by the highest circles in fr6n when, on 21 August, the National Spiritual Assembly was interrupted in session and its members taken away to an unknown destination. Two Auxiliary Board members who were present at the meeting were also taken away. 

 In the first months that followed this grave setback for the Baha'is of fr6n, strong circumstantial evidence suggested that the eleven prisoners had been taken to the Evin prison in 

TihrAn. The Attorney General

 of I ifin initially confirmed orally that he had signed an order for their arrest, but soon afterwards he, along with other top figures in the regime, denied all knowledge of the affair. 

 Another theory is that the Baha'is had been arrested by a terrorist or guerrilla group outside the government  that wished to embarrass it. Unless firm evidence arises, any judgement as to the fate of these brave people would only be conjecture. 

 Suffice it to say that after the discovery in late December 1981 of the bodies of five who took their place on the National Spiritual Assembly, the Universal House of Justice wrote in a cable to National Spiritual Assemblies  of the Baha'i world: THIS HEINOUS 

ACT CAUSES US FEAR THAT

1980 AS WELL AS TWO OTHERS 
WHOSE WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN  
OVER TWO YEARS HAVE SUFFERED SAME
FATE.                      

  Thus, we have to conclude, passed from this world the first National Spiritual Assembly of Baha'is in the history of the Baha'i Faith to suffer the ultimate penalty of death for belief. The members' names are: 

Mr. 'Abdu'1-Husayn Taslfmi

  Together with these were the first two Auxiliary Board members to suffer the same fate: 

Dr. Yiisif 'Abb6siy~n      
Dr. uishmatu'llah Rawh~tni 

 As if the disappearance of their generals were not enough to dismay the Baha'is of fran, seven members of the community in Yazd were executed on 8 September, after a trial that was partly televised. Among the condemned was an old man in his eighties. The names of the Baha'is and their photographs  were prominently displayed in the press, as was the announcement of the Revolutionary Court that the Baha'is had been executed to compensate for the lives of Muslims who had yielded theirs in the revolutionary struggle. The first large-scale, judicial elimination of Baha'is, the execution of seven in Yazd, was accompanied by a fanfare of publicity. But nevertheless, when the Baha'i answer to the charges laid against them was faded out of the television broadcast, this caused some unrest in the town. Later on, when world public opinion, and a sizeable section of Iranian society, had become aroused by these despicable, insidious liquidations of innocent people, the authorities gave up announcing them. 

 They even dispensed with the routine of informing relatives of the executions and giving them the opportunity to redeem and bury the bodies of their loved ones. 

 Later, the bodies of martyred Baha'is would be consigned to cemeteries marked for 'infidels'. 

 In mid-September more resolutions were passed on behalf of the Baha'is, in the European Parliament at Strasbourg, and at the United Nations at Geneva, where the Subcommission on the Protection of Minorities carried a motion unopposed. As before, no material change resulted from this activity on the diplomatic front, although it seems the Iranian government, now locked in a battle between its radical clergy and secular 'moderates', was embarrassed by it. Trials of Baha'is in Tihr4n and llamad~n were prepared. 

 Mr. HAshim Farniish an Auxiliary Board member and member of the emergency committee, was arrested in Karaj. Mr. Buzurg 'Alaviydn, a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihrgn and businessman, was subjected to a lengthy interrogation concerning the Baha World 

Centre in Israel. At       

 this time, and throughout the present persecution, the nature of the Baha'i institutions in the Holy Land has been wantonly distorted by the enemies of the Baha Faith to fit into their picture of the Baha as imperialist agents and Zionist spies. Yet the pressure placed upon Baha'is before and after their 'trials' invariably turned on their being given their freedom in return for a signed statement disclaiming their belief, or, alternatively, their suffering the confiscation of all their goods and, frequently, forfeit of their lives, in the case of refusal. Demands for ransoms were definitely illegal (though too often officially sanctioned) but they were usually only a temporary means of securing freedom from persecution. Only open and public recantation could achieve this, and the handful who did so were rewarded, feted by mull6s, and had their names printed in the newspapers. 

 Such activity was doubtless designed  to undermine the will of the Baha'is overall. 

 Throughout the winter, 1980 — 1981, dismissal  of Baha'is from their employment continued.  Thousands of Baha'is from all over I din were now in need, and the National Assembly was busy with their succour. 

 Outside Iran an international Persian Relief Fund was established  by the Universal 

House of Justice. Further  

 efforts were being extended to get a commission of international lawyers into Iran to examine the position of the Baha'i community.  However, as the year came to an end, pressure against the Baha'is was increased, as Ayatollah Rahnema accused the leadership of the Baha'is of corruption, and called for their trial. 

 In his newspaper article, he said the mass of Baha'is had been misled and should be shown kindness and the way back to IslAm. Though Baha'i prisoners in Yazd were released,  scores more remained in prison in other cities and towns, and in January the news of the assassination of Professor Man6-chihr Hakim in his Tihr~n clinic cast a shadow over the entire Baha'i community. This murder was most likely accomplished by the Fedayeen-i-Islami, but the confiscation of Professor I-Iakfm's property, and the deaf ear turned to all demands by his wife for restitution from the Komiteh responsible,


<p260>

  implied the tacit approval of the authorities. Raids and arrests were conducted against the Baha'is of KirmThslPh in February, and as diplomatic activity on behalf of the Baha'is continued outside fran, the National Assembly  concluded in a memorandum that 'all doors in kin are being closed', and gave its agreement to 'large-scale international activities and publicity'. There was no guarantee  that such procedure might not heap fresh hardship on the Baha'is, but the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 clearly felt there was no alternative, 

Entering the 'Dark Centre':

 the peribd March 1981 to January 1982 A senior figure in the Iranian government, who later lost his post as the clerical party established itself as the one governing party, is known to have given a foreign diplomat his view concerning the r6gime's persecution of the Baha'is, and the effect international diplomatic  pressure on their behalf might have. He is reported as having said: 'World public opinion and moral pressure have no impact on the mullas, in fact, such pressures often cause them to become more adamant and obstinate.' 

 To this obduracy should be added, in any attempt to understand the motivation of the persecutors, their fanatical zeal in eliminating any and all whom they consider as their political opponents. Moreover, the persecution  of the Baha, in spite of its essentially religious basis, was not without political overtones, as was evidenced by the fact that many of the executions of Baha'is were carried out at times of acute political struggle in the country. It could be said that at the beginning one of the reasons for executing Baha was the thinking that such actions would win popularity. Later, when this no longer seemed to be the ca~se, the Baha'is were eliminated under the cover of periods of emergency. Nor should it be forgotten that the 'political cumes' said to have been committed by the Baha'is could always be linked with greater political issues of the time, such as the 'Zionist conspiracy' which was particularly important in the first year after the Revolution, and the actual coup attempt of July 1980, which could be discredited by linking it with the Christian missionaries and the Baha. In both instan ces there can be seen the akeady established Iranian practice of using the Baha as scapegoats. 

 (This is also applicable to the case of Amir Abbas Hoveyda, and other important political figures in the ShAh's r6girne, wrongly but continually accused of being Baha.) And, as noted earlier, though the persecutors of the Baha'is are now clearly identified as the historical enemies of the Baha'i Faith, the fundamentalist clerics and their allies, other political groups in frhn made hardly any attempt to protect them, thus demonstrating the almost universal political as well as religious  prejudice that Was extant concerning the Baha.' Undoubtedly, a major reason for this is a general ignorance in Iran of the true character of the Baha'i Faith. 

 If, in 1980, Yazd had acquired the dubious reputation of being the worst location for persecution of Baha'is, the city of Shfr6z, in the spring of 1981, achieved eminence as inaugurating a new stage in the pogrom. 

 The measure of endorsement given from the highest quarters in Tihrdn to the execution of five Baha'is in two separate batches in the spring of 1981 unmasked the fact, so long concealed, that an official campaign against the Baha community of fain was in operation. 
The executions of Mr.      

Mihdi Anvari and Mr. Hid~yatu'1hh

 Dihq~ni on 17 March, and of Mr. Yadu'114h Vahdat, Mr. SattAr Khushkhti and 

Mr. Ihsdnu'lhih Mihdfz~dih 

 on 30 April, established, according to contemporary observers,  that membership in Baha'i Assemblies was of itself a criminal offence. Mr. Anvari and Mr. Dihqani were accused at their trial of being members of Baha'i Assemblies and having contact with the 

Universal House of Justice.

 They were also charged with having collaborated with 'Colonel Vahdat' — Yadu'-11Th Vahdat, who at the time of their trial Was awaiting sentence for his 'spying' activities. Mr. Vahdat had, in fact, been the chaiTman of a relief committee for the Baha suffering privation within the Sbir~z area. 

 His wife, who had grown ill, was imprisoned as well. The execution of Mr. Valiciat, and two more of his Baha'i 'collaborators', at the end of See H. M.

  April, represented nothing less than a cynical move by the authorities against the Baha'i administration. 

 Hitherto, imprisonments and executions could be dismissed by the government as just retribution for crimes committed, having nothing to do with the victims' religion. Now such a defence was laid bare, though it did not prevent its employment on subsequent occasions. 

 Besides these executions, other Baha'is were sentenced to long terms in prison by the ShirAz courts. There was now no doubt that moves against the Baha'is were being sanctioned by the central authorities in Tih-r&n.  (Attendance at the burials of the latter three was officially restricted after the funerals of Mr. Anvari and Mr. Dihq~ni had drawn thousands.) 

 As the summer of 1981 progressed IrAn~ entered a period of intense political and social turmoil, and the reverberations could not but affect the Baha'i community, vulnerable as it always has been in the land of its birth at times of national upheaval. 

 Growing political demonstrations and an effective, if limited, state of civil war between the clerics and supporters of the Islamic Republican Party, now effectively  the party of the government, on the one hand, and on the other the Mojahedin supporters of the ousted President, Bani-Sadr, created an atmosphere of near anarchy. 

In May there were Shi'ih — Sunnf

 clashes to complicate matters, and for the first time, an attack by fanatics upon the Armenian Christian  district in JsfaMn (Julf6). Also during this month the plan to construct a square — or, as some reports now suggested, a road — over the site of the House of the Mb, moved a step nearer fruition when pressure to quit their homes was exerted upon the Baha householders in the vicinity. Elsewhere in Fdrs province some seventy Baha'i families were under duress to recant or lose all their property. 

 And as the governmental split caine to a crisis in mid-June, there occurred the worst spate of executions of Baha to date. On 14 June seven died before a firing squad in Hamad~n. 

 Between nine and ten days later two rounds of executions left seven more dead in Tihran. These Baha'is of both cities had been in prison for relatively long periods: in the cases of Dr. Masih Farhangi, Mr. Baha'u'llah 

Farid and Mr. Yadu'116h   

 Piistchf the period of imprisonment had been sixteen months before they died in Tihr~n. 

 There was a strong possibility that in the end their executions were hastily carried out and were related in some way to the agitated conditions of the time. Over two thousand mourners attended the funerals of the dead Baha in the capital city — they now became known as the second 'seven martyrs of TihiTh', standing alongside the seven celebrated Bab martyrs who had died in that place so many years before. As for the 'seven martyrs of I-Iamad6n', it had been discovered from examination  of their corpses that six of these brave men had been physically tortured before  their deaths. The body of the seventh had been riddled with bullets. It is even possible that during this period the missing eleven Baha'is, including the members of the first National Spiritual Assembly, met a similar fate. 

 On 28 June a bomb exploded at the headquartes of the governing Islamic Republican  Party, killing over seventy leading members,  including the Chief Justice, Ayatollah Behesliti. 

 Next month, a government source informed a correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor that the bomb blast was the work of Israel acting through the Baha'is in Tihr6n. 

 In such a climate arrests of Baha grew, including ten in Mashliad two of whom, 

Mr. Kam6lu'd-Din Bakht4var

 and Mr. Ni'matull4h K6tibpiir-Shahidi, were executed in Mslimar on 26 July. In KalmTh, three members of the Local Spiritual Assembly were arrested and taken to D6ry6n, Isfah6n. Other Baha'is in the area were taken to DAryfin, including five who, in early September, were executed there. 

 Thirty-one villagers near I~fah4n recanted under pressure from mobs led by Hujjat Sa'6dati, an instigator of activities against the Baha'is in that area. A Baha'i medical student in Isfahdn, in the sixth and final year of her studies, was prevented from completing her course because of her religion; and also in IsfaMn seven Baha'is were arrested, and homes were raided and literature seized. 

 Finally, on 29 July, nine Baha'is were executed in Tabriz, bringing to twenty-five the number of Baha so dealt with in the two months of June and July. 

 The situation for the Baha'is had escalated in an alarming fashion — it had truly reached a point of no return. In September the National


<p262>
262                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Assembly learned through an unofficial channel of the government that after the political opposition had been eliminated, the turn of the Baha'is would come in earnest. 

 As if to underline this, in August and September Yazd was once more the scene of intense pressure. 

 This time matters centred on a list of one hundred and seventeen Baha'is —  later increased to one hundred and fifty — who were summoned to appear before the Revolutionary  Court after their bank accounts had been frozen. The deadline was extended to the end of September, and for a six-week period the fate of these Baha — or those of them still alive, for the list included names of those now dead — hung in the balance. In the interim a motion specifically referring to the sufferings of the Baha'i community of fran was raised at the United Nations in Geneva, where the SubCommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted its second resolution on behalf of the Baha — this time more directly censorious of the Iranian government than its first resolution a year before. Perhaps this diplomatic  activity bore fruit, for the ultimatum against the Baha'is of Yazd was allowed to drop soon afterwards. 

Nevertheless, five BaWi'fs 

 were executed in DAryiin, near Isfa-Mn,  on 11 September, and in Tihr4n, on 29 August, 

Mr. Habfbu'llAh 'Azizi     
of England was also shot.  

 Also in August sixty fundamentalists  arrived in the Baha'i village of M6zg~n, near K~s1Pn — they had been sent from Qum for the purpose of exerting pressure on the Baha'is to recant, but they were later called back in disgrace. 

 The Baha'is who died in DAry6n met their fate without any announcement being made of their deaths; indeed, the bodies of three of them were buried in a Muslim cemetery. 

 This set the precedent for the events surrounding the execution, in December, of the members of the second National Spiritual Assembly. Meanwhile, Mr. 'Azizi's relatives suffered harassment; five were imprisoned, including his mother, then in her eighties. 

  With the National Spiritual

 Assembly of frAn helpless to influence, events, and international  action on behalf of the Baha'is under way, persecution within I r~n grew more pervasive.  Baha'i college students and school children began to face dismissal from schools, starting, as so often before, in Yazd. In addition, the business licences of Baha'is in one area of MdzindarAn were invalidated, and in Urhmfyyih arrests of Baha'is, including old women and children, rose to thirty-eight within a short time. Harassment and attacks continued around Bfrjand. A circular letter was issued instructing Iranian embassies and consulates not to renew the passports of Baha'is and political dissidents living abroad. Even the Iranian &nigk press began to realize that the Baha'is — unique1y out of all those suffering in ir6n — were being persecuted on religious grounds alone. 

 Then in November, amidst continuing confiscation of the property of Baha'is and a fresh raid on the Baha'i national office, there were arrested six members  of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihr6n, an institution of strategic importance to the beleaguered Baha administration. At their interrogation they were beaten. Their plight foreshadowed the third major coup against the Iranian Baha'i community. 

 After the sack of the House of the Rib, and the kidnapping of the first National Spiritual Assembly the third major blow was the arrest and secret execution of eight of the nine members of the second National Spiritual Assembly.1 

 This time there could be no doubt of the government's complicity in the event. Every single member of thi protecting, governing body of the Baha'is of I r~n was known by name to the authorities. Some had courager ously had contact, directly and indirectly, with representatives of the government. They had, like their predecessors on the first National Spiritual Assembly, fearlessly championed  the cause of their fellow-believers before the authorities, and they had done so in the knowledge that one day their lives must be forfeit. 

 Their deaths, contrived and accomplished  by their persecutors in an ignominious fashion — the bodies of five were by chance discovered in a graveyard marked for 'infidels' — struck at the very core of the Baha'i Faith in Ir6n. 

 And when on 4 January 1982 seven more Baha'is met their deaths, including six members  of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihr~n and the lady in whose house they had been meeting, it was apparent that the leadership of 1 The ninth member, a woman, was indisposed and could not attend the meeting. She later succeeded in escaping from Iran.

Existing on a Precipice:   

 the period February 1980 to April 1983 The pressure on the Baha'i community operated at all levels. At the end of 1981 Tihrgn's Baha'i cemetery was confiscated and a municipal garden planned for its site. Baha'is were told they must be buried alongside  'anti-revolutionaries', and, indeed, executed members of an opposition guerrilla movement had already been buried by the authorities in the Baha'i cemetery in Shfrhz. Several months after the Baha'i cemetery in TihrAn was closed two of its staff were arrested. The dismissal of Baha'is from a wide range of government and semiofficial employment  received confirmation when a circular  letter from the Ministry of Labour was published in Kayhan, 8 December 1981. 

 This set out that 'the punishment for anyone who is a member of the misguided Baha'i group, which Muslims unanimously consider to be outside of Islam and whose bylaws are based on the denial of God's religion, is dismissal for life from government service'. 

 In February 1982 the National

 Spiritual Assembly reported that the Baha'i community was under increasing stress in respect of its members' financial needs. At a time when unemployment in fran as a whole was rising to critical proportions and swelling the unrest, the Baha community was under an added handicap. Formerly able to serve the country through the skilled and educated personnel in its ranks, the Baha'i community now laboufed under official opprobrium. Many of its professional people had either left the country, or been imprisoned or executed, and almost all had lost their employment. 

 Newspapers  recorded daily the names of people who it was claimed were 13ah4'fs but who it was said now denied their faith in order to retain right to their pensions.1 In Fdrs province the Health Department addressed a document to the Department of Economics and Finance cancelling the pensions and salaries of retired and regular employees because of their membership in the 'misguided  sect' — thirty-six names of Baha'is were listed. 

 Not only in Mrs province was such activity occurring. 

 When it is remembered how, earlier, Baha'i army officers were denied their pensions, and letters of dismissal were sent to individual Baha'is on account of their religion from other national institutions, such as the National Oil Company and the Ministry of Education, and when it is recalled that Baha doctors had been discharged and applications  from Baha'i students rejected, in both cases on grounds of their religion, it becomes clear that a policy against the Baha'is had been adopted by all the official authorities. So thorough and heartless was this policy that in one instance a widow, who was dismissed from her work for being a I3ahd'f, was forbidden a share of her dead husband's salary, as decreed in regulations, in spite of the fact sh~ had two young dependent children; worse, she was even denied custody of her children. 

 Further confirmation that a campaign against the Baha'is was being waged by the highest authorities was avaflabk in the pronounce1 1 For the most part, such names could not be identified by the Baha'is as members of the community.

  ments of government figures in the media. In January 1982 Ayatollah Musavi-Ardibili, the Chief Justice of the Islamic Republic, referred to the Baha'is as 'infidels' in an article appearing in Kayhan. In the same piece, the Prosecutor of the Revolutionary 

Courts, Ayatollah  Muhammadi

 Gilani, made the point that according to the Qur'an the punishment for infidels was death. However, outside lr~n the case of the authorities was faring badly. In March the United Nations Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution criticizing the Iranian government's persecution of the Baha within its borders. Finally, at the Third Committee of the General Assembly at the United Nations headquarters in November, fr6n tdok the offensive by circulating to representatives a document entitled: 'Human Rights in the Islamic 

Republic of Iran — A Review  

 of the Facts.' The report did no more, however, than repeat the accusations levelled against the Baha'is from the outset of the Islamic Republic. The stance of the government  remained, incredibly, that in spite of all that had been said and done within fran since 1979, no one had suffered in that country on account of his religion. 

 Yet it had been no uncommon thing to read in the newspapers in fr6n — as for example in Kayhan, 1 

December 1981 — that Mr.     

 soandso had recanted his faith as a Baha'i in the presence of the Revolutionary Prosecutor (in the above reported  case, Ayatollah 

Muhammadi Gilani). On      

 occasion, the newspaper might even report  that an executed prisoner refused to recant his religion. 
 Thus the ordeal of the     

Baha'is continued. While   

 the war between fr6n and 'Iraq proceeded  alongside the Iranian government's war with its internal political enemies, and tens of thousands were dying in both contests, it remained true that the Baha'is were 'the only Iranians victimized exclusively for religious reasons' •~ By March 1982 over one hundred Baha'is had been killed or executed, and as many were in prison. 

 Students would have had to produce certificates of conversion in order to gain admittance into state schools, and there had been talk of ration coupons being denied to those who were not members of one of the four officially recognized re1  Sepehr Zabih, Iran Since the Revolution, London, 1982, p. 229. 

 ligions. That this threat did not materialize has been attributed by some unbiased observers to the international voice raised against the r6gime's treatment of the Baha. 

 'The outcry by the international media as well as by human rights organizations, including the New York-based 

Freedom House, Amn6sty International

 and the prestigious Committee for the Free World, however, appeared to have persuaded the Iranian r6gime to move back from the brink of a "final solution" to the Baha'i problem.2 

 During the late winter and early spring of 1982 the detached observer could be forgiven for seeing a religious community cowed into silence and displaying signs of confusion. Hundreds were fleeing over the borders, whilst many others, within the country, were effectively on the run or in hiding. 

 The authorities were now arresting the entire membership of Local Spiritual Assemblies —  as in April, when they detained eight members  of the 

Qazvfn Baha'i Assembly.    

 (In July four of these were executed, and another three, under pressure, recanted.) 

 In Shfr6z, Tihr~n, Yazd and elsewhere the number of Baha'is being arrested grew almost daily. Some were released — e.g. four in Tihran — as part of the amnesty announced by Ayatollah Khomeini in late February. Then, just as quickly, others would take their places. 

 ShirAz now became the chief area of danger. 

In March seventeen Baha'i   

 homes in the city were confiscated and thirtyfive bank accounts of Baha'is were frozen. Meanwhile, executions  proceeded apace: two in February, one in Tihriin and another in Bgbulsar. In these cases the families were not notified, and the victims were buried in non-Bahd'f cemeteries. In. April two Baha'is were executed, one in Uriimfyyih, the other in Maslihad. Mr. 'Azfzu'lhh Guishani, victim of the hangman in Mashliad was reported later in Kayhan as having been executed owing to his being murtad — that is, an apostate from IslAm. Mr. Guishani had written a small booklet entitled Why I am a Baha'i, and this was taken as evidence that he had endeavoured to seduce Muslims from their faith. The ominous phenomenon  of the mass-intimidation of Baha'is was not a new thing — it had occurred with the 2 ibid.

  Buyr-Ahmad tribe in a mountain area, v'ith several Baha'i villages, and with those in Yazd who were summoned before the Revolutionary  Court. 

 In April it was the turn of the Baha of Says6n, who were intimidated by the Im6m-Jum'ih of Bustan-Abad to become Muslims within one month or face grave consequences. While this pressure was averted, in September fifty Baha'is from Says6n were forced to append their thumbprints to documents they later learned purported to be proof of their having recanted. The episode was publicized in the newspapers, though not the letters of vehement denial written by these Baha'is to the same newspapers, avowing their continuing Baha'i belief. 

 In early May the government initiated renewed repression against a number of different communities and organizations, induding the Shaykhis of Kirmdn. That month six Baha'i Assembly members were arrested in Zanj~n, and two were executed in Unimiyyih. Five more executions  followed: three in Karaj (8 May), and two in Tihr~n (16 

May).                      

 The early summer passed with what the National Spiritual AssemNy of fran called an 'uneasy lull' for the Baha'is. 

 In late June, however, over thirty Baha'is who were employees  of the Bank Saderat were detained in Shir6z. These Baha'is spent over a month in prison before being released in August. 

 In mid-Jffly another Baha'i was executed in Shfrdz. 

 In August a further execution took place in Uriimiyyih. 

 (West AdhirbdyjAn, where this town is located, had been the scene of bitter fighting between the government forces and local insurgents, including Kurdish guerrillas.) 

The Baha'is of Unimiyyih   

 had been under pressure all year and four had been executed. It is worth noting that in these violent times, a new charge against the Baha'is, that of attempting to subvert the government, had been added to the charges customarily brought against them. In September, Marnichihr Vaf~t'i was murdered in Tih-ran,  and a note left on his body saying he had been killed because he was a Baha. 

 The summer — in the two years previous a partidil-larly grave period for execution of Baha'is —  passed with six executions between 

June and Late August.      

 In the six-month period between mid-October  1982 and mid-April 1983 the persecu tion of the Iranian Baha community teetered towards a crevasse. As war flared again between Kurdish forces and the government, and pressure Was placed upon the recognized religious minorities to conform to the government's  code of Islamic behaviour, and shortages  became an ever more oppressive feature of daily life in Iran, a realignment in the balance of political forces brought steadily to the fore a conservative clerical faction called the Hujjatiyyih. The signal triumph of this group was to be the purge of the Tudeb (Communist) Party in May 1983, which it inspired and saw implemented through its sympathizers in the government. The Hujja-tfyyih  had grown to eminence specifically as the anti-Bah&i society. 

 As its influence in government grew, the case of the Baha'is looked still more precarious with each passing month. In one city in particular, this faction had achieved a powerful hegemony. Following the arrest of most of the members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of KirmanshAh in October, and the scattering of those members still at large, the focus of arrests turned to Shfrdz. By early November some forty Baha'is were imprisoned in the latter city. That same month 

Mr. Habfbu'llah Awji       

 was executed in Shir6z, as was, subsequently, Dr. Dfy&u'lhh Ahr~iri, whose crime, according to Kayhan which reported his death, had been 'spying for Zionism'. Two more Baha'is were condemned to death in December — this time in Zanj An —  and more were arrested in Tihrhn, 

MfyAn-DuAb  and Urtimfyyih.

 But Shfr6z became the centre of a deepening crisis for the Baha'i community of frdn. There were reports that the still numerous Baha'i prisoners were being tortured. A d6marche made by fifteen European countries and expressing the fears of the signatories for the fate of the Iranian Baha'is was delivered to 

Tihrdn in January.         
 That month Ayatollah Khomeini

 announced measures to curb the arbitrary power of the Revolutionary Courts. 

 But this 'liberalization~ policy left the Baha'is behind. 

 Another Baha'i, Mr. Hidtiyatu'llAh SfyAvushi, was executed in ShfrAz, and it was learned in February through a newspaper report that twenty-two of the prisoners in Shfr~z were under sentence of death. Presumably all that was between them and their executions was the harsh pressure applied in such cases by the prison authorities


<p267>

  to get them to recant. 

 In another newspaper piece in February the President of the Revolutionary Court in Shir4z gave a chilling warning to the Baha'is: '. before it is too late recant Bah6'fsm'. It was 'absolutely certain that in the Islamic Republic of Iran there [was] no place whatsoever for Baha'is and Bah6'ism they [had] created a state within a state and a government and administration  different from Islam'. In March three more Baha'is were executed secretly in Shfr~z. It was not known whether these — and the one who had die.d in January — were among the original twenty-two sentenced to death. Meanwhile, as the political campaign waged at the behest of the Hujjatiyyih gained momentum  through April, the position of the anti-BahA'f society within the Iranian administration  was going from strength to strength. The scene in Shfrhz was being set for the worst sequence of judicial killing of members of the Baha Faith since the start of the campaign against them in 1979. 

  B.  IDENTITY OF THE PERSECUTORS, AND 

CHARGES LEVELLED           
         AGAINST THE BAHA'IS        
                           
The Anti-Bahd'i Groups     

 Two prominent groups have, been particularly  responsible for the harassment of the Baha'i community of IrAn. Both have their roots deep in the Pahiavi period, when their activities were either countenanced by the authorities, or ignored. Both achieved influence  and even representation in the highest circles of the government of the Islamic Republic of fran. 

   The Tablighat-i-Islami     

 group was founded during the early years of the reign of Shah Mohammed Reza, and adopted a nonpolitical stance which enabled it to function without let during the later years of the Shah's reign. 

 The founder of Tablighat-i-Islami was Shaykh Mabmud Halabi, a cleric who made a special study of the Baha'i Faith, including its organization and its tenets. Shaykh Halabi wrote books and pamphlets rejecting the teachings of the Baha'i Faith, including a hostile commentary on Baha'u'llah's Kitd b-i-Iqdn. 

 Hard-core members of Tablighat-i-Islami  took courses of an intensive nature preparing them for detailed refutation and assailing of the Baha'i teachings. Members of this organization used to frequent Baha'i meetings during the Pahiavi period, with the aim of causing disruption. They were also active at some periods disseminating anti-Bah4'i propaganda in the towns and villages of IrAn. 

 Their intent was to poison the minds of ordinary people against the Baha. 

 The Mujahedin organization, which was opposed to Tablighat-i-Lslami, published a document in their paper, Mujahid, on 9 June 1980. This came from the office of SAVAK, and allowed Tablighat-i-Islami to function as long as its activities were not the cause of provocation and disturbance'. The document was in fact a response to an invitation by Tablighat-i-Islami for SAVAK to join their organization in attacking the Baha'is in a 'systematic way'. 

 It should be noted that although the document was a proof of some complicity between SAVAK and Tablighat-i-Islami, it does not necessarily support the view that SAVAK actively cooperated with the anti-Bah6'f group. 

 There is some evidence to show that in the early months after the Islamic revolution Tablighat-i-Jslami spearheaded the seizure of Baha'i properties and holy places. Shaykh Halabi, who remained the group's ideologue, was reputed to have the ear of Ayatollah Taleqani, Ayatollah Gulpaygani — an old adversary  of the 

Baha'i Faith — and Ayatollah Khomeini

 himself. He is considered to have been largely responsible for the charge widely levelled against the Baha'is that they were agents of Zionism. 

 Another sometime member of the group was Muhammad-Au 

Raja'i, first Minister     

 of Education, then Prime Minister,  and finally President of the Islamic Republic. 

As Minister of Education   

 Raja'i had been responsible for a circular letter dismissing Baha'is from their jobs as teachers. 

 During the period 1982 — 1983 this group, now known as the Hujjatfyyih Society, began to acquire a greater political influence on the affairs of the country. 

 It was now in an even better position for carrying out its avowed programme of eliminating the Baha Faith.1 Observers saw this faction as instrumental in In 1982 a series of articles in the Tihran newspaper, Subbib Azadegan, identified the icailership, aims and methods of the Hujjatfyyih 

Society.


<p268>
268                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the fierce persecution of the Baha'i believers in Shir6z in 1982 — 1983. 

    The Fedayeen-i-JsLami     
was founded in the 1940s. 

 In the early period of ShTh Mohammed Reza's reign — particularly when the Shdh's own position was weak and that of the clergy momentarily strong (1951 — 1955) — the Fedayeen-i-Islami  was influential and active in assassinating  government officials. It has been said that this group encouraged the popular preacher Abu'1-Qasim Falsafi in his sermons against the Baha'i Faith in 1955. 

 They were also responsible for the occasional assassination of Baha'is, for example, 

Dr. Sulaym6n Berjis (Bin  

 is) who was killed in this period.1 As an active faction within the revolutionary forces, they were probably behind the kidnapping and assassination of at least a few Baha'is, including, it has been suggested, 

Professor Man6chihr Hakim 

 (12 January 1981). The Fedayeen-i-Islami, like the Hujjatiyyih Society,  had strong sympathizers in the government,  including some notorious religious judges and a former member who had become an extremely influential minister. 

 In addition to these two main groups, other factions within the revolution are known to have been anti-Bah6'i and active against the Baha'i Faith. 
One of these, called      

'The Society for Fighting 
Against Religious Transgressions' 

 (Mubarizih Ni Munkarat), is said to have had its own prison, whose inmates included Baha'is, and was responsible for looting  and sealing off Baha homes in TihrAn. 

  Accusations laid against the Baha'is The anti-Bah6'i groups were not alone in IrAn in condemning the Baha'is. 

 Prominent Shf'ih clerics of the last three decades were not reluctant to voice their anti-Bah&i sentiments. 

 One such figure was the supreme ShPih Mujtahid of the 1950s, Ayatollah Burujirdi, who sympathized with Tablighat-i-Islami, and who wrote to Shaykh Falsafi complaining of the influence of the Baha'is, and expressing 'the hope that a general purge of Baha'is from all government positions would be implemented'.2

 have seen — referred to the Baha Faith as a corrupt influence, and even the moderate and relatively liberal-minded Ayatollah Shariat-madari  issued a fatvd with an implicit anti-Bahh'f  bias.3 Whatever might have been the theological and political divisions with the Shf'ih clergy, execration of the Baha Faith was an issue upon which they could all join. 

 This universal scorn of the Baha'i Faith amongst the Shf'ih clergy amounted in effect to a deep-seated fear of  the theological premises and aims of the new religion. 

 It was this fear which animated their assaults on the Baha'i community, from the middle of the previous century up to the present. 

 The Baha'i teachings on issues like the return of the twelfth ImAm and the fulfilment of the prophecies of Shfih Jshm in the coming of the Mb, the completion of the dispensation of the Qur'Th and the consequent annulment of the authority of the clerics and learned who claimed to be its sole exponents, cut across the entire raison d'~tre of these religious leaders, and they had arisen with each generation to attempt to extirpate the power of the Baha'i Faith. These Shtih clerics used as their excuse — for they knew that open debate on the fundamental theological issues would not be advantageous to their cause — such opportunist charges as might besmear the Baha'is and bring down on them the rancour of the people. Hence they chose, in the last century, to clothe the Baha'is with the unpopular mantle of British and Russian Imperialism, and in the later twentieth, they painted the Baha'is with the fashionable opprobrium of being agents of the United States and servers of Zionism. 

 And when the occasion arose —  with the fall of the upopular r6gime of the Shah — they sought to discredit the Baha'is by associating them with the deposed monarch. 

 The crucial debate immediately after the Revolution of 1978 — 1979 centred on the part the Baha'is had played, or not played, in it. The other religious minorities could claim that they had been represented in the revolutionary coalition that overthrew the Shah. The Baha — for the obvious reason that they were forbidden by their religious teaching to involve themselves in politics — could not. However, the Baha'is noninvolvement in See M. M. J. Fischer,

 to Revolution, Cambridge, Mass., 1980, p. 174, n. 7.

  politics had never been recognized or accepted in kin, and the popular prejudice that the Shah had surrounded himself with Baha'is who had effectively run his government as well as the secret police, SAVAK, would be hard to dispel. Within a few weeks of the establishment of Premier Bazargan's provisional  government in February 1979, a supporter of the new r6gime in America, Mansur Farhang, gave voice to these very accusations in a panel programme on American  television. 

 It was upon this base — the one which maintained that the Baha'is had collaborated politically with the Shah and his secret police — that the attack against the Baha'i community in fran was initially launched. Added to these charges were the further accusations that the Baha'is had intimate links with the government of Israel, contributed to its funds and promoted its interests. 

 The Baha'is, in short, were Zionist spies. 

 Finally, two more charges were raised. As well as being spies for Israel, the Baha'is were agents of the Western powers and, in particular,  of the United States and Great Britain. All such trumped up charges were covers for decrying them as 'enemies of IslAm', the real basis of Shi'ih Isl6m's fanatical hatred of the Baha'i Faith being its claim to embody a further revelation of divine truth after that of IslAm. 

   The Baha'i International   

 Community, which was active in countering such arguments and generally defending the Baha as well as bringing their plight to the attention of the world diplomatic community through the United Nations in New York and Geneva, through the media and by approaches to governments, included in its publication 'Baha'is  in fran: A Report on the Persecution of a Religious Minority' answers to accusations most commonly levelled against the Baha of fr6n. These were supplemented by the statement  it prepared in response to the Iranian government's document entitled Human Rights in the Islamic 

Republic of Iran — A Review  
of the Facts.              

 Below are some extracts from the Baha'i publications: '1. Baha'is are accused of being supporters of the late Shah, of having cooperated with and benefited from the former regime, and of being a political organization opposed to the present Iranian government. 

 'The allegation that the Baha'is supported and benefited from the former r6gime is founded upon the fact that the Baha'i community  did not denounce the Pahiavi r6gime or affiliate itself with political or other organizations opposed to the r6gime, and that a small number of Baha'is were appointed to prominent positions in the civil service of that r6gime. 

 'In accordance with the teachings of their Faith, Baha'is must show loyalty and obedience  to the government of the country in which they live, whatever its form or policies. Accordingly, they do not engage in subversive activities. 

In addition, Baha'is       

 are forbidden by the laws of their Faith from becoming involved in partisan politics or from holding any political post. These principles are fundamental  and do not change with changing governments. 

 So fundamental is the principle of not accepting any political post that, in one case under the Pahiavi regime, when a Baha'i accepted appointment as a Cabinet Minister, he was expelled from the Baha'i community. 

 '2. Baha'is are accused of collaboration with 

SAT/AK.                    

 'Denunciation of any organ of government is contrary to the Baha'i principle of loyalty and obedience to government and therefore no condemnation of SAVAK and its activities was ever made by the Iranian Baha'is, either individually or co11ective~y. Once again, the silence of the Baha'is has been used as evidence of support and approbation. 

 'It can categorically be stated that the Baha'i community of IrAn was never associated  with the operations of SAVAK. 

 Such activities and organizations are contrary to the most fundamental principles of the Baha'i Faith, whose teachings explicitly cbnclemn the methods of unscrupulous politicians, forbid any form of violence, and lay upon every adherent the responsibility for respecting the dignity of his fellowmen and for upholding individual human rights. 

 'No evidence exists of any collaboration between SAVAK and the flab A'i community or between SAVAK and any individual Baha. SAVAK officials such as Parviz Sabeti, who have been described as Baha'is, were not


<p270>
270                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Baha'is. The alleged membership of such individuals in the Baha'i Faith stems from the fact that their fathers or families had once been Baha'is. It is, however, a basic principle of the Baha religion that the gift of faith springs from the free choice of the individual and cannot be automatically and blindly inherited from an earlier generation. 

 '31 Baha'is are accused of being agents of Zionism. 

     'The Baha'i World Centre   

 was, in fact, established in the last century, long before the State of Israel came into existence, and has nothing to do with Zionism. The Founder of the Baha Faith, Baha'u'llah, was exiled to the Holy Land in compliance with the orders of two Islamic governments (Ir6n and Turkey). He remained in the Holy Land until His death in 1892. His Shrine was raised there, and the Holy Land thus became the world spiritual centre of the Baha'i Faith. 

 'Baha'i pilgrims from all parts of the world regularly travel to Israel to visit the Shrine of Baha'u'llah and other sites closely associated with their Faith. 

 Thousands of Iranian Baha'is made this pilgrimage during the time when they were pennitted by law to visit 

Israel.                    

 'In accordance with the clear requirements of the teachings of the Baha'i Faith, its world spiritual and administrative centres must always  be united in one locality. Accordingly, the world administrative centre of the Baha'i Faith has always been and must continue to be in the Holy Land. 

 It cannot be relocated for the sake of a tQmporary political expediency. 

 'Contributions sent by Baha to the Baha'i World Centre in Israel are solely and exclusively  for the upkeep of their Holy Shrines and historic sites, and for the administration of their Faith. Almost all Baha in kin have made such contributions, and this fact is often used to support charges against them of collusion with 

Israel.                    

 '42 It is alleged that the Baha'i Faith was used by the colonial powers as a tool for colonial expansion into Muslim countries. 

 •~ The first three heads are quoted from The Baha'is in Irdn; no. 3 above is no. 4 in the original. 

 2 This extract is from the answer to Human Rights in the 

Islamic Republic of Iran   

 and refers specifically to the invitation extended to Baha'u'llah by the British consul-general in Bag~d6d mentioned in Cod Passes By and cited by the Iranian report as proof of Britain's support of movements which, it says, weakened the opposition to colonialism in Muslim societies. 

 'At the time of the invitation [see belowi, news of the martyrdom of the Mb and the massacre of 20,000 of His followers, had spread to the West and bad aroused much sympathy and interest among Europeans. Baha'u'llah was exiled by the Iranian government and imprisoned in Bag~ddd, 'Iraq. His plight attracted the sympathetic attention of the British consul-general in Bagj~d~d, who offered Him the protection of British citizenship  and also offered to arrange residence for Him in India or in any other place agreeable to Him. Baha'u'llah declined these offers and chose instead to remain a prisoner in Bag!~-dad. 

 'It was not unusual at that time, nor is it unusual today, for government officials to offer aid and sanctuary to those they perceive as being the victims of oppression in other countries. This kind of intervention is commonly  recognized as being humanitarian and nonpolitical in nature. The attempt to portray  the humanitarian assistance offered to Baha'u'llah as being part of a sinister project of colonial expansion is clearly ridiculous.' 

 In the same document, other instances raised by the Iranian report — such as the services rendered by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the people of Palestine during the 

First World War, and His   

 receiving of a British Knighthood  (which are cited as further proof of the 'colonial' argument) — are given answers. Indeed, these arguments are best summed up by the Baha'i 

International Community's  

 rebuttal  of the Iranian case in the following sentence, 'All of the allegations made against the Baha'is in kin are based on deliberate misinterpretations of the aims and purposes of the Baha Faith and its teachings.' To this could be added the rider: such allegations were also made through deliberate misinterpretation of the facts. 

 One further charge, not mentioned above, is perhaps even more insidious. This is the accusation that certain Baha'is were responsible for 'promoting prostitution'; in reality, this meant the witnesses to Baha'i marriages who signed their names on the marriage certificates. 

Under the Pahiavis Baha'i  

 marriages  were not officially recognized, but were not discredited either. Under the Islamic Republic the fact that the Baha'i Faith was not recognized in the constitution meant that the


<p271>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                271

  laws and ordinances of the Baha'i Faith were neither respected nor recognized. 

 Thus Baha marriages of many years' standing were held to be invalid, and the children of such unions were considered illegitimate. Those Baha who appended their names to Baha'i marriage certificates were in danger of arrest and trial on the charge noted above. 

 The charges laid against the Baha community  in fr6n have been refuted in the international forums and turned back upon the accusers who in turn have been indicted for their denial of basic human rights to the Baliai'is. 

 The Baha'i Faith has been recognized in the eyes of the world as a bona fide, independent religion, with laws and ordinances  of its own, and as such the plight of its followers in the land of its birth, where they have been without rights and recognition since the inception of their Faith, has been roundly condemned by a substantial section of the world community. It can truly be said that the trials and indignities heaped upon the Baha'is of IrAn by their traditional persecutors have achieved the opposite ends to those for which they were intended: instead of eradicating the Baha Faith once and for all, its enemies have oniy succeeded in giving it greater prominence before the eyes of mankind. 
                           
C.  PATITERN OF PERSECUTION

  This section is made up of reports of the persecution of the Iranian Baha'is, coming mostly from eyewitnesses, participants or knowledgeable friends and acquaintances of the victims. 

  Pressure in the villages and in the countryside The Buyr-Ahmad tribe lives in the mountainous  region of central IrAn between Isfah6n and Mrs provinces. 

 The tribe consists of eleven clans, one of which, the S6ddt-Mah-nnidi, is more prosperous than the others. Most of the Baha'is in this area belong to this clan. 

 'On 12 January 1979, a few hundred non-Bahd'f people of the Sadat-Mahmiidf clan surrounded the little town of Gurhzih. This hamlet consisted of eight families, six of which were Baha'is. 

 They fired shots and threw stones at them and burned the fences around their houses. The Baha families, in the confusion of this sudden attack, escaped to the mountains. They later noticed, however, that three of their babies were left in the houses. 

 When the attackers left the next day, the Baha'is returned to their damaged property  and calmed their frightened and hungry babies. 

 The next night the same incidents took place. 

 The attackers first set fire to the motor of the mill and then started shooting. One Baha'i was injured by gunfire. 

 'On the sixth night, the attacks became more severe, the mill was completely burned down, household furnishings were looted, all houses were destroyed, cattle were stolen, and the fields were damaged and orchards uprooted. 

 Because of this the Baha'is had to take refuge in the village of Darih-shiir (which has forty Baha'i families out of forty-eight households). 

 However, in this village, the friends faced the same attacks, and the intensity of the recent events brought upon them the same fate as had befallen the Baha'is of Gur6zih. 

 After two months of resisting attacks and skirmishes by armed men, they, too, were sadly forced to leave their homes and seek refuge in the central town of Kat6. The attacks on this village were so severe that the few Muslim inhabitants also had to flee; however, their property and belongings were later returned to them, whereas the Baha'is were forced to leave the ruins of their homes, their cattle, and their fields to the looters. The neighbouring villages of Katuk, Murgh-Chin~r, Guhdan, Abgarmak, Bar~ft6b, Darili-gazi, Minj and Hast received the same treatment. A number of Baha'is received gunshot injuries. 

 'In the beginning, many of the fleeing Baha sought refuge in KatA, which consisted  of seventy-eight households where all but ten were Baha. Each Baha'i family of this village ~had the bounty of receiving and caring for a number of the refugees from other villages. As more refugees arrived in Kat~, the circle around them became increasingly constricting. 

 On five occasions, a number of Mullas came to Kat~ to ask the Baha'is to recant their faith if they wanted to save their lives and property. 

 One of the tribal leaders, Habib BaMdur, extracted a considerable sum of money from the Baha'is and promised to protect them from the attacks. 

 This, however, turned out to be a trick, and his gunmen attacked them more severely. From the 6th of

  May, Habib Bah4dur's forces, as well as others, surrounded the village. Two armed men and two regular policemen, under the supervision of a Mu11~, came to KaIA and announced that they had given the Baha'is their final warning. They said that the Baha'is now had no escape, and they therefore had to go to the Mujtahid and recant their faith if they wanted to stay alive. One of the Mulhs was heard saying to Habib Bah6dur that, in the past four months, he and a number of clergymen had made every endeavour to make the Baha'is recant their faith and become Muslims; however, they had failed. Now this privilege was turned over to him to force the Baha'is to accept IslAm. Fierce shooting broke out and continued all day from all directions. 

 The Baha'is, men and women, young and old, gathered together in one place, praying and chanting Tablets. They decided to send a delegation to the attackers to tell them that since a number of their wives and daughters were in the fields, they needed some time to bring them back to the village, and then they could decide collectively what to do. 

 Fortunately, they were given five days of grace and this period of time gave them the opportunity to consult with the Local Spiritual Assembly of IsfaMn, which advised them to come to that city as soon as possible. 

 They started on their way, a journey which was hazardous in itself, but it became even more perilous because of the heavy rains, lack of transportation, and because they had to carry with them as many of their belongings as they could manage. 

 'The first convoy of refugees from the tribal region of Buyr-A1~mad started arriving in I~fahan at 5:00 p.m. on 7 May 1979. 

 They were placed in the Haziratu'1-Quds of that city, and a special committee was assigned to care for them. In less than forty-eight hours, blankets, food, carpets, etc., were provided for them. The first three days after their arrival were the most difficult for the refugees. They had come from a very difficult and dangerous journey and had lost one of their fellow Baha'is on the way, who died after having been severely beaten. Three of the women gave birth prematurely, soon after their arrival. 

 All these unfortunate Baha'is were transferred to the campsite except for a group of women and children, as well as the old and the infirm. This group was in the Irlazfratu'1-Quds when armed men from the 

Islamic  Revolutionary    

 Court suddenly arrived, and, taking with them the members of the special committee for the Baha refugees, commanded the oppressed souls to vacate the premises in twenty-four hours and to leave the city within seventy-two hours. 

 However, the members of the "Komiteh" did not even wait for the twenty-four hours. After two hours another group of gunmen came to the UaP-ratu'1-Quds and very roughly threw out these ifinocent people, among them an old lady who was paralysed. Although the government authorities gave instructions that the refugees should not be harassed, and the Hazfratu'1-Quds  should not be occupied, the 

Revolutionary  Guards     
paid no heed.              

 'One afternoon, two weeks after the camp was established in the desert campsite of Mihy6r, a number of gunmen, uninvited, entered the grounds with a loudspeaker and said they were sent by the Revolutionary Committee. 

 They first gave a sermon and issued repeated insults about the Faith and its Central Figures and slandered the Baha'i administration. 

 The Baha'is very bravely countered their accusations. One of the armed men asked publicly, "Who is the Baha'i teacher in this camp?" A man grasped the hand of a Baha'i child of tender years, took him to the loudspeaker and said, "This is one of our Baha'i teachers." 

 The child very bravely and reverently chanted a beautiful prayer. The courage which was demonstrated by this young child when intoning the Words of God had a tremendous impact on the Revolutionary Guards. Their attitude changed immediately and one of them apologetically said they came to the camp merely to see if the Baha'is needed anything. As soon as the camp was established and shelter, food and other necessities provided, some Baha'is from Isfa-Mn started a school programme at the campsite  so that the young Baha'is, who had to leave their schools, could continue their studies. 

 Early morning prayer meetings were set up and were attended by almost all of the more than 1,200 inhabitants of the camp. Some learned Baha'is began deepening classes for children and adults, and a tent was immediately set up as a dispensary by the Baha'i doctors. 

The Baha'is of Buyr-Ahmad  
suffered


<p274>

  for almost three months, beginning from early May until the middle of July. 

 They were able to return to their villages only when the Mull6 who instigated the wave of persecutions against the Baha'is in this area was disgraced by the Revolutionary authorities for his misbehaviour on some other counts and was banished from the region.' 

 KalMih is a small town in the midst of the Turkoman desert thirty miles east of Gunbad-i-K6v6s.  It has a sizeable Sunni population and had until recently about twenty-one Baha'i families. In September 1981 a new Imhm-Jum'ih arrived and in a Friday sermon issued orders to the Shfih population to entirely boycott the Baha'is, and two days later the municipal authorities abrogated the licences to trade of all the Baha'i shopkeepers. The local Baha appealtd with no avail to the Mayor and the District Governor. 

 Several hostile incidents occurred against individual Baha'is before the coming of Mutiarram (the first ten days of the first month of the Muslim year observed by Shfihs as part of their mourning period for the Im6ms). 

 'The Baha'is are used to and expect outrageous incidents during the ten days' mourning  period in the month of Muijarram. 

 'On the third day (8 November 1981), suddenly  a group of armed militiamen invaded the Baha'i shops, driving out the customers and snatching the articles they had bought. "These are Baha'is!" they shouted. 

 "Don't you know that it is forbidden to deal with these infidels?" 

 They had hoped to gather people around and cause a riot, but those who passed by merely whispered, "Why bother these innocent people?" Instead, the militiamen  sought the aid of the ruffians of the town. About fourteen of these assembled in the central square shouting anti-Bah&i s1~gans and endeavouring to attract a crowd. 

 'Finally, a number of Muslim citizens, though they knew the consequence if they interfered, came to the aid of the Baha'i shopkeepers and chased the ruffians off. Later, officers of the Gendarmerie came and closed the Baha'is' shops so as to avoid further disturbance. In obedience to the authorities the Baha'is complied. 

     '9 November. Twelve Baha  

 students were expelled from four high schools in town. Though the majority of students and teachers deplore this unjust treatment of their fellow students and friends, they are too scared to speak out. 

 On the same day the Im6m-Jum'ih issued an order forbidding the sale of necessities  of life such as bread, meat, and kerosene to the Baha'is. 

 Anyone doing business with Baha would receive one hundred lashes. The news created fear and panic in the town. It was rumoured that the Imdm-Jum'ih had ordered the Baha'is to be brought to the mosque on Friday in order to have them recant. 

The Local Spiritual Assembly

 considered  the option of all the Baha'is leaving the town. However, that same night the Im~m-Jum'ih of Gunbad-i-K6viis, having received representatives from Qum who presumably brought him new instructions, came to KalAlih and prevailed upon the new Im~m-Jum'ih there to postpone his plan. 

 Nevertheless, no one now dared to speak in favour of the Baha'is. Four days later, in a typical incident, a Baha'i woman went to the bakery with her child. 

 All the bakers and butchers had been forbidden to serve Baha'is. A fanatic in the queue told the baker the woman was a Baha'i and he must not sell her bread. However, the man whispered to the lady to give her basket to the child and leave the shop. But again, when the baker moved to put a loaf in the child's basket, the fanatic shouted in protest. Whereupon the shopkeeper cried, "How can I refuse bread to ibis innocent child? 

 What am I to say in answer to God's reprimand in the next world!" He gave the child the bread and let him go. The adversary remained silent. In fact, the people of Kahlih determined that the Baha'is should have what they needed, even if this required taking provisions to their homes.' 

 Eventually, in early December, the situation changed for the Baha, and they were allowed to reopen their shops, the ban on the sale of food to them was gradually lifted, and the Baha'i children were enabled to go back to schooL In this instance, the local people had refused to side with the powerful local cleric and his efforts against the Baha were, in the end, frustrated. 

 The village of Baha is situated in West Adhirb6yj6n; the nearest town is Urdmfyyih. 

 'On Monday, 30 May 1981, in the village of Baha, Miss Mitrd Aqdasf [age fifteen], daughter of 

Mr. 'Atta'ullAh Aqdasi     
and a

  student of the secondary school, did not return home after her final examination. Her father went to the school and enquired about his daughter, but the headmistress was away, and he learned from the students that Mftrtt had been taken to town by the teacher, 

Ms. Safiyyih Asaduqli      

 [Asadug~hi]. The next day Mr. Aqdasi again returned to the school to enquire after his daughter. The headmistress expressed her sorrow, but did not give him the address of the teacher who had custody of Mitre. Mr. Aqdasf then filed complaints with the Education Office of Ur6miyyih, and asked that his daughter be found and returned to her family. After an investigation, the Central 

Komiteh informed Mr.       

 Aqdasi that his daughter was in the custody of the Religious Judge. Mr. Aqdasf then referred his case to the Revolutionary Court, but the Religious Judge explained that Mitr& had become a Muslim and that Mr. Aqdasi now had no rights as a father and could not see her. 

 In reply, Mr. Aqdasf said that his daughter was still oniy fifteen and had not yet chosen a religion, and she was free to choose for herself. However, he desired to see her and hear the story from her own mouth. But though he pursued the matter through the office of the Attorney-General of Urflmiyyih, Mr. Aqdasi did not succeed in seeing his daughter. The Attorney-General did request by letter that the Court allow Mr. Aqdasi to have access to her, but the Court gave a negative written reply. Some days after, in fact, the Court forcibly demanded that Mr. Aqdasi hand over Mitr~'s identity card. When under duress he reluctantly complied, he was sent an official receipt.' 

 Subsequently, after some months, Mftr~ Aqdasf was returned to her family. 
                           
Murder and Assassination   

 JbrThim Ma'navf lived in His6r, a village in KhurdsAn, where he owned his house and some land. A bachelor of about seventy years of age, he had some knowledge of medicines and treated people of the area as there was no doctor. 

     'The Baha'is of His6r      

 had suffered greatly in the past. Towards the end of 1978 loudspeakers from the local mosque began to arouse the population against them. Finally, at the beginning of February 1979, a mob of some five thousand from His~r and its environs, armed with hatchets, spades and pickaxes, and provided with petrol and paraffin, converged upon the village intent on doing mischief to the Baha'is. One Shaykh Sahmi, who had befriended the Baha'is in the past, prevented the rabble from carrying out their aim but advised the members of the Local Assembly either to accept Is1~m or to quit the village, or pay an expiatory fine. 

Some Baha                

 — the friends having been given ten days to decide — consulted with their fellow believers on the Assembly of Mashliad. 

 Tension in the village increased. A group went to the home of Mr. Ma'navi, looted his property, and carried him off. A later search revealed no trace of his body except clots of blood and a broken set of artificial teeth. 

 It was apparent that he had been beaten to death. 

 'Mr. Ma'navf had served on the Local Spiritual Assembly, and as a boy of fifteen, he had been so badly beaten on account of his religion that he had been near to death. 

 His injuries had rendered him impotent, so he never married. It was six months before the oppressive atmosphere lifted for the Baha of Hi~~r, and they were free to purchase necessities of life and move as they wished.' 

     Mfr-Asadu'llAh Mukht~ri    

 was seventy years of age at the time of his death. 

 He had moved to the village of Andnin near Bfrjand, Khur~i-sAn,  some thirtyfive years before where, as a Baha'i, he had repeatedly and patiently suffered persecution at the hands of local fanatics. 

 'At the end of the month of Adhar 1357 (between 

November and December      

 1978), towards the fall of the Pahiavi regime, about one hundred men from ihe village of Shirk went to Andariin and besieged the homes of the Baha'is. 

 They collected all their Baha'i books and documents and started torturing Asadu'116h, asking him to recant his faith. His steadfastness made the crowd even angrier. They wanted to cut his throat. 

 Someone else suggested they burn him alive. 

 Asadu'llAh said, "I have some beautiful logs in my storage bin and a container of kerosene." He then took from his pocket a box of matches, gave it to the leader of the mob and said, "Even if you burn me alive, I am still a Baha'i and will never give up my faith!" 

 'That same night they beat him severely and


<p276>
276                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  started pillaging his belongings. His wife aided them by holding a lantern close by so they could attend to their looting more easily. 

 The family was left without a single blanket or carpet that night. Asadu'llTh, accompanied by his wife and children, left for 

Birjand.                   

 'They returned to Andr6n two and a half months later, and in the month of Isfand, 1358 (between February and March 1979), Asadu'-Ilali  bought a few sheep. He could not afford to employ anyone to help him and had no other means of support except to tend his flock of sheep, which at least provided food for his family. 

 On many occasions he told his wife that one of these days it was possible he would not return home because he might be killed. 

    'On 18 May 1980, Asadu'lhh 

 took his knapsack, canteen, a few loaves of bread and other supplies, and went out to the pasture with his sheep. At dusk, the sheep returned to their fold alone. Asadu'11Th's children tried all night to find their father. 

 At dawn, five kilometres from Andar6n village and about one kilometre off the main road, his body was found soaked in blood. He had been stoned and clubbed and, according to the attending physician, he had also been choked. 

 He was found lying face down on the ground with his knapsack still on his back. 

 'At the office of the security guards, and in the presence of officers as well as the physician, a number of people, including the murderers, had come to attend the inquest. They shouted violently that they did not want Asadu'114h's body buried in Andartin. 

 They boasted that they had killed him with their own hands, and added that the Baha'is in Andardn were condemned to death and soon all would be killed. The policemen tried to quiet them, but these ruffians did not care and in front of the police and guards they started throwing stones at the Baha'is. The confessed murderers were finally subdued and taken by the police to Bfrj and, where they were charged with the murder of Asadu'lldh. 

 In their appeal to Mashhad however, they were exonerated, and in the middle of November 1980 they returned to Shirk to a hero's welcome.' 

    Mr. Mul2ammad-Husayn Ma's6mf

 and his wife, Shikkar-Nis&, had a farm in the village of Nuk, near Birjand. 

 'On 22 November 1980, at around 10:00 p.m.     on a bright moonlit evening, the man told his wife that he had to go out to fill the feeding trough for the sheep. 

 His wife urged him to hurry as the tea would become cold. She was drinking hers and had not even finished half of it when she heard the door open. Since there was a curtain in front of the door, she could not see anyone. She called out her husband's name, but there was no reply. 

 'Suddenly several masked men entered the room and Shikkar-NiA' knew they bad evil intentions since the door of the courtyard had been locked and they would have had to climb the wall to enter the premises. 

 The kerosene lamp in the room provided oniy dim light, and even if the men had not been masked, she would not have been able to recognize them. 

 'Out of fear, she dropped her half-filled glass of tea. The men, without speaking, grabbed her by the arms and hands and dragged her inside the room. She cried out her husband's name, shouting for help, and one of the men tried to choke her to keep her from screaming. 

 She begged them in a gentle, low voice not to harm her husband. 

 One man held her tightly so she could not move, and another went out and brought in some rope. 

 While she continued pleading with them not to harm her husband, they tied her securely from head to toe and paid no attention to her request. Then they took her into the corridor, placed her near the wall, and brought a heavy wooden door from the corner of the house and put it on top of her. She still did not know what their intentions were. Soon, however, when they put some dry wood on top of the door and brought a kerosene lamp and poured its contents all over the wood and onto her clothes, she was horrified to realize they planned to burn her alive!' 

 Later she related that her assailants then abandoned her. The flames reached the ropes which were made of nylon and the intense heat melted them, enabling her to free herself, even though half of her body was burnt. She found her husband's overcoat, wrapped herself in it, and ran to her neighbours for assistance. 

 'When her neighbours opened the door, they were horrified to see her with her charred hands burned to the bone, and their children started to cry. She told them everything that had happened, and asked them to go to help

  her husband. The man in the household did not have the courage to leave the house, and was thinking of what he could do. 

 After much pleading from her he went on the roof to see if he could see what was happening in the vicinity of the stable where she said her husband had gone. Although the moon was full, he said he could not detect anything untoward occurring. 

 'She could wait no longer, so she borrowed a hurricane lantern from them, carried it in her burned hands, and rushed out to look for her husband. After searching for a while, she saw a form in a ditch, ran to it, and found to her horror it was her husband. He had been burned to death. 

 'One of the eyewitnesses that night told a member of the family that when everyone was looking at the crime from a distance, one of the bystanders, who was thought to be the leader of the murderous gang, was fearfully surprised when he saw Shikkar-Nis&, who was supposed to be ashes by then, standing alive near the ditch. 

 He was afraid she might recognize him and the others and said he would go and find out what had happened. 

 He was the only one who rushed to the burning ditch, and it is thought that he hit the skull of that helpless woman, because after he went to her she lost her power of speech. 

 'The man returned to where the bystanders stood — men, women and children — and all of them returned to their homes. None came forward to help this half-burned woman and offer her refuge. 

 None went to inform her son-in-law who lived in the neighbouring village of Zfrk, only one half-mile away. In the middle of the night this wronged soul, with her burning heart and body, left the charred remains of her husband in a ditch in the bitter cold of the desert, and returned home and locked herself alone in the house.' 

 Tragically, Mrs. Ma's6mi had to wait many hours, unattended, before her son-in-law was informed of her ordeal. When he discovered her she was speechless. By the time she reached hospital she was in a coma, and she finally died six days afterwards. 

 Her assailants were not detained. 

 Mr. 'Askar Muhammadi lived in Rahim-khcini  a Kurdish village in Kirm6n province. He had moved there from Tabriz, some years ago, with his two brothers. 

 'On 2 April 1982, Mr. Muhammadi returned  from his brother's house to find a number of armed guards at his door. Having searched his home and found nothing, they enquired whether he had any armaments in the house. He answered that he was a Baha'i, and therefore forbidden on account of his religion to carry arms. When they learned he was a Baha, the guards ordered Mr. Muham-madf  downstairs and, as he turned to go, shot him in the back. 

 After throwing his body in the yard they helped themselves to spoils from his house. As they were leaving they met 'Abbas  Muhammadi, and asked for his brother's identity card which they knew he possessed. Seeing 'Askar Muhammadf's picture they were able to identify him as the man they had just shot. 'Abbas asked them what crime his brother had committed that warranted his death, and was told: "He was a Baha'i, and to kill a Baha'i is a good deed for devout Muslims." 

 Mr. Muhammadi left three Sons of whom the eldest was thirteen.' 

  Professor Marnichilir      

 Hakim the renowned gastro-enterologist and Professor of Anatomy at 

TihrAn University, FAculty 

 of Medicine, had a clinic in Tihr~n, and had served on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baki'is of fr6n. Several days before his death he received phone calls threatening his life, as well as a visit from revolutionaries demanding a list of names of Baha'i doctors, which he refused to give. 

    'On 12 January 1981, Professor

 Iclakim was working in his surgery in a wing of his residence. It was evening and he was alone, waiting for a patient who had made the last appointment of the day, but had not yet appeared. He told his receptionist she could leave, he would wait a while longer for his patient. The housekeeper was away doing the shopping. 

 The door of the surgery was unbolted. 

 'When the housekeeper returned, she at once sensed that something was amiss: contrary  to the usual practice, the door of the receptionist's room was open but the room was unoccupied. Proceeding to the surgery she found the Professor in a half sitting posture in a corner. 

 There was a bullet wound in his head. On the floor were some banknotes and his gold watch; a streak of blood to the door indicated that Professor Hakim had not

  even in his last moments departed from his customary act of courtesy of seeing his patient out. 

 'Following a police investigation, their report  concluded that the motive of the murder was not robbery or political vengeance; the only other possible motive was that of religion; it appeared that the murderers must have had a violent antipathy to the religious persuasion of the deceased. 

 'The newspapers, aware for the most part that Professor Hakim had been murdered because he was a Baha'i, were with one exception — Miz~n of Tihr~n, No. 104, which carried a brief notice — afraid to report his death. However, a magazine — fib va No. 62, 4 February 1981 — subsequently published  an article by Dr. Shukru'11Th Asadi-zAdih, noting the Professor's achievements. 

 'Shortly after this tragedy, the residence of Professor Hakim and its entire contents were confiscated by order of a Komiteh of Tihrttn. Professor Hakfm had married a Frenchwoman, and had two grownup children.' (See Les Baha'is ou victoire sur la violence, by Christine Samandari-Hakim,

The Path to Martyrdom      

 The following accounts of the arrests, imprisonments, trials and executions of individuals  and groups of Baha'is, for the most part, come from firsthand witnesses or those closely associated with them. 

 Mr. Y6sif SubhAni was one of the first Baha'is to be judicially executed for his beliefs. A wellknown businessman, he was imprisoned in March 1979, and~ died on 27 June 1980, in Tihr6n. 

 The following account is from a Baha'i who had visited Mr. Subh6ni before his death. 

 'I was sitting in such a way that I could see the courtyard of the prison through the shutters. 

 I saw Mr. Subliani, as had always been his habit, walking very erect and taking long and quick strides, and the few guardsmen who were with him had difficulty keeping pace with him. He arrived in the hail with eighteen guards and prison staff members. 

 The atmosphere  was charged with spirituality, heroism and courage. Pie embraced everyone in our group with warmth and happiness. Raising his right hand, the first thing he said, addressing both his relatives and the prison staff in a strong and unshaking voice, was "Let it be known to you and to all the friends who are not here that I am being killed because of my belief in Baha'u'llah. 

 This is the source of my honour, my ultimate wish. I also said this at my trial in the Revolutionary Court. During the court proceedings two people gave false testimony in my case and God will soon punish them for what they have done." 

 'One of the guards who had led the group told Mr. Subh~ni, "We have not yet heard anything and have not received any order [for execution]." 

 Mr. Subh6nf replied, "I am quite sure of my fate. For the past four days my heart has told me what is in store for me. I am willingly waiting for that moment. When they told me in prison that my cell had been changed, I knew what it meant, and I happily announced to my fellow prisoners that I was going to be killed; so I bade them all farewell." 

 'All of us had chairs to sit on in that big hail. Mr. Subhhnf was radiating happiness and when we saw him in this elated state we were ashamed of ourselves because before coming to see him we had been preparing ourselves to console and encourage him! In fact, his courage gave us strength and removed our fears. 

 He was constantly smiling and joking with the members of his family, and told his wife: "Never weep for me or show your grief because that will disturb my soul." He advised that after his death no family members should wear black, and since his wife had on a colourful dress, he told her to wear it to his funeral. He added, "If you knew how happy I am, you would rejoice. 

 During the past few days, it is as if I have had a direct connection with Baha'u'llah, and I am counting every second for the end of my life to come. Had it not been against the wish of God, I would have made a will calling on you to observe the occasion of my death with a big feast instead of a memorial service. If these gentlemen [pointing at the guards] would allow me, I would dance to the gallows and distribute sweets to them." The guards and staff members  were highly moved and all except one left the hail with bowed heads. Some of them were heard murmuring to each other, "It is a


<p279>

  pity that such a man, has to be killed", and others said, "Praised be this man." 

 'Among the relatives present was the son of Mr. Gh6l6m Husayn A'zami, who had been killed thirtyfive days before. Mr. Sub@nf told him, "You should be proud of your father because he had the same spirit as I have today." The boy, who had been very sad, was transformed, and the next day removed his black suit and said that Mr. Sublyini had given him assurance. He has since become even more firm in the Faith. 

 'Mr. Subh6ni asked the brother of Mr. A'zami if he still exercised and continued his track activities because "those who wish to give body and soul to Baha'u'llah should be healthy and strong like me." Then he said some kind words to one of the guards who was in command of the firing squad, and asked him to convey his greetings to Mr. Kachii'i, the chief of his prison ward. Then he jokingly told the man, "Do you see how strong my chest and muscles are? 

 Tell your men to shoot very hard because I don't think the regular bullets will cause any pain to this strong body of mine; and tell them that this chest is full of the love of Baha'u'llah, and ask if they would allow me, myself, to give the command to fire." 

 The man answered, "Whatever you say." This man, called H6j-Aq~ by Mr. Sub-Mni, was greatly ashamed and very moved for a few moments, and he left the hail, saying to one of the Baha'is, "What a man!" 

 'Our meeting with Mr. Subh~inf lasted for forty-five minutes, and in an atmosphere of enthusiasm, joy and heroism. Mr. SubhAni said that if such things did not happen, the Cause of God would not progress. 

 Then, addressing his family, he admonished them to avoid having any sense of revenge against those who had given false testimony at his trial, as he had left them to God, who would surely punish the wrongdoers. 

 'During the last minutes of our meeting with him he asked us to inform the Universal House of Justice how j oyfui he was at the time of his martyrdom, so that the Supreme Body would be happy. 

 'With great respect one of the guardsmen said that the time of the visit was over. Mr. Subh6.ni embraced his family and relatives and later embraced all of the guardsmen who were waiting, kissed them, and told them how grateful he was to them. 

 At the end he embraced and kissed I-L6j-Aq~ SMihi [com-mander  of the firing squad]. 

 'When he shook hands and embraced me at the last moment, he jokingly said, "They are going to kill me! Why are your hands so cold? See how warm mine are?" 

 'On his way out of the room and from a distance he shouted to the son and brother of A'zami, "Don't you have a message for your father and brother? 

 I'm going to see him in a few hours." 

 'He returned to his cell with the same firm steps and erect posture. All of the guards accompanying him, as well as those stationed in the area who were having their dinner, were astonished at him.' Dr. Faramarz Sa-mandari  and Mr. Yadu'11Th Ast6ni both died after three months imprisonment in Tabriz. They were accused of the standard Baha 'crimes', and their executions were conducted hastily on 14 July 1980. 

 'At 10:00 p.m. on Sunday, 13 July 1980, the five Baha prisoners in Tabriz were having their dinner when two guardsmen came in and announced that Dr. 

Samandari and Mr. As-t6ni  

 should collect their belongings and follow them. Dr. Samandari asked, "What for?", and one of the guards simply replied, "You are to be executed." Dr. Samandari protested,  saying, "I have not even been tried yet." However, the guard responded, "It's none of my business. 

 'All the prisoners in the cell protested loudly, and the other three Baha'is went forward and said they should also be executed as they all had one and the same crime they were Baha'is. The guards said, "Your turn has not yet come. 

 'The two condemned men were taken out of the cell and then hurriedly wrote their wills. At 11:00 p.m. the other prisoners heard gunshots and knew their two friends had been executed.' 
                           
Yazd — September 1980        

 On 2 September 1980 fifteen Baha'is were put on trial in Yazd, charged with misleading Muslims, belonging to the party of Zionism, and spying for the United 

States and Israel. The     
proceedings were taped.    

 The accused prepared a statement in their defence. 

 During the trial one of the Baha'is asked if the 

Baha'i

  Faith were being put on trial, and he received the answer: 'We are trying the leaders of the Baha.' 

 The prisoners were not informed of the verdict, but on 8 September seven of them were taken away and shot. Each one was tied to a post, given the option of recanting and receiving a pardon, and then shot in a hail of bullets, One of the Baha'is refused to be blindfolded. Another, an elderly farmer in his eighties, bent with age, was unable to stand erect; an examination of his body revealed that three bullets went through his abdomen rather than his chest. 

 The following is a brief account by the wife of one of the martyrs: 'On the first day of July 1980, we were awakened at about 1:15 am. by the ringing of the doorbell, My husband immediately said they had come to take him away. Twenty Revolutionary Guards under the command of a man called Kashmiri actually invaded our home without presenting a written summons [search warrant] 

 from the Attorney-General. They used our telephone several times, and took all of our Baha'i books and typewriters [English and Persian], on which letters of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Yazd had been typed. 

 However, that night they did not touch the picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha Later, the typewriters  were presented at the trial as evidence of espionage. The same night they arrested six other 

Baha'is.                   

 'We did not have any information about the prisoners for twenty-five days and they would not issue a permit for us to see them. We complained and petitioned all appropriate government and religious institutions, including  Ayatollah Sadduqi, but to no avail. We even sent cables to Ayatollah Khomeini, the President, and others, all of which also had no effect. After the twenty-five days passed, they allowed us to meet with the prisoners for just ten minutes. 

 'Two months went by and they moved the prisoners to another prison, this time keeping them in a dark underground room without any outside windows, They took the prisoners out of this dark cell once every fifteen days for ten minutes oniy, We did not have any more visits with them during this time. 

 'On 7 September 1980, they phoned us to come and meet with the prisoners, and all of the families went to see their loved ones. 

 I noticed that my husband was very pale because of the lack of sunshine, and he had difficulty opening his eyes in the light, He said they were told of being transferred to another city and a decision about them would be made that night.With this understanding, we left the prison. 

 'At 7:00 a.m, the next day, somebody phoned on behalf of the Revolutionary Komi-teh  and told us that seven Baha'is had been executed for espionage. 

 Another account concludes: 'One of the guards who took the seven Baha'is away was located and confided to a Baha friend that the prisoners had been taken to Bagh-i-Khdn which is a few kilometres  outside Yazd. The Baha'is were told they were going to be executed in a few minutes and were given a brief period to write their wills, Then each was tied to a tree. The firing was erratic and more excessive than was necessary. The guard who was telling the story said that he had been one of the security guards, and the executioners were masked so as not to be identified.' 

 The names of the seven are:

 Mr. Rid6 Ffr6zi, born into the Muslim Faith in 1904, became a Baha'i in 1927, and for years lived on in the place of his birth, the small town of Ahar AdhirMyj6n. At age seventy-six he was detained in Tabriz where his son had already been imprisoned, and to where he journeyed at the wish of the National Spiritual Assembly, knowing he would likewise be put in jail, He was arrested in the village of Ahar before being sent on to Tabrfz, There he had three trial sessions, was condemned to death without the knowledge of his family, told he was going to be transported to a prison in another town, and was eventually executed on 9 November 1980. 

 'At about 6:00 p.m. his son was called and told to bid farewell as he was being sent to

  Ardibil. His son reported that when he saw his father he was puzzled by the confidence and elation that had seized him. 

 He knew it would be the Last meeting with his father. Later, when the family went to the prison to visit Mr. Ffrdzi, they were told he had been executed and they could collect his body from "VAdf Rahmat". All of Mr. FirOzi's assets were confiscated.' 
                           
Shirdz — March--April 1981   

 The circumstances surrounding the death of five Baha'is of Shir6z at this period have been described earlier. 

 The two extracts that follow accurately convey the ambience surrounding their deaths. 

 'The martyrdom of the two Baha from Ab6dih in Shirhz, Mr. Hid6yatu'llhh 

Dihq6ni and Mr. Mihdi      

 Anvari (17 March 1981), has generally created quite a stir. Until the last moment of their lives, the Revolutionary Guards tried to make them recant their faith ii~ order to stay the execution. 

 They even staged a mock execution, firing into the air, again demanding that the prisoners recant their faith. These tactics bore no results. Mr. Anvari had expressed in his last will and testament the request that his family should distribute sweets among those who had executed  him. The family took some money to the authorities and stated that in accordance with the will of Mr. Anvari, they should take the money and buy and distribute sweets to those who had executed him. They specifically stated that they did not wish to know who the executioners were; this is why they brought money instead of the sweets.' 

 Mr. Yadu'llAh Validat, Mr. Satt6r Khush-kM  and 

Ihs~.nu'11Ah MihdizThih    

 were executed  more than a month later (30 April 1981): 'An eyewitness was present on that fateful day. He reported that when I12s~n [Mihdi-z6dihj  was brought to the scene with his two companions, he fell on his knees before the guards, saying: "I am at your disposal. As you see, I have no means of defending myself, nor do I have the intention of doing so. It is my last wish, however, to know which one of you is to fire the bullet which would cause my death." None of the guards responded to his plea. He repeated his entreaty, and then sorely wept as he redirected his plea to them. 

 Finally one of them said: "I." At this point Ihs~n knelt before the man who spoke, and kissed his feet, and cried out: "Praise be to God that in the last moments of my Life I succeeded in carrying out an injunction of the Blessed Beauty. 

 I am now ready and at your disposal. I do have, however, another request. 

 Could you not blindfold me? Could you leave me free so that with my open eyes, as you fire, I may see my end?" Mr. Vahdat immediately made a similar request, saying: "It is my wish to welcome the bullets with open eyes." These events took place on Thursday, 30 April 1981, at 7:00 p.m. in Shfrdz.' 
                           
Hamaddn — June 1981          

 The summer of 1981 witnessed a cruel spate of executions of prominent figures in the Baha'i community of IrAn. Among these stands out the torture and execution of seven members of the 

Baha'i Local Assembly      

 of Hamad6n, amongst whom were counted two medical doctors. Several of these Baha'is were detained and questioned in 1979. 

Drs. Vaf6'f and Na'fmf     

 were arrested and imprisoned before the others in February 1980. The friends were summoned to the Revolutionary Court on 9 August, were released and then summoned again on 12 August, when they were taken to the police prison. 

 After three and a half months, during which time they saw nothing of their families, the six were moved to the political prison where they joined Dr. Vafa'f. 

 Whilst they were in prison the homes of these Baha'is were confiscated, and their bank accounts frozen. 

 After their deaths their families were not allowed to return to their homes. The following extracts are from accounts written by their families and friends. 

 'On 15 July 1979, a number of armed Revolutionary Guards entered the home of Husayn Mu~Laq, searched it for several hours, then took Uusayn to the Army Headquarters. He was detained for nine days during which time he was asked many questions concerning his work as secretary of the local Baha'i Assembly. 

 Finafly, the Baha managed to secure his release on bail. In December of the same year, Husayn journeyed to Spain where his children were living. 

 During the peribd of forty-five days he was in Spain, Husayn Mu~1aq could not be prevailed upon to re

  main. He had a very strong feeling that his place was in IrAn. During the period in prison, Husayn occupied himself with art work — the calligraphy of the Greatest Name and several books of prayers. 

 His memoir, which he wrote during the last days, comprised over three hundred pages. He also started to compose poetry, though he had never done so before.' 

 'During Dr. Vaf6'i's trial, a witness testified against him in the following terms: "I know him. He was a doctor for SAVAK. 

 I was taken to him and he ordered hot water to be poured over my chest." 

 Dr. VafA'i asked the man if he would take his shirt off so that the spot that had been burned could be seen. The man explained: "It wasn't so bad as to leave a mark." 

 Thereupon Dr. Vaf6.'i laughed: "Gentlemen, he was probably given a bath and he thinks boiling water was poured over him!"' 'Dr. Na'imf was employed by the Department  of Malaria Eradication of Hamad6n, first as assistant superintendent, later as superintendent  He acted as chairman of the H~ma-d~n  Local Spiritual Assembly. He bought an apartment, one room of which he used for an office and the others for a Baha friend and his family who had been driven out of a neighbouring town. 

 After the doctor's death, when his property had been confiscated, this family was evicted from the flat.' 

  'Mr. Thr6zu'LlAh Khuzayn  

 [1917 — 1981] was the oldest member of the Baha'i group. He was a humorist; at one time, when the friends objected to his snoring, he said: "Well, if you don't like it, leave the prison!" 

    'Husayn Kh6ndil [1943 — 1981]

 was particularly  worried for his three little children during the time he was in prison. When the prisoners were taken to the general prison his children came to visit their father twice a week. 

 He told his father (Yadu'llAh) not to make efforts for his release, since in any eventuality the end was death, and he believed he was destined to be martyred for his faith. 

 During the last days he made a poster of the Greatest Name for his sister-in-law.' 

 'The saddest part of the story was, unfortunately, its ending. When the bodies of the executed Baha'is were washed for burial, the marks of torture were discovered. The ribs of Tar6zu'116h Khuzayn were crushed, and his hands were slashed. His legs and thighs had been pierced with a bayonet, and the injuries had turned his skin black and the tissues were swollen. 

 [He was sixty-four when he died.] Suhrdb Ilabfbf's back had been branded with a hot ring — his own — and he had severe burns. The fingers of Husayn KMndil were slashed and his abdomen had been cut open. Dr. Na'imi's back had been broken and Dr. Vaf&i's thighs had been cut open; Suhayl Habfbf's shoulders had been broken and smashed. 

 Husayn Mutlaq had not been tortured  but his body showed the greatest number  of bullet wounds.' 
(They were executed on    

13 June 1981.)            
                          
Tihrdn — June 1981          

 On 23 June 1981 the following Baha'is were executed in Tihifin: Mr. Buzurg 'AlaviyTh, Mr. ffishim 

Farnhsh and Mr. Farhang   
Mavad-dat.  Buzurg 'A1aviy~n

 was a businessman in his mid-sixties who had served on the Local Spiritual 

Assembly of Tihr4n. He    

 managed to leave an extensive account of his imprisonment and interrogation which is, however, too long to extract. H6shim Farndsh was a distinguished  teacher of the Baha'i Faith, and had served on the 

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 of Karaj. Farhang Mavaddat was fifty-six years old, and the father of three adult children. He was described as a 'quiet man, the very image of a Baha'i'. Like Mr. Farniish he served on the Local 

Assembly in Karaj.        

 On 24 June four prominent Baha'is died in front of firing squads in Tihr6n. 

 They were: Dr. Mast Farhangi, a physician and member of the Continental Board of Counsellors, who had a distinguished career in the service of the Baha'i Faith for which he had spent periods in 'IrAq and Turkey, and who had served on the National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 of both fr6n and 'Irtiq; Mr. Baha'u'llah Farid, whose services  in the field of Baha'i literature were particularly  noteworthy; Mr. Yadu'11Th Pfistchi and Mr. Varq6 Tiby6niy~n. 
                          
Mashhad — July 1981         

 Mr. KamMu'd-Dfn Bakht~ivar, a writer, scholar and teacher of the Baha'i Faith, was executed in Mashhad on 26 July; alongside him was Mr. Ni'matuLl4h Mtibp6r-Shahidi, sixty-seven years old, and a representative of the Uman6' company in Mashhad. A public address system was arranged outside the


<p284>

  courtroom during their trial, and the two prisoners made statements concerning their Faith which were thus relayed to the crowd. 
                           
Tabriz — July 1981           

 Seven members of the Local Spiritual Assembly,  together with an Auxiliary Board member and another Baha, died in Tabriz on 30 July. They were: Mr. Maniichihr Kh6di'f, a fifty-five-year-old engineer, survived by a wife and two sons; Dr. Ismd'fl Ziht~b, a dentist in his mid-fifties, survived by a wife, two sons and two daughters; Dr. Masr6r Dakhfli around fifty, with a wife, two daughters and one son; Mr. Husayn Asadu'lhhz6dih, a draughtsman, married, aged over seventy; Mr. Mihdi B~hirf, a family man in his forties; Dr. Parvfz Firiizf, a pharmacist of thirty-eight; Mr. All6hvirdf MithAqi and Mr. 'Abdu'1-'Alf Asady4ri, both teachers, married, in their fifties; and Mr. Julabibu'lhh Ta1~qfqi, an engineer,  married, also in his fifties. 
                           
DdryPn, Isfahdn — September  
198]                       

 'As a result ~f the machinations of some leading clerics, a number of Baha'is were imprisoned in the province of Isfah6n in the summer of 1981. 

 Others became fugitives, and five were executed. 

 The five were inoffensive people, farmers and trappers by occupation. They had often been the subject of persecution, but had borne it with patience and forbearance.' 

 (Over thirty Baha villagers were at this time pressed to recant their faith by an inquisition under the direction of Shaykh Ridau'116h 

Sa'~dati.                  

 'Mr. 'Izzatu'116h 'Atiff was a farmer and resident of Afiis; Bahman 'Atiff was his younger brother. 

Gusht6sb Th4bit R6sikh     

 was from Chigan, and he was a young married man with children. Mr. 'AtAu'11Th RawliAni was from Faridan, and was married with seven children. 

 Mr. Ahmad Rdv~nf was also from Faridan, and had a large family. 

 'They were subject to threats and inducements  in turn. 

 They were permitted to return home [from prison] 

 with the intention of weakening their resolve by exposing them to the pleading of their families. Instead, these encouraged them to remain firm. After this they were not allowed to see their families again. On 11 September, after physical and psychological torture, the five Baha'is were taken from their cells at midnight, blindfolded,  and told to run in the prison yard while shots were fired at their feet. Finally they were riddled with machine-gun bullets. When the son of 'Miff was told he could collect their bodies, he was informed they had been shot while trying to escape. Their relatives were ordered to dig holes and bury the bodies without display. No burial service was allowed, and the corpses were consigned to their graves enclosed in plastic bags. The families were not even allowed to look upon the faces of their dead.' 

  D.  LAST LE'rI'ERS, WILLS 

AND TESTAMENTS             

  Excerpts from the will and testament, and last letters, of Mr. Mihdi Anvari, of Shirdz, while he fasted in prison, prior to his execution on 17 March 1981: ... The value and personality of an individual  are related to his patience and steadfastness in times of adversities. 

 Two men were looking out through the bars of their prison. One looked heavenward and exclaimed, 'What a bright sky! What glittering stars!' 

 The other, gazing down to the earth, remarked, 'V/hat a dusty mess.' 

 If one attains to the recognition of truth, he will never be tormented with worries During our imprisonment, except for brief periods when we were obliged to rest, we have filled our hours with prayers. No moment is passed without our being occupied in the remembrance of God. 

 Outwardly, people may conclude that we are indifferent or stoical, but our hearts are out of our control. Through our devotions we have endeavoured to prepare our hearts to serve as a seat of the divine — I do not know if we are worthy to have our hearts become the recipients of His mercy; however, we desire His bounties and favours The means which change this fire [of tribulation] 

 into a rosegarden are the rains of reliance on God and the sweet breezes of devotion. 'He doeth what He willeth The fire of love cannot be quenched by water nor extinguished by a breeze Our hands are empty but our aspirations and resolve are high. When the test comes the

  resolve of people will be proven and their reliance will be manifested I ardently pray that my deeds be accepted at the Threshold of God. I have nothing to offer but sins, however. Mine was a humble life and I surrender it for the good of humanity. 

 May God grant us the favour of attaining His good pleasure! 

  Last letter of Mr. Hiddyatu'lldh Dihqdni of Sh(rdz, while he fasted in prison, before his execution on 17 March 1981: I thank God that I am able to sacrifice my life for my religion and have committed no crime. I counsel all my children add relatives to be patient and forbearing before the will of God as I, myself, bow my head before His wish and good pleasure. 

 I again yield thanks that I am not being killed because of any crime or transgression that would bring shame to my family. I have, in fact, attained an honour that I never imagined I would deserve to attain. It is a great bounty to be numbered among the twenty-five thousand who have, drunk from the cup of martyrdom. 

 I beg God, the Almighty, to forgive any sins I may have committed in this world and to grant me His mercy. 

 At this moment I sit beside Mr. Mihdi Anvari. I do not know how many hours remain for us. May God assist you and the dear friends all over the world. Be proud; be happy! 

 I leave you under the protection of God Believe me, I am not disturbed or sad but overwhelmed with inexpressible emotions Excerpt from letter of Auxiliary Board member Yadu'lldh Vahdat, of Shirdz, written from prison before his execution on 30 April 1981: 0 God, Thou art aware that I have no other wish than to attain a good end. 

 0 God, grant that we may win Thy good pl§asure. 

 With a sincere heart I seek the good pleasure of God and am prepared for martyrdom.  I am free of worry and I consider martyrdom a source of honour for myself and my children. 

 I beseech Thee, 0 God, by the sacred blood of the Mb, the Exalted One, to cause us to attain a good ending. I supplicate God to grant me such a degree of faith and power as not to cause my footsteps to falter in the face of tribulations, even of martyrdom, and make me fail to attain the glorious end, that greatest honour. 

 I call to mind the poem: the fire of love is alive even when Death arrives; It is a lamp carried from this house to the other! 

 I have prayed tens of times that God may grant me to drink of the wine of martyrdom and that my sacrifice may result in other friends' release and return to the warmth and comfort of theirhomes and families. 

 Yesterday I wrote to my children urging them to pray for me that I might be enabled to partake of the grace of God and offer my blood in His path. 

 With great patience and forbearance, with utmost faith, I express my allegiance to Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith; to the Mb. His unique Forerunner; to 'Abdu'l-Baha,  the Mystery of God, Exemplar and Interpreter of His Teachings; to Shoghi 

El'-fendi,  the Guardian   

 of God's Cause; and to the Universal House of Justice, the infallible institution which today guides the destiny of the Faith; and to all Baha'i institutions. 

 I ask my children to hold, with great love and firmness, memorial meetings for me, and to show to all, but especially the families of my fellow-prisoners, a spirit of steadfastness and forbearance. 

  Last letter of Mr. Sattdr Khushkha, of Shirdz, written from prison before his execution on 30 

April 1981:                

 Have no doubt about my courage and spiritual fortitude. 

 I have passed the days of my life with honour, engaged in worthy efforts. 

 I have tried always to be of help to the weak. 

 Now I do not wish people to have pity for me. I only beg piayers from my relatives and friends — as I repeatedly begged when they visited me in prison — that I shall have a good end. 

 Even in the presence of the religious judge I never uttered a word indicating my weakness. Although I faced the cruellest insults and gravest charges our imprisonment has not been for our personal deeds. 

 Perhaps it is for the good of the Cause of God that at this point in time a few should be imprisoned and some


<p286>
286                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  even attain to the high rank of martyrs, for the liberation of the Baha'i community from the claws of the enemies requires sacrifice on the part of a few of the followers of Baha'u'llah. Therefore, should it be decreed that this humble creature be as a mere point in the great circle of the Cause it would be the greatest honour for him and his family. 

 I am not sad, therefore, but happy and proud. Even if it should be decreed that I be released from this prison I rejoice that in my captivity I have become a new creation. 

 It would then be my hope to serve the Cause with greater devotion and find another outlet through which I might sacrifice. I believe in the decrees of God and know that no leaf stirs but through His will. 

 In this 'pifiace' that my fellow Baha'is and I now occupy, I am not sad; rather, I am happier than ever before in all the years of my life. My family should know that we have been granted an honour; the world and all its wealth cannot bestow an equivalent joy. It is but the grace of God that one as weak and unworthy as I should have been granted such unending honour, the gift of spirituM and eternal life. 

 I ask that you remember me during your devotions so that I may be enabled to remain steadfast to my last breath and fulfil the vows I have made to my Beloved. In this way I can be a source of pride to my family. 

  Last letter of Mr. Suhrdb 

(Muhammad-Bdqir) Habib~    

 of Hamaddn, written from prison before his execution on 14 June 1981. 

 My dear and affectionate Parvin, my dear children, apples of my eye, ft is five minutes to 11 p.m. 01123/3/1360 113 June 19811. We have been summoned by the revolutionary court and called to the field' of martyrdom. My wish is that you may share the tranquillity of conscience and confidence of heart that I feel in these last moments before my physical separation from you. It is stated in our Sacred Writings that we Baha'is should always observe calmness, dignity and moderation. 

 At this hour I express my recognition of the station of the Exalted Lord [the Bab and of the Ancient 

Beauty as Manifestations   

 of God; of 'Abdu'l-Baha as the Centre of God's Covenant; of the Guardian of the Cause of God as the interpreter of the Teachings; and of the station of the Universal 

House of Justice.          

 Farewell, farewell to all of you. I wish you all success. 

 You, dear 11Mm, and Ru'y6, are very fortunate girls to have a mother like mama who is not only your mother but your friend and confidant. I have not much to tell you now. All that I might wish to tell you is already recorded in the Sacred Words of God. Remember me in your devotions; I shall feel close to you in spirit. Always try to erve under the Baha'i administration. 

 As for worldly belongings, I have only an uncompleted house and some unpaid debts. You are welcome to dispose of the house or use it in any way you deem fit. 

 My dear Parvin, take good care of the children. My children, take good care of mama. May your father be sacrificed for you. I hope that you will not cry and mourn for this is against the wish of God. 

 Before I finish, I remind you again that whenever you feel moved to converse with me, read the Words of God. Whatever is in the true essence of my heart is recorded in the Books and Tablets. 

 I have [madej two bracelets which are in the pocket of my short-sleeved shirt in prison. There is a ring in the pocket of the jacket which I am wearing. 

 My dear wife Parvin, I wish you happiness and success during your life. 

 The will of God is that we should be physically separated, but spiritually we are always together. 

 Do not grieve and have no sorrow because of what has happened to me. Be steadfast like a high mountain. My dearest children, 111Pm and Ru'yA, wifl be under your care. 

 Ask forgiveness from all my friends and family. 
     Your affectionate husband, 

SuhrTh

  from the prison to the court premises. They are about to execute all seven of us. Praised be God, we are all in the utmost submission to His will and are most content! 

 God willing, we shall have a good ending. I hereby bid farewell to you dear ones and to other members of the family. 

 I have finished the two tapestries.1 On these I have woven my name, the prison of Hama-dAn  and the date, 138 Baha'i Era. They are among my perso~a1 effects. Please take them from the prison. 

 I have 430 tumThs in cash, a watch, my clothing, and a copy of the charge sheet and of my defence. 

 The rest of my belongings are in the sack. My shaving equipment is by the sack and the blanket is near the bedding. Collect all of them. 

 I have previously written my will and testament. 

 Please follow what is written in it. I am grateful to the believers forthe trouble they have taken on my behalf and beg forgiveness from them all. Kindly express my thanks to all who have come to visit us in prison. 
     I beseech your prayers.    

 I hope that our insignificant blood will water the blessed tree of the Cause of God, that the Faith will soon gain its independence and the Baha'is of Iran their freedom, and that future generations will be able to serve the Cause with the greatest comfort. 

 I had started this evening to make a bracelet for my dear Farfbd and intended to weave her initials, F.M., into the design. 

 Unfortunately I had no time to finish it; it was left behind when we Were transferred here. 

 I wish I had time to weave bracelets for Faribh and AnitA, but this was not to be. Tell T6r6n KhAnum to kiss my brother, Qudrat, for me. The money entrusted to T6rAn Khdnum by Mr. Nu~rat'u'-11Th  may be spent in my memorial meetings in TibrAn and 

HamadAn.                   
    Yours devotedly,

  Last letter of Mr. Suhayl Muhammad-Rd qir Habib!, 

 of Hamaddn, written from prison before his execution on 14 June 1981. He opens with Baha'i prayers. 

 It should be noted that during their yearlong imprisonment  the Baha prisoners in HamadAn occupied themselves  by weaving tapestries. 

        He is God!                 

 o my God! May my life be sacrificed for Thy lovers! Make the blood of this despondent  one to be shed in the way of those who are Thy friends and cause this withered body to become dust on the path trodden by Thy loved ones, 0 Thou Who art my God! 

 ('Abdu'l-Baha) o God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness. I beg of 

Thee, 0 Thou Possessor     

 of Names and Fashioner of the Heavens, by the influence of Thine exalted Word and the potency of Thy Supreme Pen, to aid me with the standards of Thy power and might, and to protect me from the mischief of Thine enemies who have broken Thy Covenant and Testament. 

(Baha'u'llah)              

 I bear witness, 0 my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness  and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. 

 There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. 

(Baha'u'llah)              

  o my relatives! Place your trust in God. Fix your gaze at all times on His bestowals. This is my last exhortation to you. 

 I have reached the fulfilment of my wish.

  that you alone, after my departure, will carry the heavy burden in life. 

 I pray even for those who have judged and wronged me. I hope that the truth of my case will be clarified to all people. 

 My dear Paris6, it is your birthday and I have prayed for you. In fact, I pray for all. Tonight I have had the most glorious prayers of my life. 

 I bid farewell to my brothers and sisters, and to my mother from whom I seek forgiveness.  With my kisses.

 10:45 p.m. 23.3.60 Last will and testament of Mr. Farhang Mavad-dat of Tihrdn, written in Evin prison, before his execution on 23 June 1981: 

    1st Tir 1360               

 This is the will and testament of me Farhang Mavaddat, written in Evin prison. 

 I offer my thanks and praise to God the Almighty and tender my complete recognition of the truth of all the Manifestations of God. 

 I exhort my dear children to rely upon the will of God and to be steadfast in their study of the 

Baha'i Writings. They      

 should also pray for their father. I earnestly request my dear Mihri, who has always been a peerless wife to me to continue to care for my children and to be content with the will of God. 

 Should any property remain in my ownership  it must be divided equally among my children. My body must be buried in the Eternal Rosegarden Baha'i cemetery] 

 in accordance with the Baha'i burial laws. 

 I request my friends to pray for me. If I have committed any wrong or have been disrespectful to any one, I hereby beg forgiveness. 

 My dear family should remember verse from a poem is quoted in one writings of the beloved Guardian, offers comfort: Glad tidings, glad tidings to the lovers That the time of separation shall pass, The time of Oneness shall come And the Lord Himself shall rule. 
     Greetings to my dear father.

 I hope he is pleased with me. 

 that a of the which Farfdih, my dear sister, and her loving children, are always remembered by me. 

 Kisses to my dear ones — niy children Pa-ydm,  NAzi and Nag~mih — and to my dear wife, Mihri. Preserve your bonds of unity and love. 

 At this moment my whole being is infused with a sense of honour; God grant that you also feel proud of your father. 

 I am sorry if my handwriting is not good; it is because I do not have my glasses with me. 

 It is my wish that my children will not wear mourning; rather, they should chant the Tablet of Visitation of 'Abdu'l-Baha on my behalf. 

 In this glorious journey I am in the company  of 

H~shim Farniish and Buzurg 
'Ala-viydn.                

 My dearest Mihrf, are you well pleased with me?

  Last letter of Dr. Masih Farhangi, of Jjihrdn, a member of the Continental 

Board of Counsellors      

 for Asia, written from prison before his execution on 24 June 1981: date: 60/4/3 My dear Wife, At this last moment of my transitory life, when I am on my way to the realm of eternity, I bid you farewell. I beg you to accept, with great patience and forbearance, what God has willed. Be thankful; be patient! 

 During our forty-four years together I have felt nothing but tranquillity and comfort. I had no wish except companionship with you. I hope you are pleased with me and will not deny me your loving prayers. 'I have come from God and to God do I return.' 

 The beginning and the end of all is in the Hand of Providence; faith in God is a balm to the hearts and a cause of tranquillity of the souls and of our beings. 

 I am greatly relieved at this moment, content and pleased. I yield my thanks to God that He has vouchsafed to me this final overwhelming blessing. Praised be God, the Lord of all the worlds! If my hands are empty of the treasures of the world, they have always been raised in prayers and thanksgiving to

  Him. And so, at this moment, my hands are raised in gratitude to my Lord. 

 I sent my watch through one of the guards to Ward No. 2. They are supposed to give it to you with other of my belongings. 

 I have less than 400 tum~ins in cash in my pocket. 

 Our wedding ring and the Greatest Name were also given to the guards in order to be kept in the family. 

 Give my earnest greetings to all my dear ones. I am pleased with all of them. In the realm above I shall beg for all of you welfare and happiness. Friends and relatives are in my prayers at this moment. I think of them, one and all, and see them in my mind's eye. Console  Tahirih Kh6num and my other sisters. 

 If possible, have prayers said at the graveside of my parents. God be with you. 
    Yours affectionately,

            Ridvan 1978 — RidvTh 1983

                   He is God

  0  LORD my God! 0 Thou Helper of the feeble, Succourer of the poor and Deliverer r of the helpkss who turn unto Thee. 

  With utmost lowliness I raise my suppliant hands to Thy kingdom of beauty and fervently call upon Thee with my inner tongue, saying: 0 God, my God! Aid me to adore Thee; strengthen my loins to serve Thee; assist me by Thy grace in my servitude to Thee; suffer me to remain steadfast in my obedience to Thee; pour forth upon me the liberal effusions of Thy bounty, let the glances of the eye of Thy Thving-kindness be directed towards me, and immerse me in the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Grant that I may be confirmed in my allegiance to Thy Faith, and bestow upon me a fuller measure of certitude and assurance, that I may wholly dispense with the world, may turn my face with entire devotion towards Thy face, be reinforced by the compelling power of proofs and testimonies, and, invested with majesty and power, may pass beyond every region of heaven and earth. Verily Thou art the Merciful, the All-Glorious, the Kind, the Compassionate. 

  0 Lord! These are the survivors of the martyrs, that company of blessed souls. 

 They have sustained every tribulation and displayed patience in the face of grievous injustice. They have forsaken all comfort and prosperity, have willingly submitted to dire suffering and adversity in the path of Thy love, and are still held captive in the clutches of their enemies who continually torment them with sore torment, and oppress them because they walk steadfastly in Thy straight path. There is no one to help them, no one to befriend them. Apart from the ignoble and the wicked, there is no one to associate and consort with them. 

  0 Lord! These souls have tasted bitter agony in this earthly life and have, as a sign of their love for the shining beauty of Thy countenance and in their eagerness to attain Thy celestial kingdom, tolerated every gross indignity that the people of tyranny have inflicted upon them. 

  o Lord! Fill their ears with the verses of divine assistance and of a speedy victory, and deliver them from the oppression of such as wield terrible might. Withhold the hands of the wicked, and leave not these souls to be torn by the claws and teeth of fierce beasts, for they are captivated by their bye for Thee, entrusted with the mysteries of Thy holiness, stand humbly at Thy door and have attained to Thine exalted precinct. 

  O Lord! Graciously reinforce them with a new spirit; illumine their eyes by enabling them to behold Thy wondrous evidences in the gloom of night; destine for them all good that aboundeth in Thy Kingdom of eternal mysteries; make them as brilliant stars shining over all regions, luxuriant trees laden with fruit and branches moving in the breezes of dawn. 

  Verily, Thou art the Bountiful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent, the Unconstrained. 

 There is none other God but Thee, the God of love and tender mercy, the All-Glorious, , the Ever-Forgiving.

     G. BAHA'11 CHILDREN IN TIME OF PERSECUTION

  Excerpts from letters written by Mrs. Zhinj~s Mahmadi1 10 June 1981 Dear Friends, We are extremely busy these days and it pains me to think of not being able to write to you. 

 We have so many overwhelming stories to relate, which are so glorious that one feels guilty about not being able to write them. 

 One of the greatest and most important features of the present persecutions is the tests which are facing the Baha'i children. 

 So much is written and told about the outstanding perseverance and degree of devotion of the adult believers, but little is said about our dear children — their encounters with difficulties, their courage, and their heroic deeds. 

 It is unbelievable that human beings could ever think of pressuring innocent children of such tender age in the way the people in the schools of Ir6n are doing at this time. 

 Thousands  of Baha'i pupils are facing such inhuman afflictions. Most of them are very studious, are more knowledgeable than other children of their age, and have special insight. Many people, including their teachers, look at them with awe. 

 The enemies of the Cause do not deny that the Baha'i children are generally much more advanced than their fellow classmates, but they are not pleased with this fact. Sometimes it even happens that when government authorities complain about the activities of the Baha'is, they cite as examples the actions of our little ones and how they confront their Muslim teachers and fellow pupils. 

 What do these children do that makes them deserve these pressures? Most Baha children know their Islamic religious lessons better than all their fellow students. They can read the Qur'an and interpret it better than their Muslim counterparts, sometimes even better than their teachers! The highest marks in Islamic religious study are given to the 

Baha'i children. Their     

 teachers are often very surprised  to note that they excel in competitions in the reading of the Qur'an and in religious instruction examinations. Yes, they are frequently  surprised, but at the same time they are extremely resentful. 

Mrs. Zhini~s Mahrn~df      

 was martyred in Tihr~n on 

27 December 1981.          

 When the teachers become angry, they challenge the Baha'i students unfairly. 

 The parents of these children ask their instructors how they have the audacity to confront children of ten or eleven years, and their reply is that the Baha'i children sometimes know more than they do. 

 They complain that in their classes the Baha'i children are occasionally  made prayer leaders and are nicknamed by their fellow students as 'Ayatollahs' because  their understanding of the Qur'Th is deep and their beautiful explanations of its verses overshadow those of the teachers. 
        This is exactly the problem!

 Baha children with such intelligence, understanding and knowledge are not favoured by the ideologists of the Ministry of Education. 

 According to them, such children should be 'guided to the right path'. It is certain that this Ministry has adopted a detailed and menacing plan to brainwash the Baha'i children. We have so much evidence of such a plan! It is surprising to note that the authorities of the present r6gime are spending so much time, energy and money to prepare themselves on ways to confront our young children. It is not uncommon  for two or three instructors of religious classes or trained ideologists of the Ministry of Education, as well as a number of students, to join forces and suddenly attack a Baha'i child of ten or eleven years. With all their power they try to shatter the very foundation of his beliefs. They will argue with him for hours, and even use unfair methods to 'guide' him. They are bewildered when they realize, however,  that all their efforts are in vain, and they are wonderstruck at the replies they receive from these young ones, which include a number  of verses from the Qur'an and quotations from the Baha'i Writings. 

 Sometimes such discussions, between say a teacher in his thirties and his Baha'i pupil of ten or eleven years of age, take place in the classroom. 

 The teacher begins with a barrage of insults and calumnies against the Faith. The child, of course, does not passively accept these insults — he reacts! And, his protests are the beginning of a public discussion about the Faith between him and his teacher. 

 Impressive  responses are given by the Baha'i


<p332>
332                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  child, which often makes the teacher speechless. 

 This delights the other children, who applaud and sometimes cry 'Hurrah!' 

 for the student who has overcome the mighty instructor. 

 The teacher then becomes angrier and he leaves the classroom and consults with other teachers, who come to his rescue. They call for the Baha'i child at an hour when he has other classes, such as gymnastics or mathematics,  to discuss the Faith. Here are three of them attacking one young child! They argue and argue. What a fair encounter! 

 The Baha children in fr6n have a full share of the persecutions befalling the Baha'is in that country. 

 Even the performances of tots in the kindergarten — their courage, their chanting of prayers by heart, their singing of Baha'i songs, and their good behaviour — make some of the teachers angry, and others, while irate, are filled with awe and admiration. 

 We pray that these children will always be able to withstand this unjust pressure. We have hundreds of examples to relate, but here are just a few. 

  1.  Shmf is five years old. 

 He is preparing himself in the kindergarten to be admitted into Grade 1 next year. He knows by heart six prayers, the short Obligatory Prayer, and a number of extracts from the Baha'i Writings. 

 He is intelligent, wellbehaved, and quick to learn, and he recites what he has learned very eloquently. 

  An inspector was sent to his school by the Ministry of Education, and the teacher in order to boast how successful he had been in teaching the children in his class, called S4mf to recite the verses he had learned. SAmf's performance astonished the inspector.  At the end, the teacher instructed S6mi to recite a poem which began with the sentence, 'I am a Muslim child.' 

 S6mf gazed silently at his teacher without uttering a word. The teacher repeated his instruction, but Sdmi remained silent. The teacher was very surprised and became uneasy in front of the inspector. He could not understand why Shmi, who had always excelled in learning and reciting poetry, now remained silent, and so he asked the reason. 

 Srtmf replied, 'Because I am not a Muslim, I am a Baha!' 

 The inspector left the room in anger and complained to the headmaster, who called S6mi's mother to the school. She was warned that S6mi should be instructed not to teach the Faith at the school. The mother did not know what had happened, but when she found out she naturally told SAmi that he should be more careful and not behave the way he did. 

 But little S~mi, who had learned in the Baha'i community what it meant to be steadfast, could not accept this and replied, 'I am a Baha'i and I will always tell people that I am, and if they bother me I will go to the nearest police station and complain!' 

  2.  Ihhi is eight years old. Her father was one of the three recent martyrs in Shir6z. She is the only one of his children who was allowed to meet with her father on the day before his execution. 

  The day after the funeral of her beloved father, Ihhi took to her school flowers and sweets to distribute to the teacher and her classmates. The teacher was surprised and asked if it is a Baha custom to do such a thing when one's father is killed? The little girl replied, 'My father was not killed, he was martyred!' 

  3.  Akram, the eleven-year-old daughter of one of the seven martyrs of Yazd, is another example of such heroism. After her father and the six others were martyred, she went to school and the teacher asked the students in her class to write an essay about their experiences during the summer vacation. 

 Akram wrote a sweet and factual essay about what had happened to her family during the summer — how the Revolutionary  Guards and others came to their house and took her beloved father away, how they kept him in prison for some time, how she met him~ in prison, and finally about his martyrdom. Her essay was so moving that it brought tears to the eyes of the teacher and the children in her class. However, since the word 'Baha'i' was written in the essay, the teacher, even though moved, was angry. She took the essay to the headmistress, and a few days later the headmistress called Akram to her


<p333>

  room. She said, 'Your essay deserves to receive the highest mark, but since you mentioned the word "Baha" a few times, you should withdraw it.' Akram replied, 'I was supposed to write about my experiences during the summer. Whatever I have written is the exact truth. My father was killed because he was a Baha'i!' 

  The headmistress threatened Akram with dismissal because of what she had said, but told her that because her mother had lost a husband, she would be permitted to remain in school. Eventually, the headmistress  demanded that Akram write an essay on some other subject, which she did, and she was given an excellent grade. 

  4.  ArmAn, eleven years old, is another hero of the Faith. Three prejudiced and cruel teachers, one of whom was violent, argued with him and threatened and abused him because of his being a Baha. When they felt they had punished him. 

 adequately in this fashion, they took him to a room, gave him a booklet which was written against the Faith, and compelled him to write repeatedly from this booklet certain sentences which attacked the Faith in offensive language. 

 This punishment became so great that ArmAn developed severe headaches, which the doctors said were caused by nervous pressure. 

  5.  Ru'yi has just become fifteen years old and is in the first year of secondary school. Her school is not in a remote village where prejudiced and uneducated people might be expected to live. 

 It is in one of the prosperous localities north of Tihrin and is supposedly more civilized. When this school had been opened for a few years, an instructor of religion entered a classroom of new students, and first asked, 'Is there anyone in this class who does not belong to the true religion?' Nobody replied. 

 The instructor then said, 'What I meant was, is there a Baha'i in the class?' 

 Ru'y~ stood up and announced that she was a Baha'i. 

 The teacher then said in abusing and insulting language, 'Let it be known to all of you that Ru'y6 is defiled and untouchable and none of you are to have any contact with her.' She demanded that Ru'y~. sit in the back of the room at a desk by herself, and those who were sitting at that particular desk were given another place. 

 The instructor  stated that this arrangement was to be observed until the end of the year and that nobody was allowed to sit next to her. 

  I have asked some of these children to write about their experiences and the types of discussions they have had with their teachers and fellow students. 

 A beautiful compilation has been made, and although it has been composed by these children in simple language,  it demonstrates the depth of their understanding of the Faith and their profound love for Baha'u'llah. 
                           
        3 November 1981            

  My dear Brother, I do not know where to begin, there is too much to be written about. In these days of constant struggle our children are in the vanguard. They always produce wonders. What is transpiring here is exceptional. Where were these heroes before? They must have existed but it is only now that they are able to manifest their spiritual potentialities, to reveal their precious essence, to prove the validity of the spiritual training they received from their families. 

 Most of our children, in different degrees, have now been given opportunities in their schools to demonstrate their heroism. In the Land of Ya [Yazd], the home of the brave, opportunities abound. So far over one hundred  of our children have been expelled from their schools because they are Baha'is. Their dismissal, which ordinarily one would expect would be the cause of sadness, has produced in them a joy and vitality which I cannot describe. 

 Because of their response to their dismissal, all Yazd is shaken. Our precious children have shown such courage as to have caused all Yazd to wonder. It should be said that all these children are among the very best students in the cityThey attained the highest marks, were known for their exemplary conduct  and were recognized as being exceptionally talented and intelligent. 

 This has given rise to the first question among the people of Yazd: Why should the best be expelled? 

 The second question in the minds of those


<p334>
334                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  who have expelled them arises from the courage and perseverance of these young ones. Although they were dismissed from school in an atmosphere charged with hatred and prejudice, our children have, with a sense of pride and a consciousness of being related to the followers of Baha'u'llah, collected their books and school bags with placid joy and left the school, smiling and walking with a light step, while their non-BahA'f school friends wept for them. 

  I have to interrupt this letter as the telephone is ringing. 
                           
(Later)                    

 I have been informed that six members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihr~n have been arrested. 

 Never a moment of peace! What strength is required to be able to concentrate our thoughts and compose our feelings! 

 I was writing about our children. The believers of Yazd have told us that there are very few Baha'i children in the city who are unhappy and cry — they are those who as yet have not been expelled from the schools. 

 The teachers, and even headmasters, are extremely upset by the instruction from the Ministry to dismiss Baha'i children. One headmaster decided to resign after receiving the order to dismiss his Baha'i students but he was firmly warned against tendering his resignation.  However, on the day of the dismissal of the Baha'i students he absented himself from school, having clearly stated that he had no wish to witness such an unjust action. 
                           
(Later)                    

 I have been interrupted by another phone call. 

 A husband and wife in Karaj have been executed by firing squad for their 'Zionist' activities. 

 My thoughts immediately go out to Mr. and Mrs. who are imprisoned in Karaj. 

 Is this news true? Is it about them? Until we can verify this report, what anxiety we have to endure! The air is thick with rumours these days, none of them good. God knows what consternation fills our minds until we are able to verify the truth or falsehood of these rumours. 

  I'm sorry — I was diverted again. This is what is happening to our children: On the appointed day the teacher asks the class whether there are any Baha among the students. 

 Our children — our patient, wellbehaved,  faithful and steadfast children —  stand up and with great pride and courage introduce themselves as Baha'is. 

 They are then sent to the office of the headmaster. 

 The teachers, and sometimes the headmasters, are embarrassed and sad. In the office of the headmaster the children are first asked to deny their faith and continue their studies. 

 These requests are in many instances expressed with love and concern because the staff in the school really like these distinguished and outstanding students and do not want to lose them. But what they hear from these children surprises them. 

 The children announce that they are Baha'is, that they personally decided to be Baha'is, that they cannot lie and deny their faith, and that they are proud of what they believe! 

 At this point the headmaster and teachers have no alternative but to sign the order expelling them. 

 These children range in age from seven to seventeen or eighteen. It is a sight to see how cheerfully the Baha'i children leave the school with no sense of shame, while their non-Bahd'i  fellow students look on thoughtfully, some even weeping. Disturbances occur in the classroom after the Baha'i children leave, and challenging discussions take place between the remaining pupils and their teachers. 

 The children put questions until the end of the school day and the discussion is carried out to the streets. The non-Bah&i students invariably  ask: 'Isn't it true that we are supposed to have freedom of belief? What's wrong with the Baha'i children — don't they worship God and pray? 
Why are they being dismissed?'

 The children carry their questions home. Their queries spread to all parts of the city and are taken up in the streets and the bazaars. 

 The parents of the dismissed Baha children  — themselves the essence of patience and steadfastness — exclaim with pride: 'What we have failed to achieve, our children are now achieving!' 

 They praise the children with candour and love. 

 I doubt whether in the history of any society such honour has been heaped upon children of so tender an age. 

 The parents remark: 'It is true that in the 138 years since the beginning of our Faith we have endured many hardships, but we have never


<p335>

  been so successful as our children in proclaiming to the masses of the people of Yazd the exalted character of the Baha'i Revelation, nor have our actions resulted, as have our children's, in creating an atmosphere in which the Faith is being discussed so openly among the people in the streets and bazaars. 

 Our persecuted children have succeeded in breaking through the barrier of prejudice of the hardhearted people of this city.' 

 The parents go on to exclaim: 'The events of the past have made us conservative and cautious; it is our children who have changed the atmosphere.' This change had its early beginnings last year when the martyrs shed their blood on the soil of Yazd. This change cannot be measured by existing standards. 

 A programme of study has been arranged for our children at home; they are learning with great speed and progressing in all fields of knowledge. 

 They will surely surpass their fellow students who are still in school. 

 More important than this, we have promised ourselves to help these children become so well versed in the Holy Writings that each will become the envy of scholars. 

 There is no doubt that this will come to pass. 

 Let me tell you something about the adults. The Baha'i men and women — particularly the women — are facing tribulations with such equanimity that no comparable example can be found even among the legendary heroines of the past. These women are in fact creating new legends through their patience, steadfastness, love and detachment. 

 They have conquered  the hearts of everyone and won the praises of all. 

 The forces of hatred have been vanquished by the power of their faith. 

 When they are looted of their property, furniture and belongings they part with them as they would with outworn dolls and playthings, looking on as though they were mere spectators.  They shower love upon those who come to take away their belongings as might an affectionate and indulgent parent who with a smile will give a worthless toy or plaything to a naughty child. It appears that they even enjoy Xhe naughtiness of these children. 

 Such behaviour has greatly influenced the hearts of the looters who are not great in number. Mr. K. —  that heartless man who is the leader of those who are executing the Baha'is and confiscating their properties, and whose main task is to uproot the Faith in Yazd — is often seen entering the homes of the Baha'is, knocking upon their doors at any hour of the day or night. He h~is become such a familiar figure that the Baha'is jest with him, saying, 'You have become one of us!' 

 He even knows the nicknames of the Baha'i children. If he does not make an appearance for some time the Baha'is tell him they miss him. Although Mr. K. comes to take away their property or to send their loved ones to prison, they are pleasant to him, joke with him, enquire about his health. They even tell him that one day he should become a Baha'i in order to understand the significance of what he is now doing. 

 the Baha of Yazd say that this unfeeling man, Mr. K., is treated by them as a member of the family. When he comes to seize their furniture the young men of the family help him carry out the heavier pieces; when he arrives they invite him to join them at the table and give him sweets, fruits, even meals. After he has eaten he goes around the house and selects the furniture he wants to take away. If he does not have a vehicle available he gestures toward the selected articles of furniture and tells the owner, 'These are my trust with you; keep them safely until I return.' He sometimes even proposes that the family might buy back the furniture from him.The behaviour of the longsuffering Baha'is in these appalling circumstances  is unprecedented. 

 They recognize that they are indeed giving away worthless trinkets, as to an ignorant child. 

 The Baha'is whose homes have been confiscated do not leave the city but move to a small dwelling place, wherever they can find refuge Almost all the Baha'i men have been required to leave the city and this has provided  the children, youth and women an opportunity to prove their courage and valour. 
How proud we are of them!  

 What a creation has Baha'u'llah raised up! Such conduct has been unheard of, even in legends. When the Baha'is of Yazd themselves relate these events they express amazement at the change in themselves. 

 The people of Yazd have the reputation of being economical and thrifty; it is said that two families of Yazd could fight between themselves over posses

  sion of a valueless stick of wood. But look at them now! They have given up everything to show their love for Baha'u'llah. 

 When one extends sympathy to them they express surprise,  remarking that what they have parted with is worthless. They do not even denounce the thieves and looters when referring to them. 

 I cannot overlook mentioning a mother and daughter who are in prison — they are examples.  The daughter is sixty years old and the mother is over eighty. 

 The fact of imprisoning such elderly innocent women is in itself very strange, but it has been done. These women are Baha'is of Zoroastrian backgro9nd. 

 All their possessions were confiscated  and they are now in the women's prison with over one hundred prisoners of all kinds. 

 A few months ago a release order was issued for the mother, but she refused to leave unless her daughter was also released, so they remained in prison. 

 Only ten days ago the authorities at last gave permission for them to receive occasional visitors. 

 Baha'i visitors have witnessed the old woman embracing and demonstrating affection to the policewoman, before she would come forward to meet her visitors. During the course of the visit the old woman noticed a young male guard who was supposed to control the visitors.  In her special Parsi — Yazdi accent she maternally addressed complimentary remarks to him with such obvious love and sincerity that the young man was visibly uncomfortable and ashamed. 

 She remarked to her visitors, 'I always thought that mothers could really love only their own children, but I have come to feel genuine love for these young men who are on duty.' The young guard had nothing to say, but stood with bowed head. 

 The fire of sincere love is melting the ice of hatred. 

 Then with remarkable candour this old woman, more than eighty years of age, said to her visitors, 'Tell everybody that Baha'u'llah has enabled me to perform miracles.  Tell them that the Baha'i prayers which I copy out for the sick ones in this prison cause them to become cured.' She related how one of the guards sought her out excitedly to tell her his story. 'I was searching for you,' he said. 'I wanted to tell you that the prayers you wrote out for me and my wife a year ago have been answered and our wish to have a baby is fulfilled. This has made it unnecessary for me to divorce my wife for her inability to conceive a child.' 

 In the evenings the women prisoners crowd together around the mother and daughter and ask them to tell them stories and speak to them. They speak most beautifully and with such a sweet accent that nobody wants to go to sleep. Even the guards do not object. 

 When Sarafr6z, the mother, has a visitor, she begs them to bring fruit from her orchard in order to make a feast for the prisoners. The old woman does not know that her orchard and other properties have been confiscated. But the visitors know what to do. They purchase large quantities of fruit so she can provide hospitality to her fellow prisoners. When have you heard stories like this? 
     Glad tidings! Glad tidings!

 The climate of this city in the midst of the desert is changed and the perfume of the love of God has filled all corners. In my next letter I will write you more such stories — if I am still alive, or free

         12. LETTER FROM THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE
        OF JUSTICE TO IRANIAN BAHA'IS LIVING
                    OUTSIDE IRAN

  ON 10 February 1980, the Universal House of Justice addressed a letter in Persian to the Iranian believers residing in countries outside Iran. The National Spiritual Assembly of the United Kingdom prepared a translation into English, the text of which was sent to all National Spiritual Assemblies on 29 July 1980 with the following explanatory note: 'The message includes several quotations from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi hitherto untranslated into English. The English text of these passages, as they appear in the attached translated message, have been checked and approved at the World Centre, and may be regarded by the friends as authorized texts. Passages previously published and included in the message can be found in the following publications: The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 146 and p. 33; The Promised Day is Come, p. 1; and Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitdb-i-A A qdas, p. 35 and p. 219.' 

     10 February 1980           

  To  the dear Iranian believers resident in other countries throughout the world In these tumultuous days when the lovers of the Best Beloved are remote from their homeland, associating with their fellow-believers in other lands, and participating in the services of the loyal supporters throughout the world, we felt it necessary to convey our thoughts to those distinguished friends, with absolute sincerity and affection, and invite them to that which we believe can guarantee their tranquillity and happiness, as well as their eternal salvation and redemption; so that with firm steps and sure hearts they may, God willing, withstand the onslaughts which have and will afffict all the countries of the globe. Thus they may fix their gaze on the dawn of the fulfilment of the soul-vitalizing promises of God and remain certain that behind these dark clouds the Sun of the Will of God is shining resplendent from its height of glory and might. 

 Before long these dark clouds of contention, negligence, fanaticism, and rebellion  shall disperse, the day of victory shall dawn above the horizon, and a new age shall illumine the world. It should not be surmised that the events which have taken place in all corners of the globe, incuding the sacred land of fran, have occurred as isolated incidents without any aim and purpose. According to the words of our beloved Guardian: 'The invisible hand is at work and the convulsions taking place on earth are a prelude to the proclamation of the Cause of God.' This is but one of the mysterious forces of this supreme Revelation which is causing the limbs of mankind to quake and those who are drunk with pride and negligence to be thunderstruck and shaken. To the truth of this testifies the sacred verse: The world's equilibrium hat,'i been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order, and the repeated warnings of the Pen of ~the Most High, such as: The world is encircled with calamities. Even if at times some good may be evident, it is inevitable that a great calamity followeth —  and yet no one on earth hath perceived its origin The world is in travail and its agitation waxeth day by day. Its face is turned towards waywardness and uhbelief. Such shall be its plight that to disclose it now would not be meet and seemly. 

 Its perversity will long continue. And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake. Then and only then will the Divine Standard be unfurled and the Nightingale of Paradise warble its melody. 

  Similarly, the Pen of the Centre of the Covenant has repeatedly prophesied the in


<p358>
358                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  tolerable calamities which must beset this wayward humanity ere it heeds the life-giving Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

  Chaos and confusion are daily increasing in the world. They will attain such intensity as to render the frame of mankind unable to bear them. Then will men be awakened and become aware that religion is the impregnable stronghold and the manifest light of the world, and its laws, exhortations and teachings the source of life on earth. 

  Every discerning eye clearly sees that the early stages of this chaos have daily manifestations  affecting the structure of human society;  its destructive forces are uprooting lime-honoured institutions which were a haven and refuge for the inhabitants of the earth in bygone days and centuries, and around which revolved all human affairs. The same destructive forces are also deranging the political, economic, scientific, literary, and moral equilibrium of the world and are destroying the fairest fruits of the present civilization. Political machinations of those in authority have placed the seal of obsolescence upon the root-principles of the world's order. 

 Greed and passion, deceit, hypocrisy, tyranny, and pride are dominating features afflicting human relations. 

 Discoveries and inventions, which are the fruit of scientific and technological advancements,  have become the means and tools of mass extermination and destruction and are in the hands of the ungodly. 

 Even music, art, and literature, which are to represent and inspire the noblest sentiments and highest aspirations and should be a source of comfort and tranquillity for troubled souls, have strayed from the straight path and are now the mirrors of the soiled hearts of this confused, unprincipled, and disordered age. Perversions such as these shall result in the ordeals which have been prophesied by the Blessed Beauty in the following words: Every day a new calamity will seize the earth and a fresh tormenting trial will appear. The day is approaching when its [civilization's] 

 flame will devour the cities. 

 In such an afflicted time, when mankind is bewildered and the wisest of men are perplexed  as to the remedy, the people of Baha, who have confidence in His unfailing grace and divine guidance, are assured that each of these tormenting trials has a cause, a purpose, and a definite result, and all are essential instruments for the establishment of the immutable  Will of God on earth. In other words, on the one hand humanity is struck by the scourge of His chastisement which will inevitably bring together the scattered and vanquished tribes of the earth; and on the other, the weak few whom He has nurtured under the protection of His loving guidance are, in this formative age and period of transition, continuing to build amidst these tumultuous waves an impregnable stronghold which will be the sole remaining refuge for those lost multitudes. Therefore, the dear friends of God who have such a broad and clear vision before them are not perturbed by such events, nor are they panic-stricken by such thundering sounds, nor will they face such convulsions with fear and trepidation, nor will they be deterred, even for a moment, from fulfilling their sacred responsibilities. 

 One of their sacred responsibilities is to exemplify in their lives those attributes which are acceptable at His 

Sacred Threshold. Others   

 must inhale from them the holy fragrances  of the homeland of Baha'u'llah, the land which is the birthplace of sell-sacrificing martyrs and devoted lovers of the Omnipotent Lord. They must not forget that Baha'is throughout the world expect much from the Iranian believers. 

 They should hearken to the life-giving clarion call which their Peerless Beloved has given to the friends in frdn: It is the wish of 'Abdu'l-Baha and that which attracts His good-pleasure, and indeed it is His binding command that Baha'is, in all matters, even in small daily transactions and dealings with others, should act in accordance with the Divine Teachings. 

 He has commanded us not to be content with lowliness, humility and meekness but rather to become man(festaiions of utter nothingness and selflessness. Loyalty and fidelity, compassion and love are exhortations of old. In this supreme Dispensation the people of Baha are called upon to sacrifice their very lives. 

 Notice the extent to which the friends have been required, in the 

Sacred Epistles and Tablets

 as well as in our Beloved's Testament, to be righteous, well-wishing, forbearing, sanctified, pure, detached from


<p359>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                359

  all else save God, severed from the trappings of this world and adorned with the mantle of a goodly character and divine attributes. Before all else they must sanctify their hearts and purify their motives, otherwise all efforts in furthering qny enterprise will be fruitless. They must eschew affectation and imitation, for every man of understanding will instantly detect their loathsome odour. 

 They must not neglect the special times they should set aside for meditation, reflection and prayer, for without the blessings and confirmations of God, success, progress and development are difficult, nay impossible. You cannot tin-agine  what influence is exerted on the hearts of men by genuine love, sincerity and purity of motive, but such an effect can only be produced when strivings and efforts are made every day by every individual. Let not the stranger, the envious and the enemy have cause to attribute the sublimity of the Faith in the past and in its early days to the appearance  of outstanding and sanctified souls and the perseverance of martyrs whose absence today implies the necessary decline, weakening,  scattering and annihilation of the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.      

  We beseech God to aid and assist them daily to centre their attentions on these divine admonitions and to tread the path of faithfulness  so as to secure abiding happiness. 

 Another of the sacred responsibilities of the believers is their spiritual commitment to serve God's Sacred Threshold at all times and under all conditions so that they may dedicate the few, fleeting days of their lives — particularly in this age of transition — to the Cause of God, unmindful of the vicissitudes of fortune, trusting in Providence, and relieved of worries and anxieties. Witness what joyful tidings the Pen of the Most High has given to such blessed souls: Whatsoever occurreth in the world of being is light for His loved ones and fire for the people of sedition and strife. 

 Even if all the losses of the world were to be sustained by one of the friends of God, he would still profit thereby, whereas true loss would be borne by such as are wayward, ignorant and contemptuous. 

 Although the author of the following saying had intended it otherwise, yet We find it pertinent to the operation of God's immutable Will: 'Even or odd, thou shalt win the wager'. The friends of God shall win and profit under all conditions, and shall attain true wealth'. In fire they remain cold, and from water they emerge dry. 

 Their affairs are at variance with the affairs of men. 

 Gain is their lot; whatever the deal. To this test ifi eth every wise one with a discerning eye, and every fair-minded one with a hearing ear. 

  Yet another sacred duty is that of clinging to the cord of moderation in all things, lest they who are to be the essence of detachment and moderation be deluded by the trappings of this nether world or set their hearts on its adornments and waste their lives. 

 If they are wealthy they should make these bestowals a means of drawing nigh unto God's Threshold, rather than being so attached to them that they forget the admonitions of the Pen of the Most High. 

 The Voice of Truth has said: Having attained the stage of fulfilment and reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy in the estimation of men of wisdom. If wealth and prosperity become the means of service at God's Threshold it is highly meritorious, otherwise it would be better to avoid them. Turn to the Book of the Covenant, the Hidden Words, and other Tablets, lest the cord of your salvation become a rope of woe which will lead to your own destruction. 

 How numerous are those negligent souls, particularly from among your own compatriots, who have been deprived of the blessings of faith and true understanding. 

 Witness how, no sooner had they attained their newly-amassed wealth and status, than they became so bewitched by them as to forget the virtues and true perfections of man's station. They clung to their empty and fruitless lifestyle. 

 They had naught else but their homes, their commercial success, and their ornamental trappings of which to be proud. Behold their ultimate fate. Many a triumphal arch was reduced to a ruin, many an imperial palace was converted into a barn. Many a day of deceit turned into a night of despair. Vast treasures changed hands and, at the end of their lives, they were left only with tears of loss and regret. all that perisheth


<p360>
360                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and changeth is not and hath never been, worthy of attention, except to a recognized measure.' 

 Therefore the people of BaM must not fall prey to the corruption of the ruthless but rather cling to contentment and moderation.  They must make their homes havens for the believers, folds for their gatherings and centres for the promulgation of His Cause and the diffusion of His love, so that people of all strata, whether high or low, may feel at home and be able to consort in an atmosphere of love and fellowship. 

 Another sacred responsibility of those dear Iranian friends now living abroad is to consult with the 

Assemblies and Baha'i      

 Institutions so that their settlement in needy areas may help the establishment and consolidation of the Faith. They must serve on the pioneer front wherever they reside. They must now allow themselves to be drawn to and congregate in areas where their relatives or friends reside, unaware of the pioneering needs of the Faith. Praised be God that, through the blessings of the Greatest Name, the believers have been imbued with a love and unity which transcends the ties of kinship and friendship and overcomes the barriers of language and culture. Therefore there is no need for the Iranian friends to congregate in one place. Often such a congregation creates problems. For example, should the number of Iranians exceed the number of native believers in a community, they would inadvertently bring about such difficulties as might hamper the progress of the Cause of God, and the world-conquering religion of the AbM Beauty might appear to others as a religion which is limited and peculiar to Iranians. This could but lead to a waste of time and the disenchantment of both Baha'is and non-Bah&is. Under such circumstances the dear Iranian friends would neither enjoy their stay in that place nor would they be able to serve the Faith in a befitting manner. It is our ardent hope that, wherever possible, the Iranian friends may settk in those towns or villages which are pioneering goals, so that through their stay the foundation of the Cause may be strengthened. 

 They must encourage each other to pioneer and disperse in accordance with the teaching plans wherever they reside, and sacrifice the happiness and joy which they may otherwise obtain from companionship with each other for the sake of the vital interests of the Cause. 

 Another of the sacred duties incumbent upon the believers is that of avoiding participation in political discussions and intrigues which have become popular nowadays. 

 What have the people of Baha to do with political contention and controversy? With absolute certainty they must prove to the world that Baha'is, by virtue of their beliefs, are loyal citizens of whatever country they reside in and are far removed from the machinations of conspirators and the perpetrators of destruction  and chaos. 

 Their ideal is the happiness of all the peoples of the world and sincere and wholehearted service to them. In administrative positions they are obedient to their governments and carry out their duties with the utmost honesty and trustworthiness. 

 They regard no faction as superior to another and prefer no individual above another. They oppose no one, for the Divine Pen has prohibited sedition and corruption and enjoined peace and harmony upon us. For more than a century Baha'is have proven by their deeds that they regard servitude and service to their fellow man as being more worthy than the privileges of power which can be gained from politics. In administering their own affairs, they rely on God rather than on the influence of those in power and authority. Particularly in these days when the enemies of the Faith have afflicted the Cause in the sacred land of Iran with the darts of calumny and slander on every side, the dear Iranian friends should be vigilant, both in their contact  with other Iranians abroad and with people in generaL and behave in such a way as to leave no doubt as to the independence and nonalignment of the Baha and their good will to all people, whether in fr6n or elsewhere. 

 They must not give a new excuse to cause trouble to those mischief-makers who have always sought to further their own unworthy  ends by making the Baha'i community a target for their malicious accusations. 

 0 beloved of God, and compatriots of the AbhA Beauty! Your relationship to the Blessed Perfection merits befitting gratitude. Having appreciated the true value of so inestimable a bounty, your forefathers regarded  the offering of their lives in the path of their kind Beloved as easy to make. They

  were put in chains, became captives of the sword, lost their homes and belongings, yet no sound was heard from their lacerated throats but the cry of Yd Bahd'u'1-Abhd and Yd Ally-yu'l  Aid. 

 The vibration of the sound of that same soul-burning cry gradually noised abroad the call of this world-illuminating Great Announcement and the ringing notes of that call resounded in all regions of the world, and now too, the beloved friends in fran, who are the devoted dwellers in the courtyard of the Beloved, stand firm in the same Covenant and Testament. Behold the courage, firmness, detachment, unity, cooperation, zeal, and enthusiasm with which these loyal lovers of the Beloved daily face their tests and prove and demonstrate to the world, with radiant and shining faces, their purity, their heritage, their quality, and their virtue. 

 With the utmost meekness, truthfulness, wisdom, and courage they meet the challenges presented to them, the challenge of defying the enemies, dispelling misunderstandings which are a re-suit  of the proliferation of calumnies and false accusations. 

 They have met their fate with acquiescence, have bowed their heads in the valley of submission and resignation, and have borne every tribulation with radiance, for they know with absolute certainty that the fulfilment  of divine prophecies will coincide with dire events and the bearing of innumerable afflictions. 

The beloved Guardian       

 says: 'If in the days to come, adversities of various kinds should encircle that land and national upheavals  should further aggravate the present calamities, and intensify the repeated afflictions',  the dear friends in that country should not feel 'sorrowful and grieved' and must not be deflected 'from their straight path and chosen highway'. He then continues to address  the dear friends in these words: 'The liberation of this meek and innocent band of His followers from the fetters of its bondage and the talons of the people of tyranny and enmity must needs be preceded by the clamour and agitation of the masses. The realization of glory, of tranquillity, and of true security for the people of Baha will necessitate opposition, aggression and commotion  on the part of the people of malevolence  and iniquity. 

 Therefore, should the buffeting waves of the sea of tribulation intensify and the storms of trials and tribulations assail that meek congregation from all six sides, know of a certainty and without a moment's hesitation that the time for their deliverance has drawn nigh, that the age-old  promise of their assured glory will soon be fulfilled, and that at long last the means are provided for the persecuted people of Baha in that land to attain salvation and supreme triumph. A firm step and an unshakeable resolve are essential so that the remaining stages may come to pass and the cherished ideals of the people of Bah6 may be realized on the loftiest summits, and be made manifest in astounding brilliance. "Such is God's method, and no change shalt thou find in His method." 

  That is why those royal falcons who soar in the firmament of God's love have arisen with such joy, tranquillity, and dignity that their serenity has become a magnet for the attraction  of the confirmations of the Concourse on High and has brought such a resounding success to them as has astonished and startled the people of Baha throughout the world. Others have been inspired by the example of those treasured brethren to renew their pledge to their All-Glorious Beloved and to serve His Sacred Threshold with high endeavour.  Thus they endeavour, as far as possible, to make good the temporary disability of the believers in frhn. 

 Inspired by the courage, constancy, sincerity, and devotion of those enamoured friends in the path of their Beloved, they are increasing their services and renewing and strengthening their resolve so that they may arise in the arena of the love of God as it beseems tnie lovers. 

 That is why n these days the followers of the Greatest Name in different parts of the world have undertaken  to win new victories in remembrance and on behalf of their dear friends in tAn. They have made new plans and their efforts have been confirmed with resounding success, which they attribute to the influences of the high endeavours and the constancy of the friends in the Cradle of the Faith. 

 What then will you do, dear friends who come from that sacred land of Iran? You are the birds of that rosegarden. 

 You should sing such a song that the hearts of others will rejoice with gladness.


<p362>

  You are the candles of that Divine Sanctuary. You should shed such a light that it will illumine the eyes of the intimates of God's mysteries. Our eager hearts in these days are expectant to see the rays of loyalty and integrity from amidst these dark and threatening ing clouds, so that your blessed names, like those of your self-sacrificing compatriots, may be recorded in gold upon the Tablets of Honour. This is dependent upon your own high endeavour.

          13. THE EMERGENCE OF A UNIVERSAL
          MORAL ORDER AND THE PERSECUTION
          OF THE IRANIAN BAHA'I COMMUNITY

 WILL. C. VAN DEN HOONAARD  

                    INTRODUCTION

  ALL have been awestruck by recent events in Irdn which are reminiscent of the early days of the Baha Faith in that country during the nineteenth century. The ordeal of the Iranian Baha'i community leaves a powerful impression on both committed and uncommitted observers. 

 We are well-advised to weigh the minute elements of this tragic drama, as well as its fuller implications. 'Abdu'l-Baha, Son of the Prophet-Founder of the Faith, has repeatedly reminded the Baha'is of these implications: Therefore, 0 ye beloved of God, be not grieved when people stand against you, persecute you, afflict you and trouble you and say all manner of evil against you. The darkness will pass away and the light of the manifest signs will apear.' 

  The nature of persecution, whether religious  or political, has prompted scholars to consider one of four approaches.2 

 Martyrology  attempts to preserve and memorialize the tragic events ensuing from persecution.3 A second approach describes individual resistance,  whether active or passive, in the face of relentless oppression A The study of specific policies and the mechanism of oppression and destruction provides a third avenue.5

 e.g Douglas Martin, 'The Baha'is of jrgn Under the Pahiavi Regime, 1921 — 1979,' Middle East Focus, Vol. 4, no. 6 (March 1982, pp. 7 — 17. 

 these accounts help us to understand the fierce oppression and the human suffering and heroism we associate with the persecution of our religious brethren and sisters in IrAn. Thus, the significance of the Iranian persecution  is enshrined in the conquest of the spirit over the forces of materialism. 

 All these accounts inspire and demonstrate that the spiritual flame can be rekindled once again. Particularly, they reveal the depth of the individual's response to persecution. Baha'u'llah, referring to the early companions of the BTh, spoke of the same divine attributes which such souls manifest: All these stainless hearts and sanctified souls have, with absolute resignation, responded to the summons of His decree. Instead of complaining, they rendered thanks unto God, and amidst the darkness of their anguish they revealed naught but radiant acquiescence to His will The persecution and pain they inflicted on these holy and spiritual beings were regarded by them as means unto salvation, prosperity, and everlasting  success.6 

  The human face of the persecuted group constitutes the fourth view. This is the collective  dimension. 

 It is a socio~ogica1 fact that the real nature of social phenomena becomes more apparent at times of social conflict or stress. 

 Might this not be equally true when we consider the collective scope of the Baha'i response in frdn? 

 This social dimension is significant in that the persecutions bring to light the unique character of the Baha'i Faith and, in particular,  they have served to highlight the novel features of the Baha'i community, whose unity and modus operandi are enshrined in Baha scripture. 

 The persecutions have simply shown

364                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 the specific strengths of the Baha'i Order during such times when 'all manmade and essentially defective political institutions'1 fail or collapse. Those who examine the Faith of Baha'u'llah not only become aware that its Administrative Order is 'fundamentally different  from anything that any Prophet has previously established' ,2 but are encouraged to critically examine it: [The Faith] which the bewildered followers of bankrupt and broken creeds might well approach and critically examine, and seek, ere it is too late, the invulnerable security of its world-embracing shelter.3 

  The recent events in Iran attract the attention of these 'followers of bankrupt and broken creeds', as the events themselves attest to the unique character of the Baha'i community. 

 There is a fifth dimension which makes the persecutions of the Baha'is a significant phenomenon in our times. The impact of the persecutions has assumed an international scope and touches every member of the human family. This universal response to the events in Ir6n clearly indicates the emergence of an international conscience, presupposing an international moral order, linked to the emergence of the worldwide Baha'i community. 

 The purpose of this essay is to concentrate on the sociological significance of the persecutions  in IrAn, namely the way they highlight the unique aspects of the Baha'i community, and how they relate to a developing universal moral order. 
                          
       NOVEL FEATURES OF THE BAHA'I COMMUNITY

 The social significance of the persecuted Iranian Baha'i community leads us to ponder the cohesive force, the nature of leadership, the apolitical nature and the diversity and spread of that community. 

 These aspects stand out in sharp contrast to other types of human communities. 
                           
Social Cohesion            

 Independent observers have noted the social cohesiveness of the Iranian Baha'i community. Although suffering extensively under the burden  of oppression, it shows signs of intense vigour and spiritual devotion. 

 These signs are not only the outcome of an individualistic orientation but should be viewed as the result of a reorganization of its community life — the establishment of the distinctive nature of Baha'i communities. 

 The Baha'i community is already a historical reality which is able to sustain the transformation of the human personality. 

 Baha'is, therefore, link their own personal welfare with that of the Baha'i community as a whole. For example, Le Monde recbunts the story of a Mr. K~mr6n Samimi who had the opportunity of leaving lr~n, but refused to do so because of his moral

  3ibid., p. 54. 

 compulsion to stay to assist his fellow believers.4 

 That same report states that 'The Baha'is are not deprived of spiritual direction, even now'. 

 Another account, in the Globe and Mail,5 relates the story of a Dr. Far~marz Samandari, a practising medical doctor in Canada, who returned to fran to 'help his countrymen', knowing that he would be arrested and possibly executed, which, indeed, happened soon after his arrival in that country. Professor Marnichihr Hakim, a medical practitioner  and recipient of numerous awards for his discoveries in anatomy and founder of the Baha Hospital in Tihr~n, returned to Iran anticipating death (he was in fact shot in his clinic on 12 January 1981) but felt obliged to share in carrying the burdens of the Baha'i community. 

Other expatriate Baha'is   

 have returned to IrAn, despite the warnings of Amnesty  International.6 

 It is in such instances that the inspired personality can touch and change human history, driven by a purpose that seeks to fulfil the purpose of human unity. 

 Baha'i sources of information also indicate a general spiritual rededication of the Persian Baha'i community. One newspaper reported Le Monde, 1 January 1982. 

 Mr. $amimf was executed in Tihr6n on 27 December 1981. 

 31 July 1980. The story also appeared in Newsday,

 Baha'is, unmind-hi  of consequences, have courageously appealed by letter or cable to various high officials at national and local levels complaining  about barbaric acts, gross injustice, [and] revealed their names and addresses Too numerous are the heroic events which speak of the 'courage, steadfastness and unity which have suffused the Baha'i community in IrAn'.2 Such events are presently being recorded for the benefit of future generations of believers. 

 The spiritual elevation of such personal behaviour is also reflected by Baha'is who have been daily harassed by looters, as for instance the Baha'i families in Yazd who treat the looters as children who want to be satisfied with playthings.3 Other examples of this behaviour are found in the prisons, where Baha'is are known to have instituted programmes of benefit to the prison population as a whole, or have assisted prison guards with their personal or marital problems. 

 In areas where numbers of Baha'i refugees have gathered, they have established such cohesion that they have even refused offers of food from their persecutors.4 

 This imaginative resistance corresponds to the organized activities of the Baha'i communities  in I din. 

 For instance, the Baha community of Yazd established a

  2 A recent communication to all Canadian Baha'is from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of Canada. 

 'Excerpt from a letter from Yazd,' February 1982, published in Baha'i News (U.S.A.), No. 613, April 1q82, pp. 4 — 6, recounts several stories of this nature: 'When they [the Baha'is of Yazd] are looted of their property, furniture and belongings, they part with them as they would with outworn dolls and playthings They shower love upon those who come to take away their belongings as might an affectionate and indulgent parent who with a smile will give a worthless toy or plaything to a naughty child The Sun (San Bernardino, 

California), 19 January

 programme of education after the dismissal of over one hundred children from schools.5 In other reports, Baha'i communities are stated to have coordinated activities to alleviate pressures on afflicted believers by providing clothing, food, heating facilities and spiritual counselling. 

 The elected bodies of the communities  continue to meet, and their committees continue to function.6 

 The creative and cohesive response to persecution has its effects on the non-B ah&i society of fr6n. Attendance of a large number of people of all religious backgrounds is characteristic at funerals of slain Baha, and non-Bah6'i spouses of Baha'is have declared their faith in 

Baha'u'llah. The Baha    

 community  in Ir4n is responding dynamically and with spiritual 6lan to the methodical plan of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities to entirely uproot it. Leadership in the Baha'i 

Community                 

 One of the chief prongs of the present r6gime's strategy to undercut the Baha community reveals a lack of comprehension by the authorities of the distinctive system of governance of that community. Their strategy involves 'cutting off the head of the Baha'i community'. 

 This refers, presumably, to its 'leaders'. 

 Leadership in the Baha'i community is vested in elected bodies at local and national levels. Every year in April, Baha'i C0111-munities  elect from their membership nine adult believers who can serve on the governing body. The qualities required by members being considered for election are devotion, experience, loyalty and a well-trained mind. There is no electioneering or campaigning on one's own, or someone else's, behalf. Leadership  is, moreover, vested in this council as a whole, not in any one specific individual, or individuals, who are serving on it. No individual serving on the body has any powers extending beyond the confines of that body. The Spiritual Assembly renders decisions oniy when it is in session.

 administrative bodies ceased to function in obedience to the governmental order banning the Baha 

Administrative Order.     

 Such a ban constitutes, ironically, a formal recognition of Baha institutions.

366                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

     The Spiritual Assembly     

 is a divinely created institution whose members operate it according  to its laws. 

 Baha'u'llah writes: The Lord hat/i ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Baha [nine] 

 I Membership may change, but not the Spiritual Assembly as such. This principle has become clearly demonstrated in the Iranian experience. 

 In numerous instances arrested or executed members of the Local Assemblies or the National Assembly have been replaced by other members. This process frustrates all efforts by the authorities to do away with Baha'i 'leadership'. 
                           
The Apolitical Nature      

 of the Baha'i Communhy Both cursory observers and those who wish to examine more closely the workings of the Baha community in Jr~in will be impressed with the apolitical nature of that community, as indeed of the entire worldwide Baha community. One hundred and forty years of persecution, albeit in varying severity; have not moved the Baha'i community to partisan politics. 

 Efforts of previous r6gimes of fr6n to involve or implicate the Baha'i community in politics have been abysmal failures. 

 The Baha'i teachings are very clear on this point: the Guardian, through his secretary, has encouraged the Baha to 'shun politics like the plague'.2 The 

Universal House of Justice 

 has reiterated this principle of noninvolvement  in politics, drawing on the Writings of Baha'u'llah 

Himself.                   

 It is noteworthy that despite offered opportunities of gaining some political, shortterm advantage, the Baha'i community has not seized such opportunities. 

 The writings of the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, Shoghi Effendi, had forewarned the Baha'is of such enticements when they would become a large social force: As the number of the Baha'i communities in various parts of the world multiplies and 1  Universal House of Justice, A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, transi.

 their power, as a social force, becomes increasingly apparent, they will no doubt find themselves increasingly subjected to the pressure which men of authority and influence, in the political domain, will exercise in the hope of obtaining the support they require for the advancement of their aims.3 

  The single individual believer who permitted himself to become involved with politics, General Asadu'llAh Sanfi, was expelled from the Faith for that reason alone. To date, no charge of political involvement levelled against the Baha community by either present or previous authorities has ever been substantiated. 

 The continued existence of the Baha'i community in frAn cannot be explained in terms of the alleged power possessed by the Baha'is. 

 In this instance, the Baha'i community  is a sociological anomaly. 

 While most social analysts state that power, and political power in particular, is the basis of society, the continued existence of the Baha'i community offers proof that moral power is superior to political might. The establishment and evolution  of Baha'i communities follow the operation  of a divine law designed to reshape human society. According to 'Abdu'l-Baha, the laws of God are not impositions of will, or of power or pleasure, but the resolution of truth, reason and justice.4 

 The Baha'is under the r6gime of the Shdh did not possess power or influence, although a number of believers did occupy prominent scientific and administrative posts. It is equally true to say that the Baha'i community consists mainly of rural peoples who, as such, never enjoyed any 'privileges. 

  Diversity and Spread of the Baha'i Community This brings us to the diverse membership of the 

Baha'i community. It       

 is this diversity which has prevented its full-scale uprooting. Baha communities are found in all civil areas in the country. 
By April 1983 there were   

1,100 Spiritual Assemblies 

 in IrAn, incorporating all the diverse elements of the population as a

  whole, both tribal and religious. Representatives of close to two-thirds of all tribal minorities are found among the Baha. 

 The Baha'i community includes peoples of such diverse backgrounds as Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians and Muslims. 

 With so many elements of Iranian society represented in the Baha'i community there is neither one social nor ethnic background to serve as the focus of attack and the persecutors have been unable to touch a particular 'psyche' among the Baha'is, except that of divinely inspired sacrifice.  There are no predictable human reactions  to persecutions fostered by virtue of social or ethnic uniformity. 

 The Baha'i community is too diverse in character to resuft in a uniform human response. 

 In the Baha'i view, the diversity of the human group acts as a stabilizing element rather than a disruptive force, particifiarly when such variegated personalities and cultures  are under the influence of the revealed Word of God: The other kind [of difference] 

 which is a token of diversity is the essence of perfection and the cause of the appearance of the bestowals of the 

Most Glorious Lord.'      

  The spread of the Baha'i community has, by itself, frustrated the efforts of the persecutors. Them are 350,0% Baha'is in iran. Since furthermore, the ratio of Baha'i to non-B ah&i population is about 1:70, there is at least one Baha'i for every eleven or twelve households.2  Many non-BahA'f families are therefore acquainted with the manner in which Baha'is conduct themselves in their personal lives and in their professions and businesses. Today, as in the past, this lifestyle has aroused both emulation from the general population and envy from fanatical e1em~nts. 'Abdu'l-Baha often referred to such examples drawn froth the early days of the Faith. Speaking of an early believer who had espoused  the teachings of the Bab as a result of witnessing an episode of persecution, He said: When the clamor of the people rose high he hastened into the Street, and, becoming cognizant of the offence and the offender, 

1  'Abdu'l-Baha, Selections

 and the cause of his public disgrace and punishment in full detaiL he fell to making search, and that very day entered the society of the Bab's, saying, 'This very ill-usage and public humiliation is a proof of truth and the '3 very best of arguments Envy is a characteristic of fanatical groups — and also a part of the history of the persecution of the Faith in IrAn. 

 One is reminded of Baha'u'llah's statement recorded in the wellknown interview with Edward Granville 

Browne:                   

  We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; yet they deem Us a stirrer-up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment.4 

  Such personal knowledge of the Baha'is has prevented further destruction of the community.  The admiration and respect accorded by Muslims, Christians, 

Jews and Zoroastrians     

 — those who are personal friends of the Baha'is or those who have had business dealings with them — have in some cases mitigated  or offset the efforts of fanatical mobs and persecutors. 

 Muslim neighbours are known to have opened doorsand offered their homes to havenless Baha families, albeit furtively.5 This undercurrent of unofficial and informal sympathy has even become evident among some officials in the administrative hierarchy. In some instances they have opposed the measures levelled against the Baha'is at the risk of personal deposition or demotion. One headmaster of a school in Yazd decided to resign after receiving the order to dismiss his Baha pupils. He later absented himself from school. 

 The Baha'i community of Iran has existed for several generations, weaving the diversity of its membership into the fabric of Iranian society.

368              THE BAHA'I WORLD
  EMERGENCE OF A UNIVERSAL MORAL ORDER

 What are some of the other lessons to be learned from the persecutions and how can they apply to other countries? Civil, political, cultural and economic freedoms are often based on precarious sentiments and social consensus. 

 In many of the socalled 'enlightened'  countries these freedoms have been of too recent gain to occupy a secure foothold in the political and social structures of society. Fuller knowledge of the conditions of minorities who have been denied fundamental freedoms  indicates the precariousness of the humanitarian attitudes of governments. 

 There is also an empirical fact that the persecutors have naively ignored. 

 Never in the history of the Baha'i world community has world opinion in favour of the aims and teachings of the Baha Faith been more forcefully expressed than during the current wave of persecution in Iran. 

 The 'no-win~ situation which presents itself to the persecutors  must bring little comfort to those responsible  for the oppression. This condition illustrates  the point made by 'Abdu'l-Baha: they [i.e., oppressors] 

 thought that violence and interference would cause extinction  and silence and lead to suppression and oblivion; whereas interference in matters of conscience causes stability and firmness and attracts the attention of men's sight and souls; which fact has received experimental proof many times and often •~ What attracts the attention of all humanity are the unique features of the Baha community  and its positive approach to the emergence  of a new universal moral order. It is a striking fact that conditions of home and state have only in recent times become a matter of universal concern. 

 While until recently any matter that affected the wellbeing of a country was considered the exclusive concern of the secular or religious authorities in that country, the welfare of every nation, community, group or family has today become of universal concern. 

 The walls that served to both protect those who violated human rights and to hinder the development of human so-'Abdu'1-Bah6, 

'Abdu'l-Baha, A Traveler's 
Narrative, p. 6.           
ciety have fallen away.    

 While human policies were previously guided by limited national interests, they are today increasingly matters of international concern. The patchwork of these human policies has given way to a universal pattern of human rights and obligations.  We are now witnessing the decline of inadequate human standards and the emergence  of a new universal moral order. 

 The trials of the Baha'i community in Iran are a major contributing factor to the creation of that moral order. In a sense, the emergence of the Iranian Baha community coincides with the emergence of that moral order. The two are inseparably linked together. 

 We should perhaps examine how 'this twofold process works. 

 This process is a dialectical one. The emergence of the Baha'i community from obscurity is partially possible through the existence of the growing universal consciousness.  Universal declarations and covenants dealing with the dignity ~f the human person and social groups are steadily being established.  While it is true that nations may choose to accept or ignore such international standards of human rights and obligations, according to their own political advantage, the fact remains that universal standards are being developed and established. New nations and the international media, to name but two examples, often derive their sense of justice and universal morality from the provisions in these international codes. 

 The persecutions of the Baha are thus an affront to every citizen of global outlook who has become immersed in this universal, moral consciousness. An attack on a Baha'i in even the most remote place by the most ignorant of men does not go unnoticed. The Baha'is become yet another focus of our universal moral conscience. The more severe the persecutions,  the louder will be the outcry of humanity as a whole. 

 This outcry is also the means by which universal, moral sentiments become crystallized and clearer. This outcry also contributes to the emergence of the Baha'i community from obscurity. The two processes are interlinked and mutually supporting.

    14. PERSECUTION OF THE BAHA'I FAITH IN IRAN:
        A PARTIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF REFERENCES
         FROM BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS, JOURNALS,

           NEWSPAPER ARTICLES AND OFFICIAL
        DOCUMENTS IN SOME EUROPEAN LANGUAGES

 COMPILED BY WILLIAM P. COLLINS,  

       WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF JANET H. BEAVERS

 THIS bibliography attempts to bring together  a representative sampling of works published by non-Babil'f agencies, in western languages, that make reference to the persecution  of the Baha community in kin during the period Ridvan 1979 to Ridvan 1983. The bibliographer makes no claim that the bibliography is exhaustive, the entries being taken exclusively from the collections of materials held in the 

Baha'i World Centre Library.

 In the case of books, pamphlets and journal articles an attempt was made to be thorough, and the entries reflect both those materials with significant references to the persecutions, and those which include passing mention in a larger context. In the case of newspaper articles, sheer volume forced the compiler to rely upon selection of the most important articles from a number of countries. 

 In a number of cases the Baha'i community of Iran is treated in works which deal with political issues in I ran. It should be noted that the Baha'i Faith is not a political tovement, as clearly stated in other sections of this volume of The Baha'i World. There are also sections 1.1.1. 

 and 2.1.1. listing items in English which speak of the Baha'is from the point of view of the governing authorities of the Islamic Republic of I r6n. The reader will understand that the Baha'is categorically deny the charges and accusations made against them by these authorities. 

 The entries are arranged in broad categories by type of publication, and sub-arranged by language. 

 Within language categories, the entries are alphabetical by the entry — by author or, in the absence of an author, by title. Newspaper articles are arranged by country, then alphabetically by the entry. Occasionally entries have no indication of page number(s) on which the reference to the 

Baha Faith appears. This  

 occurs either because the bibliographical item itself has no paging, or because the compilers have seen an incomplete copy. Apologies are made for this inadequacy, which it is hoped will be remedied as time permits.

380                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

           15. A CHRONOLOGY OF SOME OF THE
        PERSECUTIONS OF THE Bab's AND BAHA'IS
                       IN IRAN
                      1844 — 1978

            COMPrLED BY DR. MOOJAN MOMEN

  I N many cases, the year of an event is given in the sources only as a year of the Hijri (Muslim) calendar. The start of the Hijri year, which is thirteen days shorter than the solar year, rotates through the solar year and thus any particular Hijri year overlaps two solar years. In the following list, where only a Hijri date is given in the sources the event has been listed under the first of the two Gregorian years that that Hijri year covers unless the start of the Hijri year falls in November or December, in which case the event is listed under the following year. Similarly, the Baha year, which begins on the vernal equinox, overlaps two Gregorian years. Those events for which only the Baha year is given are shown in the following list as occurring in the first of the two Gregorian years that that year overlaps. In these cases the relevant year is given in parentheses after the Gregorian year together with the following abbreviations: A.H.Q. — Lunar Hijri year; B.E. — Badi' (Baha) year. 

 Unfortunately, in a work of this nature, it is not possible to give a detailed note of the source of information used for each episode. In compiling this chronology of the persecutions of the BThI and Baha'i Faiths in fr6n from their inception in 1844 until the start of the current persecutions in 1978, a wide variety of sources has been used, from English works such as Nabil's Narrative and volumes of The Baha'i World to printed Persian woiks such as Lshr6q-Khavarf's s Taqvtm-i-Tdr[kh-i-Amr  and Hdi1-i-M4zandar~ni's Zuhdru'l-Haqq. Also manuscript materials have been used, especially a series of histories of the Baha'i Faith in different localities in Irdn that were compiled by various authors particularly in the 1920s and 1930s under the instructions of Shoghi Effendi. 

 This listing must be regarded as provisional since further research will undoubtedly uncover other episodes of persecution not listed here. 

1845: 23 June; Shfrrtz:    

 Arrest, beating and expulsion from Shirdz of Quddiis, MulTA SAdiq-i-KhurAs~ni,

 as an international nongovernmental organization  under the name 'Baha International Community.' 

 An official Baha'i — U.N. relationship  had actually started a year before — in the spring of 1947 — when OPI accredited the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of the United States and Canada as a national nongovernmental organization, qualified to be represented through an observer. 

 The next step in Baha'i — U.N. cooperation — and a major one — took place in 1970, when the Baha 

International Community   

 was granted consultative status, category H, with the 

United Nations Economic   
and Social Council (ECOSOC).

 A few years later, in 1974, as an extension of this relationship in the economic and social fields, the 

Baha International Commhnity

 established an association with the United Nations 

Environment  Programme   

 (UNEP). Then, in 1976 —  another important development — it was weT-corned  into consultative status with the United Nations 

Children's Fund (UNICEF). 
                          
The First Period: 1947 — 1970

 Although limited to activities educating the public about the aims and programs of the United Nations, the first stage of Baha'i — U.N. cooperation allowed many opportunities for sharing the Baha'i perspective, both through participation in numerous nongovernmental conferences, and through the presentation to the U.N. of several important statements. 

 One of the most important contributions took place in 1947, when the United 

Nations                   

  For detailed information on Baha'i International Community activities with the U.N. during this period, see earlier volumes of The 

Baha'i World.             
Special Palestine Committee
addressed a letter  to   

His Eminence Shoghi Effendi

 Rabbani head of the Baha'i Faith, resident at the Baha'i World Centre in Haifa, requesting an expression of the Baha'i attitude to the future of Palestine. 

 Explaining that 'Our aim is the establishment of universal peace in the world and our desire to see justice prevail in every domain of human society, including the domain  of politics,' Shoghi Effendi enclosed with his reply a summary of the history and teachings of the Baha'i Faith. 

 Other presentations of note were: A 'Baha'i Declaration on Human Obligations and Rights' (1947); a study entitled 'Proposals for Charter Revision,' circulated at a U.N. 

Conference for Revision   

 of the U.N. Charter (1955); a statement  endorsing the Genocide Convention, presented to the President of the 

Commission on Human Rights

 (1959); and a comprehensive statement to a meeting of the United Nations 

Office of Public Information

 to discuss  problems of cooperation 'with the United Nations family insofar as its programme affects the new nations', noting the 'vigorous assistance of Baha communities' through the implementation of Baha teachings and principles,  to help the less developed peoples become integrated into the more developed society surrounding them (1960). 

      The Baha'i International  

 Community was also able, even in the early years of its relationship with the U.N., to assist in the protection and recognition of the Baha'i world community. 

 Such were the cases of Baha'i persecutions in Iran and Morocco, in 1955 and 1962, respectively, when appeals were lodged with the United Nations, and in 1967, the presentation, on behalf of the Universal House of Justice, of a special edition of the Proclamation of Baha'u'llah to fifty-six Heads of States, through the good offices of their Permanent Representatives to the 

United Nations.

394                 THE BAHA'! WORLD
The Second Period: 1970 — 1979

 These years witnessed a noticeable increase in the range and depth of Baha'i — U.N. cooperation, as the Baha'i International Community  began the steady growth of its consultative relationship with ECOSOC and with UNICEF, and its association with UNEP; while continuing its close cooperation with the U.N. 

Office of Public Information
(OPI) —  which became the    

Department of Public Information
(DPI) on 1 January 1979.   

 As it worked closely with ECOSOC, its functional commissions, committees and associated  bodies, the Baha'i International Community gradually explored new avenues of participation in United Nations social and economic programs. 

 Not only was it represented at sessions of U.N. bodies concerned with issues of human rights, social development, status of women, environment, human settlements,  world food, science and technology, population, law of the sea, crime prevention, narcotic drugs, children, youth, the family, the United Nations University, and disarmament, but it also furnished information, submitted statements and published brochures on most of these subjects. In addition the Baha'i International Community participated in United Nations Years, in world conferences and congresses, in regional conferences and in seminars concerned with the socioeconomic problems of our planet, as well as in preparation  and followup meetings and activities. 

 When the Committee on NonGovernmental Organizations, the functional committee of ECOSOC in charge of fostering the U.N. relationship with NGO's in the social and economic field, reviewed at its 1978 session the work of nongovernmental organizations in consultative status with ECOSOC during the years 1973 — 1977, the Baha 

International Community    

 report, showing an impressive roster of activities recording warm cooperation with the U.N., was approved without questions. 

 Most gratifying during this period was the increased awareness and participation of national Baha communities through their National Spiritual Assemblies, U.N. representatives and committees, in fostering the ties of the Baha'i world with the United Nations. They not only organized national and local Baha'i — U.N. activities, but also provided knowledgeable Baha to help both in preparing  statements and pamphlets examining the application of Baha'i teachings and principles to the solution of specific world issues, and in representing the Baha International Community at conferences. In addition, the involvement of National Spiritual Assemblies in countries where U.N. conferences or meetings took place, through furnishing valuable services to ensure a more effective Baha'i participation, created an awareness of how each Baha community did, in fact, share in the 

Baha'i International       

 Community's consultative relationship with ECOSOC and 

UNICEF.                    
    The Baha'i International   

 Community also worked closely, through its U.N. representatives, with U.N. offices and officials at U.N. headquarters in New York, as well as in Geneva and Nairobi; and, through representatives from its member Baha'i communities, with U.N. field offices around the world. 

 In addition, under the direction and guidance of the Universal House of Justice, contacts were made on many occasions during this period with the United Nations Missions and Secretariat. Here again a growing understanding of the nonpolitical and constructive nature of the Baha'i International Community in the work of the U.N., aided by its consultative status, made access to key United Nations officials easier when a clear presentation of the Baha'i position was needed to foster the official recognition of the Faith, or to prevent discrimination against the Baha community. 

 During these years it became clear that, as government delegates and United Nations personnel increasingly witnessed the Baha'i presence, through extensive Baha'i representation  and a variety of Baha'i statements (almost always circulated as U.N. documents), they were becoming aware of the existence not oniy of a worldwide Baha'i community, but also of a Baha'i view resting on a new spiritual and moral foundation essential for an effective and permanent solution to world problems and the building of a world civilization.

       2. THE BAHA'! INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
               AND THE UNITED NATIONS
                     1979 — 1983

                  VICTOR DE ARAUJO

  THE period 1979 — 1983 witnessed considerable  growth of 

Baha'i International       

 Community  activities with the United Nations. Besides expanding its cooperation with the U.N. in the many areas of earlier involvement related to programs implementing the goals of the U.N. Charter — peace, human rights, and development1 — the Baha'i 

International Community    

 was able to offer the Baha'i perspective and cooperation in new areas of U.N. concern — disabled persons, the aging, new and renewable sources of energy — as well as to begin its contribution to an issue long considered important by the U.N. — the exploration  and peaceful uses of outer space. 

 The responsibilities of the Baha'i International Community for the protection of the Faith, prominent on a few occasions in the past, were greatly expanded during this period to allow, under instructions from the Universal House of Justice, for the coordination of worldwide activities, at international and national levels, on behalf of the beleaguered Baha'i friends in I r~n.2 

 In 1981 the Baha'i International

 Community was asked to submit a report of its activities in fulfillment oUts consultative relationship with the Economic and Social Council, covering the years 1977 to 1981, for examination by the U.N. 

Committee on NonGovernmental Organizations
at its 1982 session.       

 This second quadrennial report prepared by the Baha'i International Community, since receiving consultative status with ECOSOC in 1970, again showed extensive cooperation and, like the previous one (1973 — 1977), received full approval. 

    The Baha International    

 Community office in New York increased gradually both its space and personnel, and by Ridvan of 1983

International Community    
activi-, ties for 1947 — 1979.

International Community    

 in assisting the friends in Iran can be found on p. 337. 

 the office comprised some 2,000 square feet with a staff of nine full-time persons, and several volunteers. 

 This expansion was in part the result of the escalation of the persecutions in fran, and led soon to a logical concentration of all Baha'i International Community human rights activities in one specific section, headed by Mr. Gerald Knight, who had joined the Baha'i International Community office in New York in 1979 as Alternate Representative.  Mr. Knight, then serving as Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Fiji Islands, replaced Dr. Will. C. van den Hoon-aard,  who resigned to pursue a career in university teaching. 

 Dr. van den Hoonaard had served as Alternate Representative with much enthusiasm and dedication since 1975. 
     In 1981 the range of Baha'i

International Community    

 operations in Geneva was expanded  through the establishment of a European  Branch Office to assist in the Baha activities with the U.N. in Geneva and Vienna, as well as to establish a closer relationship with European national Baha'i communities and with some regional bodies such as the Council of Europe and the European Parliament.  Mr. Giovanni Baha'u'llah, Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of Italy, was appointed to head this office and represent the Baha'i International Community with the U.N. in Geneva. Dr. Marco Kappenberger who had served in that capacity since 1972, but whose present professional responsibilities prevented him from devoting the time and energy which he had so generously given in the past, continued to assist as Alternate Representative until the end of 1981, along with Mine. Machid Fatlo, then Alternate Representative. 

 Mine. Fatlo is now working full-time as Alternate Representative for the European Branch Office and the U.N. in Geneva. 

       When in September 1979     

 the United Nations moved its Centre for Social and Humanitarian Affairs to Vienna, it became necessary for the


<p397>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I' f ACTIVITIES                              397

Baha International Community

 to appoint representatives to the Vienna International Centre (VIC) — the new U.N. branch headquarters  — since important areas of social and humanitarian activity, such as the advancement  of women, crime prevention, curbing of drug abuse, as well as issues related to the aging, youth, disabled persons, were now centered in Vienna. Accordingly, Mr. Gerhard Schweter and Mr. Kent Beveridge, members of the National Spiritual Assembly of Austria, were appointed Baha International Community  representatives, and served most ably and enthusiastically in that capacity from early 1980 to early 1982, when both had to resign because of demanding professional and elected  Baha'i responsibilities. 
Since then, Mr. Roland     

Philipp and Mrs. Otti      

 KMer have been responsible, as Representative and Alternate respectively, for the Baha'i International Community  participation in activities taking place at the Vienna International 

Centre.                    

 Rich opportunities for the Baha'i International Community to contribute towards the constructive work of the United Nations in building a world in which justice and peace will prevail continued to surface during this period, in almost all areas of human needs and concerns, and the Baha'i cooperation was increasingly welcomed by the United Nations. 
                           
NEW AREAS OF COOPERA HON   
                           
Aging                      

 As it began considering issues affecting the wellbeing of the 'aging' — persons over sixty years old — the United Nations decided to convene, in 1982, a World Assembly on the Aging, to explore the problem fully, and created an Advisory Committee to plan for the conference and to draft a Plan of Action for approval and implementation by all governments.  The Baha'i International Community showed warm interest in the issue by taking part in these preparatory U.N. activities, and later in the World Assembly itself. 

  The Baha'i International   

 Community also joined in the efforts of the NGO Committee on the Aging to encourage the contribution of nongovernmental organizations to the World Assembly deliberations, and served during 1981 and 1982 on the Committee's Executive Board. 

 In addition, it sent representatives to a NGO Forum on Aging, which met in Vienna a few months before the Assembly, to exchange the views and knowledge of NGO's, so that these might be channeled through a comprehensive report to the World Assembly. Two Baha'i recommendations, offered to the organizers of the Forum when the agenda of the meeting was being planned, were repeated during the Forum: (1) that there must be full integration of the aging in the human community, since the community should be an extended family in which everyone, of any age, is an essential part, and not oniy allowed, but encouraged, to make the fullest possible contribution to the wellbeing of the whole; and (2) that in considering the needs of the aging in the process of development we must take into account the wholeness of the human being — moral and spiritual dimension, besides his emotional, intellectual, and physical nature — when discussing the special contributions of older persons to development and their sharing in the resulting benefits. 

 At the World Assembly, an oral statement by the 

Baha International Community

 representative  also stressed the Baha'i view. It expressed the hope that the Assembly would in its concern for the aging 'create a momentum for a better understanding of the reality of the human being in its various aspects.' The Baha'i perspective was conveyed even more fully in one of the parallel NGO meetings addressed specifically to the 'Spiritual Needs of the Aging.' 
                           
Disabled Persons           

 In its growing concern with the plight of persons suffering from a wide range of disabilities, the United Nations proclaimed 1981, International Year of 

Disabled Persons. The      
Baha'i International       

 Community expressed  its cooperation through participation in a U.N. Advisory Committee whose main task was to prepare a program of action to improve the conditions of the disabled, for implementation by world governments with the assistance of nongovernmental institutions  and organizations. 

 A number of Baha'i communities around the world also undertook programs for the disabled during IYDP. 

 At present, a Decade of Disabled Persons (1983 —  1992), proclaimed by the U.N. General Assembly,  provides the Baha International


<p398>
398                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Community and its member communities worldwide with further opportunities for cooperation. 

     The Baha'i International    

 Community also contributed during this period to the drafting of a brochure on 'The DisaNed Child,' published  by the NGO Committee on UNICEF, outlining UNICEF's approach to disability and the role that NGO's could play in preventing  and treating disabilities in children. It also worked closely with other NGO's in a UNICEF/NGO Committee on the Disabled Child, which cosponsored a symposium on 'Childhood Disabilities: Inevitable or Preventable,' as a contribution to JYDP. 
                           
Energy — New and Renewable   
Sources                    
 In August 1981 the United  
Nations called a Conference

 on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, in Nairobi, Kenya, to identify broad guidelines for short and long-term solutions to the divers needs and problems of energy and to develop an appropriate plan of action. This U.N. Conference had been preceded in March of that year by a conference of nongovernmental organizations — 'Energy 2000' — held in Tunis, Tunisia. The 

Baha'i International Community
participated in both Conferences.

  In Nairobi, the Baha'i     
International Community   

 delegation took part both in the Conference and in a parallel NGO Forum. 

 A brief statement circulated to the Conference, remarked that 'the integration of life on the planet requires unified action on a scale we have not yet achieved,' since until 'there is unity at the most fundamental level — that of human values — social problems, simple or complex, will remain unresolved.' 

 The statement  further stressed that 'the worldwide nature of the problem in energy and in similar environmental issues requires a universal spiritual solution,' and concluded by observing  that we must be cognizant 'of the tremendous power of spiritual energy which will be released when the oneness of mankind is realized and the limitless potential that will be available to us for effecting lasting change for the betterment of all mankind.' This is a goal for which Baha'is are striving and towards which humanity itself is moving. 
    Participation by the Baha 

International Community    

 delegation in the Conference and in the parallel NGO Forum also included assistance in preparing a Kenya NGO exhibit and giving interviews on behalf of the Kenya NGO group; keynoting a panel for the NGO Forum on education, training and awareness in relation to energy issues, as well as participation in other NGO workshops; newspaper, radio and TV interviews featuring the 

Baha'i International Community

 participation in the Conference; and wide distribution of the brochure, 'The Environment and Human Values — A Baha'i 

View.'                     
   The following year the     

Baha'i International Community

 was represented at a meeting of an Interim Committee on New and Renewable  Sources of Energy, in Rome, called to launch the implementation of the Programme of Action, approved at the Nairobi Conference,  for the development and utilization of new and renewable sources of energy. In 1983, the 

Baha'i International Community

 cohtin-ued  its involvement in this issue, by attending the first session of the Intergovernmental Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, meeting in New York; and it will continue to seek opportunities for cooperation  on this issue. 
                           
Exploration and Peaceful   
Uses of Outer Space        

 For many years the United Nations has been aware of the potential of outer space exploration in the social and economic development of the planet, but has been concerned  at the same time with the grave danger of the use of outer space by technologically advanced nations for military purposes. 

 To discuss these issues at the highest level the U.N. held the UNISPACE '82 Conference in Vienna, in August of 1982. In participating for the first time in discussions on this subject, the Baha 

International Community    

 submitted to the Conference a written statement, officially circulated, and further called attention to its views in an oral presentation. The key point made in those statements was that, if we are to prepare ourselves to utilize the promising new technology that has permitted travel and exploration in outer space, we must recognize the truth stated by Baha'u'llah more than a century ago that 'the earth is but one country and mankind its citizens,' and must work together 'to foster and promote world minded-ness like never before in the planet's history.'

  Ultimately, the unity of the human race, the statement concluded, quoting from the Baha Writings, implied 'the establishment of a world commonwealth,' a stage of international development requiring 'no less than the reconstruction  and demilitarization of the whole civilized world — a world organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life.'

  The International Year     

 of the Child (IYC) was enthusiastically supported by the Baha'i International Community — ninety-four national communities participated — as evidenced by a widely distributed report on Baha'i activities around the world. This report included information on a series of Baha'i ongoing programs in child education, teacher training, preparation  of child education materials, publications for and concerning children, and women's activities;  besides describing the specific Baha'i promotion of IYC through organizing and planning programs, publicity campaigns, exhibitions  and displays, parades and festivals, radio, television and press publicity, and public events. There was much publicity also through Baha'i media. In contrast to those activities generally aimed at and involving the adult public, many programs were specifically child directed: children's festivals, parties, entertainment; children's conferences; and children's art and music. 

 This IYC report — included in a special IYC edition of Baha'i News (U.S.A.), July 1980 —  was sent to 

Mrs. Estefania Aldaba      
Lim, U.N. Special Representative,

Assistant Secretary General

 for JYC, and shared with a number of U.N. and UNICEF officials andpersonnel. 

 In a letter of thanks, Mrs. Lim wrote that reading this issue of Baha'i News cover to cover had given her 'such a great feeling of comfort, elation and towering sense of pride' in the achievements of the Baha'i International Community during JYC. She continued: 'I cannot express my feelings of gratitude in more adequate ways to your organization for the all-out cooperation and support which you as an NGO extended to our IYC Secretariat and above all to the children of the world for the promotion of their welfare and development.' 

 ment.' Mrs. Lim concluded her letter by saying: 'I pray and hope that the Year 1979 (JYC) was just a beginning of Baha'is' deep commitment for the child's causes and that your widespread advocacy will now begin to bear fruit on behalf of the child.' 

   The Baha International    

 Community continued  to take part in the annual sessions of the UNICEF Executive Board — in 1979 in Mexico City, preceded by a special meeting on the situation and development of children in Latin America and the Caribbean; and in 1980, 1981 and 1982 in New York. The Spanish and English versions of the May 1979 NGO/UNJCEF Newsletter, containing a report  on the efforts of Baha communities in Latin America and the Caribbean to increase awareness of UNICEF programs in those areas, were circulafed at the Mexico City meetings. 

 During this entire peripd the Baha'i International Community was represented on the Steering Committee of the Non-Governmen-tal 

Organizations Committee    

 on UNICEF. Mrs. Mary Sawicki sewed as Secretary from 1979 to 1981; later Dr. Victor de Araujo was elected Chairman of the NGO Committee on UNICEF, and has been serving in that capacity since October 1981. Mrs. Sawicki served also for several years as Assistant Editor of the NGO/UNICEF Newsletter, and Dr. de Araujo is presently on the Editorial Board of the NGO Forum, the official NGO publication that has succeeded the Newsletter. 

 Their contribution has been welcomed by NGO's and the UNICEF Secretariat, and has further strengthened the Baha International Community relationship with 

UNICEF.                    

 In addition, besides serving during IYC on the IYC/NGO Committee, and participating in numerous committees and special meetings in observance Qf that Year, the Baha'i 

International  Community  

 took part in activities concerning the disabled child, breast feeding and infant feeding — Baha'i representatives helped to organize and chair the 1981 NGOI UNICEF symposia on 'The Disabled Child' and on 'Breast Feeding' — as well as NGOI UNICEF field level relations, and assistance to children in emergency situations. 

 As UNICEF became increasingly aware of the extent of Baha'i activities on behalf of

  children and women — such as the work of Dr. Jane 

Faily, Baha'i International

 Community LYC consultant for Africa, in West Africa (reported in the NGO/UNLCEF Newsletter), as well as the operations of the Baha'i schools in India and the radio stations in Ecuador and Peru — it became clear that there would be opportunities, in the near future, for field level cooperation with UNICEF. 
                           
Crime Prevention           
   During this period, the    

Baha'i International Community
took part in the Sixth     

United Nations Congress    

 on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held in 

1980 in Caracas~ Venezuela.

 A Baha'i statement bearing on the issue of 'Crime 

Trends and Crime Prevention

 Strategies,' circulated as a Congress document, offered the view that 'both the causes of crime and the means of its prevention are inextricably linked to the question of personal moral values'; and that although punishment for crime is one of the means 'by which society can and must, if necessary protect itself against oppressors, it is nevertheless possible to educate human beings so effectively in moral virtues that ''crime itself will appear to them as the greatest chastisement, the utmost condemnation and torment".' The statement further quoted from the Baha Writings that religion is a 'mighty bulwark' preventing 'both the manifest and the concealed crime and is the all-inclusive power which guarantees the felicity of the world of mankind.' 

    The Baha'i International   

 Community also continued to cooperate with the Branch on Crime prevention and Criminal Justice, in the U.N. Centre for Social and Humanitarian Affairs, in Vienna, and to attend the biennial sessions of the Committee on Crime 

Prevention  and Control.  

 At the 1982 session of the Committee, the Baha'i 

International Community   

 representative made a statement on 'Summary or Arbitrary Executions,' providing documentation from the recent Baha'i experience  in fran — without identifying the country — as an objective contribution to the discussion on the issue. 

  Development — Social and 

Economic                   

 Besides continuing its participation in the two main yearly sessions of the Economic and 

Social Council, in New     

 York and Geneva respectively, as well as in the biennial sessions of the Commission for Social Development, the 

Baha International Community

 found several other opportunities during this period to indicate its deep interest in promoting the social and economic development of all peoples, by attending the 1981 United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, in Paris, as well as by participating in meetings of the High-Level Committee on the Review of Technical 

Cooperation among Developing

 Countries held in Geneva and New York. It also followed closely the 11th Special Session of the General Assembly on the New International Economic Order, and participated in the NGO Forum, 'Agenda for the Eighties.' 

     The Baha International    

 Community also frequenfly took part in discussions of U.N. bodies seeking avenues of closer cooperation with nongovernmental organizations, in rural and urban development programs — such as the United 

Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

 and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNJCEF) — for the time when the growth of Baha'i communities would make it possible to begin field projects in cooperation with the 

United Nations.            
                           
Disarmament                

 In addressing the U.N. General Assembly, as a nongovernmental organization invited to make a contribution to the deliberations of the 1982 Second Special 

Session on Disarmament    
(SSD2), the Baha'i International

 Community  took a further step in its cooperation with the U.N. in the work of that world organization to achieve general and complete disarmament. 

 In observing that the 'inability of human power alone to solve the affairs of humanity,' had been amply demonstrated by the history of this century, and that a 'reawakened realization of our connection with God' had become, therefore, essential, the statement offered two main recommendations: (1)  establishment of a program of education for all peoples in the vital principle and truth of the organic oneness of humanity, drawing on all knowledge, whether from science or religion; and (2) achievement of collective security, based on trust and justice, through the efforts of governments and peoples — a

  security that would provide for lasting world peace, 'and make obsolete once and for all the arms arsenals and the reasoning behind them.' 

     The Baha'i International   

 Community also circulated during SSD2 a cover-updated version  of 'The Promise of Disarmament and Peace,' a statement prepared for the 1978 General Assembly session on Disarmament. This brochure was mailed with the oral statement  later that year, during Disarmament Week — a yearly event beginning on U.N. Day, 24 October — to U.N. delegations and to important members of the U.N. Secretariat. Copies were also sent to Baha communities around the world, with a letter encouraging Baha participation in Disarmament Week and in a World Disarmament Campaign launched by the 

United Nations.            

 Both before and after SSD2, the Baha'i International Community continued its cooperation  with the U.N. 

Department for Disarmament 

 Affairs, as well as its participation  in the work of the NGO Committees on 

Disarmament in New York    

 and Geneva, and in NGO conferences and meetings organized  by those Committees.

Baha'i International Community

 with the United Nations in the area of the environment, dating from the 1972 World Conference on the Human Environment,  in Stockholm, Sweden, continued steadily during this period through attendance at the yearly sessions of the Governing Coun-cii  of the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP), in Nairobi, and through membership and participation in the activities of the Environment Liaison Centre, a non-govern-mental group concerned with environmental issues. 

The Baha'i International   

 Community also took part in the Special Session of UNEP commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the Stockholm 

Conference.                

 Further, Baha'i communities expressed their concern for a better quality of life on this planet through activities in observance of World Environment Day, 5 June. In Kenya, for instance, educational programs and special projects for the occasion, to assist UNEP and government programs in the environment field, such as in tree-planting, water and sanitation, and soil erosion, involving village chiefs, school principals, and other local officials and prominent persons, were most successful. 
                           
Food                       
     The Baha'i International   

 Community continued  to follow with much interest United Nations efforts to resolve the serious world food problem. In this regard it worked closely with the NGO Working Group on Food and Rural Development, most recently in the preparations being made for participation of nongovernmental organizations in the Ninth Annual Ministerial Session of the World Food Council, to take place in New York, in June 1983, and in the parallel NGO Food Policy Forum planned for that occasion. 
                           
Health                     
    The Baha'i International   

 Community pursued  its concern for primary health care by keeping in touch with the offices of UNICEF and WHO in New York, and, towards the end of this period, foresaw rich opportunities for cooperation when UNICEF launched a four-pronged children's health revolution — oral rehydration therapy, immunization, breast feeding and proper weaning, and home growth charts—  intended to speed up the goal of 'Health for All by the Year 2000,' set up by the WHO/UNICEF Alma Ata Conference in 1978. 

 It also expressed its interest in the International 

Drinking Water Supply      

 and Sanitation Decade (1981 — 1990), a decade to achieve clean water and sanitation for all by the year 1990, and sought ways to gradually inform Baha'i communities about this area of U.N. activity, for possible cooperation. 

 In the field of mental health, the Baha'i International Community was most capably represented at the 1979 and 1981 World Congresses on Mental Health, held respectively  in Salzburg, Austria and Manila, Philippines, prestigious meetings sponsored by a nongovernmental organization, the World Federation for Mental Health. The Salzburg Congress, especially, offered an excellent opportunity to disseminate the Baha point of view, when almost 600 copies of 'The Violence Free Society: A Gift for Our Children,'  a monograph published by the Association for Baha'i Studies (ABS), were distributed  to participating professionals.


<p402>
402                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The work of WHO and UNICEF in the field of health was also brought to the attention of Baha'i health professionals at the 1980 Conference on ~Hea1th and Healing,' sponsored by the Association for Bab6'i Studies in Ottawa, Canada, when the Baha'i International Community representative delivered  a paper entitled 

'Health: A Global Perspective.'

 After the Ottawa Conference led to the establishment in 1982 of a Baha'i International 

Health Agency,1 the Baha'i International

 Community sought to develop a close relationship with that institution, with the aim of broadening and deepening Baha'i participation in U.N. health programs and activities. 
                          
Human Rights              

 Besides its extensive role in seeking assistance from the United Nations to redress the flagrant violation of human rights experienced by the Baha'i community in fr6n — a human rights activity documented fully in another section of the present edition of 

Baha'i World2 — the Baha'i  

 International Community widened the scope of its cooperation in implementing the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as elaborated and codified in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International  Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Not only did it continue its longtime assistance to U.N. efforts in corn-batting racism and racial discrimination, but contributed the Baha'i views on the drafting of a Declaration on the 

Elimination of All Forms  

 of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief (and after the adoption of this Declaration in 1981, on implementing the principles of the Declaration); on the drafting of a Convention on the Rights of the Child; on the elaboration of a Declaration on the Right to Development; and on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous populations. 

 A number of written and oral statements submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and the SubCommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, at their yearly sessions, as well as information provided to the Division of Human Rights — now Centre See p. 201. 
2 See p. 414.             

 for Human Rights — in reply to requests for Baha views and assistance, conveyed the Baha principles and teachings, and offered specific suggestions for action in those human rights areas. 

 For the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Baha'i International Community was able to offer the text of two articles, one on the role of the mass media in disseminating information of benefit to the health and welfare  and the social and cultural development of the child, and the other on the appropriate guidance, training and education to which the child should be entitled for his social, spiritual,  and moral development and wellbeing. These proposals were submitted to the January  1983 session of the Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights charged with the drafting process. In addition a statement was circulated to the 1983 session of the Commission on Human Rights stressing the importance of the acquisition and exercise of spiritual qualities, which 'must be taught, fostered and developed,' and will best take root 'if they are taught from earliest childhood.'  It was essential in the Baha'i view, that every child receive spiritual education, and that the Convention contain provisions specifically  designed to promote this purpose. Such provisions would not only enable the child to realize his full human potential but would also 'make a contribution of vital significance to the advancement of humanity as a whole towards its goal of universal justice, peace and order.' 

 To the 1980 session of the Commission on Human Rights, deliberating on a 'Declaration on the 

Elimination of All Forms  
of Intolerance  and of   

Discrimination Based      
on Religion or Belief,'   

The Baha'i International  

 Community  presented a written statement containing numerous observations on the true freedom of religion and belief, pertinent to the drafting of this human rights instrument; and, in addition, made available to all participants  a detailed explanation of the Baha'i views, along with a draft Declaration incorporating  the changes suggested. Following the welcome adoption of this important Declaration by the U.N. General Assembly at its 1981 session, the 

Baha'i International      

 Community made two oral statements to the Commission on Human Rights, early in 1983, elaborat


<p403>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY 017 CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                               403

  ing its views. It pointed to education as the essential factor in eradicating prejudice and in securing implementation of the Declara-han,  and outlined the Baha'i view on the role of religion, the essential oneness and unity of all religion, and the position of Baha'u'llah as the Divine Educator for our age. 

 The statement concluded by welcoming the proposals, later approved by the Commission,  for a comprehensive and thorough study on the current dimensions of the problems  of intolerance and of discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, using as terms of reference the Declaration, and for holding a seminar, some time during 1984 —  1985, to encourage understanding, tolerance and respect 'in matters relating to freedom of religion or belief.' 

 Having followed with great interest the evolution within the United Nations system of the concept of the right to development,1 and the elaboration of a Declaration on this right, the Baha'i International Community presented a number of pertinent observations on the subject  at the 1983 session of the Commission on Human Rights. It suggested that the right to development was unique in its universality —  the universality of participation — since it could be 'achieved only through global efforts, and only through the involvement of all sectors of human society'; and that in acknowledging the rights to which all men and women are entitled, and the obligations which they owe to their fellow human beings throughout the world, a significant step was taking place in the advancement of humanity towards true world unity. 

 Further, because of the organic oneness of the human race the development of the individual could not be seen in isolation, but had to be seen as 'an essential prerequisite for the harmonious development of the society of which he is a part.' 

     The Baha'i International  

 Community was also able to express during these years its concern for the rights of indigenous peoples. In comments made to the 1983 session of the Commission on Human Rights, for instance, on the activities of the Working Group on A statement on 'The Right to Development: Exploring its 

Social and Cultural Dimensions'

 had, for instance, been submitted to a NGO Forum — Agenda for the Eighties' — held during the 1980 Special Session of the General Assembly on the New International 

Economic Order.           

 Indigenous Populations, it pointed out that over 1,900 tribes and ethnic groups were represented in the Baha'i world community, an evidence of the basic Baha'i teaching of the oneness of mankind. Earlier, observations regarding the Baha view of the importance of indigenous populations had been offered in a statement delivered at the 1981 U.N. Seminar on Protection 

Available to Victims      

 of Racial Discrimination, in Managua, Nicaragua. 

 The participation of indigenous populations in the mainstream of Baha'i worldwide activity, the Baha International Community representative explained, had provided an understanding  of the 'value of these people who are so often looked down upon from a material standpoint, but are in reality to be appreciated in their possession of certain spiritual, human qualities that are evident to those who have had time to live with them during years of close association. 

 These spiritual qualities of compassion, justice and harmony with nature are precisely what the world needs.' 

 In continuing its cooperation with the United Nations, in programs and activities for the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination (1974 — 1983), the Baha'i  International Community kept the U.N. informed of the efforts of Baha'i communities around the world to achieve racial unity and harmony and work towards the elimination of all forms of racial prejudice, by reporting from time to time on Baha'i activities in the field of education, on active participation and cooperation with United Nations programs and activities, and on implementation of the principles of racial equality and unity in the day to day social life of Baha communities in every part of the world. 

        In 1981, the Baha'i International

 Community  was asked to provide the SubCommission on Prevention of Discrimination and 

Protection of Minorities  

 with information on measures taken to eliminate racism and racial discrimination in public and private employment, and with respect to voting and election to public office. This request allowed an opportunity to explain the Baha'i view on minorities — that it is a violation of the spirit of the Baha Faith to 'discriminate against any race, on the ground of its being socially backward, politically immature, and numerically  in a minority,' and that 'if any discrimina


<p404>
404                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 tion is at all to be tolerated, it should be a discrimination not against, but rather in favor of the minority, be it racial or otherwise.' 

 This principle, the reply pointed out, guided Baha'i employment practices and the process of Baha'i ekctions, and influenced the actions of Baha'is beyond the confines of the Baha'i community. 

 In a statement to the 1982 session of the Commission on Hum~rn Rights, the 

Baha'i International Community

 pointed out that the solution to eradicating racism and racial discrimination 'lies in the recognition of the fact that we are all members of one human family and that we are all the citizens of one country, this planet earth, which is home to us all.' 

 In 1983, on the same subject, it reiterated to the Commission this point, stressing that 'all beings are created equal in the sight of God, and all should have equal opportunity to develop their potentialities in the service of mankind'; and further suggested that the Second World 

Conference on Racism       

 and Racial Discrimination, in 1983, might wish to take the important step of adopting an 'in —  depth educational programme of all peoples in the vital principle of the organic oneness of humanity.' 

 (This proposal had been made earlier in an oral statement to the 1981 'Seminar on the Relationship that 

Must Exist Between Human   

 Rights, Development and Peace.') At a regional level, besides the Managua Conference mentioned earlier, the 

Baha'i International Community

 participated in a 'Seminar on Protection to Victims of Racial Discrimination Specifically in the Areas of Asia and the Pacific,' held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1982. Again, both in an oral and a written statement, the Baha'i representative explained, in considerable detail, the Baha'i concern for human rights and the Baha'i community's longtime action in abolishing racial discrimination and racism; and outlined the achievements within the Baha'i world community, as well as worldwide Baha'i participation in U.N. activities. 
     During these years the     

Baha'i International Community

 also worked closely with other nongovernmental organizations concerned with human rights, both in New York and in Geneva. 

 As an evidence of awareness of the Baha'i concern for human rights issues, 

Mr.                        

 Gerald Knight was elected in 1982 to serve as Chairman of the NGO Committee on Human Rights at U.N. headquarters in New York. This responsibility, an expression of service to the NGO community, further contributed to the recognition of the Baha International Community as a non-governrnenta~ organization  deeply committed to the establishment of universal human rights. 
                           
Human Settlements          

 The Baha'i interest and involvement in the U.N. issue of human settlements/habitat, dating from Baha'i International Community participation in the 1976 Vancouver Conference  on Human Settlements, continued during the period 1979 — 1983 through attendance at the yearly sessions of the U.N. Commission on Human Settlements and through close contact with the U.N. Habitat 

Centre in Nairobi. In      

 1980 and 1981, when the Commission  sessions were not held, as usual, in Nairobi, the Baha'i communities of Mexico and the Philippines helped in providing representation at the Commission sessions held respectively in Mexico 

City and Manila. The Baha'i
International Community    

 continued to bring to the attention of the Commission, at these meetings, the importance of satisfying both the physical and spiritual needs of human beings in urban and rural areas, if settlements are to allow for the full expression of the potentialities of people. 

  Law of the Sea 

 A Baha'i International     

 Community delegation witnessed the successful conclusion of the Third 

United Nations Conference  

 on the Law of the Sea, when, after ten years of negotiations, a Convention was signed by 119 U.N. member states in Kingston, Jamaica, December 1982. 

 The Baha presence at numerous sessions of the Conference during those years showed clearly our appreciation for the importance of this milestone in establishing international rule over the seabed and the ocean floor — a considerable portion of the planet, and a vast resource for the wellbeing of humanity.

 combat drug abuse, working closely with the Division of Narcotic Drugs, and participating in the yearly sessions of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. A report to the 1980 session of that Commission, regarding the activities of Baha'i communities in combatting drug abuse, circulated in an official document, expressed the Baha'i view that although national and international programs of education  and medical care are of prime importance, 'essentially what is required is a spiritual impetus'; and further, that if each individual develops a consciousness 'of his innate nobility, he becomes endowed with a strength and high ideals which make him uninterested in the use of toxic and addictive substances which inflict heavy injury on his health and that of his society.' 

 In 1982, at the request of the Division of Narcotic 

Drugs, the Baha'i International Community

 offered 'Comments and Proposals on an Effective 

International Campaign    
against Traffic in Drugs.'

 The suggestions included action that might be taken by the government, society, schools, the media, parents, and important social figures. 
                          
Peace                     
     When the United Nations   

 proclaimed 1986 as International Year of Peace (JYP), as an occasion for rededication by member states to the goals of the U.N. Charter, the Baha'i International Community reiterated its expression  of interest dating to the beginnings of the U.N. in San Francisco. 

 It provided the Executive Secretary of JYP with detailed information on the Baha'i teachings and principles regarding peace, as well as evidence of the work of the Baha'i world community for over one hundred years to achieve this goal, and assured him of wholehearted Baha'i participation in that Year. 

 The decision of the U.N. in November 1981 to declare the third Tuesday in September, the opening day of the regular yearly session of the U.N. General 

Assembly, as International 

 Day of Peace, was also most welcome.  Baha'i communities worldwide will in the forthcoming years undoubtedly organize programs for this occasion, in the same spirit of cooperation they have shown for a long time in celebrating U.N. Day, Human Rights Day, and other special U.N. events. 

 A third development of significant interest to the Baha'i International Community was the establishment in San Jose, Costa Rica, with the approval of the United 

Nations, of a University  

 for Peace. Although not' financed or operated by the U.N., this University, which will function as an institution to foster peace education, has on its Council representatives from the U.N. and UNESCO. 

Both the Baha'i International

 Community and the Baha'is of Costa Rica are establishing a close relationship with the University President and with members of the University Council, and look forward to contributing to that institution, as it begins its opeiations, both the perspective of the Baha Writings and the experience of the Baha'i world community. 
                          
Population                
   Involvement of the Baha  

International Community   

 in the issue of population — a problem considered a part of the overall social and economic development of the peoples of the planet — began in 1974 through Baha'i participation in the World Population Year as well as in the World Population Conference in Bucharest, Romania. It has continued through attendance at the biennial sessions of the Population Commission. Recently, as preparations started for an International 

Conference  on Population

 in 1984, to evaluate progress made in implementing the World Plan df Action approved in Bucharest and to deliberate on future action needed, the Baha International Community joined with other nongovernmental organizations in preliminary consultations and activities relating to the Conference itself and to NGO parallel programs  that will take place at the same time. 
                          
Science and Technology    
for Development           

     The Baha'i International  

 Community was represented at the 1979 United Nations 

Conference  on Science   

 and Technology for Development (UNCSTD), in Vienna, Austria, and also took part in the programs of a parallel NonGovernmental Forum. Its statement on 'Science and Technology for Human Advancement,' was distributed as an official document to Conference delegates. While expressing the Baha'i view that science and technology are 'essential to the full development  of the individual and society,' the


<p406>
406                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  statement noted that 'much of the difficulty in applying science to development today has come from the failure to link science with the basic spiritual and moral values upon which each society is built;' that such values are derived from religion; and that 'if lasting development is to occur, religion and science, "the most potent forces in human life," must be brought into unity.' 
     At present, the Baha'i     

International Community   

 is in contact with the Centre for Science and Technology for Development, and participates in the yearly sessions of the Intergovernmental Committee of Science and Technology for Development, a body which has welcomed cooperation by nongovernmental organizations concerned with this vital issue. 
                           
Women                      
   From the time that the     

Baha International Community

 was granted consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 1970, it has taken a very active part in U.N. activities to promote the advancement of women. It has presented statements explaining the Baha'i view on issues related to women to the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, to two world conferences on women, and to meetings held by U.N. Regional Economic Commissions in preparation for those Conferences. 

 It has also replied to questionnaires received from the U.N. Branch for the Advancement of Women and submitted in the form of reports the Baha'i view in specific areas such as employment  and education. More information has probably been submitted to the United Nations on the status of women than on any other issue. 

 One of the earliest reports shared with the United Nations based on replies to a questionnaire  prepared by the Baha'i International Community was on the status of women in Baha communities. 

 Although the findings were preliminary in nature, they provided evidence of the deep concern in the world Baha'i community for the condition of women, of the educational process in which Baha'is are involved to attain equality, and of the expectations for future expanded social and economic activities to promote the development of women. 

 In 1980, to survey progress made during the first half of the United Nations Decade for Women (1976 — 1985), a Second World Conference on Women was held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Again there was Baha'i representation at four regional preparatory conferences  held respectively in Paris, New Delhi, Macuto (Venezuela), and Lusaka. 

 A delegation  of women represented the Baha'i International Community at the Copenhagen Conference, and with the cooperation of the Danish Baha'i Community, the Baha'i International Community was able to make a contribution to parallel NGO activities. 

 In its statement to the Copenhagen Conference, the Baha'i International Community stressed two important principles which it felt would guide men and women 'to a dedication to the best interests of humanity, in a spirit of service rather than of competition and confrontation.' 

 The first principle was that 'the most effective motivation for change' was 'a declaration of equality of the sexes based on a universally ackowledged authority and having influence on the hearts and minds of people.' Further, 'recognition of this authority' had to be freely given, and 'attract all nationalities, races, and classes to its validity' instilling 'the desire to abandon prejudice in favor of loving cooperation.' 

 The second principle was that 'an authoritative statement of equality must be binding on men as well as women, since it is essential that men recognize the equal status of women for women to be free from the struggle for their rights, and for each sex to complement and help the other.' 

 A special booklet containing excerpts from the numerous 

Baha'i International       

 Community  submissions to the United Nations on the equality of men and women, entitled 'Universal Values for the Advancement of Women,' was also prepared for the Conference,  and widely distributed. 
   In addition the Baha'i     

International Community   

 attended sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women, and was active in meetings of the NGO Committee on the U.N. Decade for 

Women in New York — where Mrs.

 Mary Sawicki, for many years a Baha'i International 

Community Alternate Representative 

 for special meetings, served as Vice-Chairperson  — and in Geneva.

<p408>
408                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The enthusiastic participation of the Baha'i International Community in United Nations activities related to women has led to widespread  appreciation of the Baha'i views on the significance of equality in establishing universal peace and social and economic development. 

The Baha'i International  

 Community is increasingly identified, as a result, with the worldwide network of people and organizations working in a spirit of friendly cooperation to remove traditional barriers to women's advancement and to encourage and promote the positive attitudes vital to the achievement of full equality for men and women. 
                          
Youth                     

 When, in December 1979, the U.N. General Assembly proclaimed 1985 as International Youth Year (IYY) — with the themes of Participation,  Development and Peace — and decided to establish an Advisory Committee for IYY to formulate a specific program of measures and activities to be undertaken prior to and during JYY, the Baha'i International Community, whose involvement for many years in youth issues at the U.N. had included participation in the 1970 World Youth 

Assembly  in New York    

 and the 1973 U.N. Seminar on Youth and Human Rights in San Remo, Italy, warmly welcomed this decision, since it would permit an even more substantive  Baha'i expression of the vital role that youth can play in bringing about world peace and in building a world civilization. 

    Accordingly the Baha'i    
International Community  

 took part in the first and second sessions of the JYY Advisory Committee and established a close relationship with the U.N. Secretariat for IYY at the Vienna International Centre. Further, when the NGO Youth Caucus — which, responding to an invitation, sent two representatives to the 1981 Baha Youth 

Conference in Kansas      

 City, Missouri, U.S.A — became formally constituted as a NGO Committee on Youth, under  the Conference of NonGovernmental Organizations in Consuhative Status with ECOSOC (CONGO), the 

Baha'i International Community
was elected to the Executive Board.

 It has continued to play an active role in the work of the Committee as well as its two SubCommittees on IYY and Tree Planting, and the Baha'i International Community repre sentative has, in addition, helped plan the September 

1983 Annual DPTINGO Conference 

 on the theme of 'The Challenge of Youth in 

Our Changing Society.'    
 The Baha'i International  

 Community will continue to serve as liaison with Baha'i national communities, providing information, materials, and suggestions to assist Baha'i youth to undertake activities and projects that will make a contribution to the valuable goals of 

IYY.                      
                          
Cooperation with NonGovernmental
Organizations            
    The Baha International   

 Community relationship with nongovernmental organizations  continued with the same spirit of harmony and cooperation expressed in the past, through participation during this period in activities of the Conference of NGO's in Consultative Status with ECOSOC and its various committees on development, U.N. Women's Decade, environment, disarmament, human rights, and the aging, in New York, Geneva, and now Vienna. It also worked close-~y  with the NGO Committee on UNICEF and its subcommittees on issues such as the disabled child and infant feeding. In its relationship  with the Department of Public Information the Baha'i International Community  attended regular briefings on U.N. issues and participated in the 

Annual DPI! NGO Conferences.
     Baha'i International Community

 representatives  helped to plan and run a number of activities, such as seminars, symposia, and luncheons. 

 These representatives contributed their time and expertise to several NGO executive committees and boards, and now serve as Chairmen of the NGO 

Committee on UNICEF (Dr.  

 Victor de Araujo) and of the NGO Committee on 

Human Rights (New York)   

 (Mr. Gerald Knight), and as Vice-Chairmen of the DPI/NGO Executive 

Committee  (Mr. Gerald   

 Knight) and of the Committee on the U.N. Decade for Women (Mrs. Mary Sawicki). 
  From time to time the     

Baha International Community

 cosponsored statements with other nongovernmental organizations, as it had in the past, when these were constructive and nonpolitical in nature. 

 It also continued occasionally to take part in conferences organ


<p409>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                     409

  ized by nongovernmental organizations on subjects of special Baki'f interest. 

 Such were the 10th Conference on the Law of the World, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 1981, and the United Towns Conference, Casablanca, Morocco, November, 1981 — and the previously mentioned  World Congresses on Mental Health. 

  Relationship of the Baha'i 

International Community   
to the South Pacific       

Commission                 
  The Baha'i International  

 Community began its participation in the work of the South Pacific Commission in 1978 when it was invited  to attend the 18th South Pacific Conference  — one of the yearly meetings of the Commission — in Noumea, New Caledonia. Since then, because of the strong interest of the Baha'i community of the Pacific in the work of the Commission, and with the assistance  and recommendations of the Continental  Board of Counsellors for Australasia, it has pursued its involvement in the activities of this important intergovernmental body, whose aim is to promote the economic and social wellbeing and advancement of the peoples of the Pacific Island countries and territories. 

    Accordingly the Baha'i    
International Community   
attended the South Pacific 

Conferences               

 ences in Papeete, Tahiti (1979), Port Moresby, Papua 

New Guinea (1980), Port    

 Vila, Vanuatu  (1981), and Pago Pago, American Samoa (1982). An oral statement on the issue of children — 'Meeting the Needs of Island Children'  — was made to the Tahiti Conference; and written statements were circulated to the three other conferences, respectively on 'Spiritual and Social Values for Rural Development,' 'The Preservation of the High Qualities of Life in the Pacific,' and 'Rural Development: 

The Bases for Progress     

 in the Pacific.' Mrs. Tinai Hancock, a member of the Continental Board of Counsellors for Australasia, most ably represented the Baha'i International Community at these conferences with the assistance of alternate representatives from different Baha'i communities in the Pacific. 

 Having made the South Pacific Commission aware of the intense Baha'i concern for the wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific area, in their spiritual as well as physical development, a new stage of cooperation was beginning  to unfold, as it became evident that the Commission would like to work closely with Baha'i communities in rural development programs — through Baha'i community projects or participation in SPC projects — to improve the quality of life of the Island peoples.

3. ACTIVITIES OF THE BAHA'I INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY RELATING TO THE PERSECUTION
            OF THE BAHA'I FAITH IN IRAN
              Ridvan 1979 — Ridvan 1983

  THE activities of the 

Baha'i International Community

 in connection with the persecution  of the Baha'i community of fr~in began during the months of revolutionary turmoil that preceded the overthrow of the 

Pahiavi r6gime. (Details   

 of the persecutions suffered by the Baha during that period are to be found on page 79 of vol. XVII of The Baha'i World.) 
In November 1978 the       

Baha'i International      

 Community issued a statement to the international news media, emphasizing the perilous situation of the Baha'i community of fran and explaining the true nature and teachings of the Baha Faith (which had frequently been misrepresented in media reports  on the disturbances in fr6n). 

 Detailed information concerning the persecutions was sent to the Secretary-General and senior human rights officials of the United Nations. The following month, the Baha'i International Community addressed a direct appeal to UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, urging him to intervene to protect the lives and properties of the Baha'is in IrAn. 

 Following the accession to power of Irdn's revolutionary government early in 1979, the Baha'i International Community, on behalf of the Baha'is of the world, cabled Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan to request that the Baha'i religious minority be granted full recognition and protection under the new Iranian Constitution,  which was at that time being drafted. Two months later, in May 

1979, the Baha'i International

 Community again cabled Prime Minister Bazargan, expressing the dismay of the Baha'i world at the continuing attacks on the Baha and the, seizure of their holy places, refuting in detail the many false allegations being propagated in I r~n against the Baha'i Faith and its followers, and requesting  once again that the Baha'i minority be granted constitutional recognition and protection. 

  Throughout 1979 the Baha  
International Community    
wrote repeatedly to the    

Iranian                    

 Mission to the United Nations, expressing its grave concern at each adverse development in the situation of the Baha and urgently seeking an appointment to discuss the matter. The Iranian Charg6 d'Affaires, Mr. Jamal Shemirani, agreed to oniy one meeting, held in June 1979, when he assured Dr. Victor de Araujo, representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations, that the government of the Islamic Republic of IrAn was firmly committed to protecting the lives and properties of all its citizens, and that the Baha'i holy places in I r~n had been taken over by the government solely for their protection. 

 Despite these assurances, the situation continued to deteriorate and, in 

September 1979, the Baha'i 
International Community    

 found it necessary to cable Prime Minister Bazargan as follows: 

HAVE RECEIVED DISTRESSING  
NEWS THAT IRRESPONSIBLE   
PERSONS HAVE ASSEMBLED     
TO DEMOLISH  THE HOUSE    
OF THE Bab IN SHIRAZ       
THE HOLIEST PLACE FOR      
BAHAIS IN IRAN             
STRONGLY REQUEST YOUR      
EXCELLENCY INTERCEDE      
TO PREVENT THIS RASH       
AND UNBEFIrrING            
ACTION WHICH WILL CAUSE    
CONSTERNATION              
TO BAHAIS THROUGHOUT THE   
WORLD                      

  This message, like those before it, failed to elicit any response from the Iranian government,  and it was at this point that the Baha'i International Community first took steps to bring the plight of the Baha'is in Iran formally to the attention of government representatives to the United Nations. 

 A letter was sent to the UN Ambassadors of almost one hundred nations, conveying the shock and dismay of the Baha'i world at the wanton destruction of the House of the Mb. 

 The Ambassadors were not requested to intervene at this stage, since it was still hoped that, as the situation in fran stabilized, the Iranian government would take steps to control the fanatical elements within the country and to


<p415>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                415

  provide relief and protection for the Baha'is. For similar reasons no action was taken to raise the issue for debate by the human rights organs of the United 

Nations. The UN Secretary-General
and the Director of the    

UN Centre for Human Rights 

 were, however, kept fully informed of all developments pertaining  to the situation of the Baha'is. When, in 

February 1986, a UN Commission

 of Inquiry was appointed to visit frdn for the purpose of receiving testimony concerning allegedviolations of human rights perpetrated during the Pahiavi r6gime, the 

Baha'i International      

 Community was able to submit to the five expert members of that body a detailed account of the acts of discrimination and persecution suffered by the Baha'i community between the years 1921 and 1978, evidence which clearly refuted the false allegation that the Baha'is had been closely affiliated with and had consequently benefited from the former r6gime. 

     In June 1980 Mr. Gerald    

 Knight, alternate representative of the Baha International Community to the United Nations, met lr~n's new Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Mansour Farhang, and conveyed to him the Baha'i 

International Community's  

 grave concern  at the ever-increasing scale of the persecutions  against the Baha'i community in Ir6n. Ambassador Farhang stated that the Iranian government was not itself opposed to the Baha'is, that there was no organized movement in IrTh against the Baha'is, and that the attacks upon them were the work of fanatical elements which the government was not yet able to control. 

 As the persecutions intensified the Baha'i International Community appealed once again to UN Secretary-General Waldheim to intervene with the Iranian authorities on behalf of the Baha'is. 

 The UN correspondents of the international media were kept closely informed of developments and the 

Baha'i International Community

 sought the assistance of appropriate nongovernmental organizations  — notably Amnesty International, the International League for Human Rights and the 

International Commission   

 of Jurists —  in increasing international awareness of the plight of the Baha'is of IrAn. Urgent appeals were addressed to Ambassador Farhang, and later to President Bani-sadr and 

Prime Mm                   

 ister Rajai of fr6n, strongly protesting the arbitrary arrests of Baha'is on manifestly false charges and urging them to intervene to protect the oppressed Baha minority. 

     In July 1980 the Baha     
International Community   

 wrote for the second time to UN Ambassadors, reporting the summary execution  of two members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tabrfz, recounting the manifold persecutions being suffered by the friends in IrAn, and briefly explaining the nature and teachings of the Baha Faith. The following month a further letter was sent to the same Ambassadors, reporting the arrest of the entire membership of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of frTh and rebutting the false charge of espionage that had been levelled against them. In both letters, the Baha'i International Community appealed to the Ambassadors and their governments to use their good offices to persuade the Iranian government to take steps to alleviate the plight of the Baha'is. 

 When it became apparent that all appeals to the Iranian government were going unheeded, the Universal House of Justice directed the Baha'i International Community to appeal to international bodies to take action on behalf of the beleaguered friends in frdn. 

 The first body to which an appeal was made was the United Nations SubCommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, a body composed of twenty-six independent experts from all parts of the world. 
In its statement to the    

SubCommission,  the Baha'i
International Community   

 described the many violations of human fights suffered by the Baha'i community since the start of the Iranian Revolution and emphasized the escalating nature of the persecution.  On 10 September 1980 the SubCommission  adopted a resolution in which it expressed its profound concern for the safety of the recently-arrested members of the National Spiritual Assembly and invited the government of fr6n to protect the fundamental  human fights and freedoms of the Baha'i minority.' 

  The Baha'i International  

 Community coordinated the efforts of the National Spiritual Assemblies of Europe to bring the plight of SubCommission resolution

  the Baha'is in I r~n to the attention of European parliamentarians prior to the September 1980 meetings of the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Coun-cii of Europe. Appropriate documentation was prepared by the Baha'i International Community for circulation to European parliamentarians  and government officials. 

 On 19 September 1980 the Baha'i delegation, which included a representative from each of the nine member states of the European Community,  had the satisfaction of witnessing the adoption by the 410-member European Parliament  of a unanimous resolution condemning the persecution of the Baha in I din and calling upon the government of fran to grant recognition to the Baha'i community.1 

    A smaller Baha'i International

 Community delegation remained in Strasbourg to cover the meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Numerous interviews were arranged at which the situation of the Baha'is in Iran was discussed in detail with Ambassadors and human rights officials at the Council of Europe. 

On 29 September 1980       

 the Parliamentary Assembly published a Written Declaration calling upon the Committee of Ministers of the twenty-one member states of the Council of Europe to make urgent representations  to the Iranian authorities to put an end to the persecution of the Baha Following the resolution of the European Parliament, the foreign ministers of several member governments of the European Community informed the Baha'is in their own countries that the nine member states of the European Community shared the concern of the European parliamentarians for the plight of the Baha'is in fr6n. Since efforts to improve the treatment of the Baha'is had produced no positive results, the 

Baha'i International Community

 took the matter to the human rights organs of the United Nations. 

 Acting on this recommendation, the Baha'i International Community made two statements at the 37th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights at its February/March 1981 meeting in Geneva. 

  Resolution not numbered.

 2 For text see Parliamentary Assembly document no. 

4622 — Written Declaration   

 No. 88 (3rd edition) of 11 May 1981 (originally tabled on 29 September 1980). 

 This step represented a milestone in efforts to alleviate the sufferings of the Baha'is in Iran, since it was the first occasion on which the Baha case had been officially presented to a truly international body of governments — in this case, a body composed of forty-three member states of the United Nations from every continent of the world. 

 In its first statement the Baha'i International Community drew the attention of the Commission  to the kidnapping and subsequent disappearance of fourteen prominent Baha'is in Iran. In its second statement, the 

Baha International Community

 described the persecutions in I ran, emphasized their systematic nature, and explained the significance of the deliberate omission of the Baha'i minority from the Iranian Constitution. 

 Many delegations from the one hundred or so governments represented at the Commission,  either as members or observers, were extremely sympathetic to the Baha'i case and four governments — Australia, 

Canada, the Netherlands    

 and the United Kingdom —  made specific references to the persecution of the Baha'is in frTh in general statements on the violation of human rights. In response, the representative of I din categorically denied that Baha'is were being arrested, executed and abducted in I r~n and affirmed that the Baha minority enjoyed full rights and protection  under the 

Iranian Constitution.      

 Concerned at the Iranian government's failure to respond to any of the appeals so far addressed to it, the Baha'i International Community again worked closely with the National Spiritual 

Assemblies of Europe       

 to launch a further appeal to European parliamentarians. 
The response was immediate.

On 10 April 1981 the European

 Parliament adopted  its second unanimous resolution on the Baha'i case, calling on the foreign ministers of the ten member states of the European Community (Greece had joined the nine in January 1981) to make urgent representations to the Iranian government 'to secure the release of members of the Baha'i community currently in detention merely on account of their religious beliefs, and to prevent any persecution of and discrimination against the Baha'i minority in frTh' .~ The following Resolution not numbered. 

 Text appears in the Official Journal of the European Communities, Volume 24, reference C 101.


<p418>
418                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 month the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe tabled a resolution in which it voiced its grave concern at the 'escalation in the systematic campaign of persecution being waged against the Baha'is in IrAn' and recommended that the matter be brought to the attention of the 

United Nations General     
Assembly. 1                

 In a statement to the European Parliament on 6 May 1981, the foreign minister of the Netherlands (the then chairman of the Council of Ministers of the European Community) stated that the situation of the Baha'is had been discussed by the Council of Ministers  on various occasions and would continue to receive the full attention of the ten member states. 

 Later in the same month the Baha'i International Community was invited by the government of the Netherlands to prepare a brief general statement concerning the Iranian Baha'i community for transmittal to the Ambassadors  of the ten in Tehran. The concern of these governments was further manifested at the spring 1981 meeting in New York of the United Nations Economic and 

Social Council (ECOSOC)    

 where, in a joint statement dealing  with religious intolerance, the ten member states of the European Community drew the attention of ECOSOC's fifty-four member governments to the perilous situation of the Baha'is in fr6n. 

 The representative of Canada also referred to the Baha in his remarks on the same subject. 

 The Baha'i International    

 Community meanwhile  continued its efforts to win some relief for the suffering friends in Iran. Details of the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping and subsequent disappearance of fourteen prominent Baha'is were documented and submitted to the five-member 

UN Working Group on Enforced

 or Involuntary Disappearances  — a subsidiary body of the Commission  on Human Rights — which met in closed session in New York early in May 1981. By poignant coincidence, the wife of one of the disappeared members of the National Assembly of IrAn was visiting New York at that time and the Baha International Community  took steps to ensure that the members of the Working Group received her firsthand account of her husband's arrest and of her 

Parliamentary Assembly     
document no. 4733 of

  1981. 

 subsequent attempts to trace him. Arrangements were also made for this courageous lady to share her experiences with diplomats and senior human rights officials at the United Nations, including the Director of the UN Division for Human Rights; Mr. 

Theo van Boven. The Working

 Group subsequently raised the question of the disappearances with the Iranian authorities, who disclaimed responsibility and denied all knowledge of the whereabouts or fate of the missing Baha'is. 

 It had by this time become apparent that the persecutions in frdn were not only continuing  but were increasing both in severity and scale, and the Baha International Community  accordingly intensified its efforts to publicize the plight of. the Baha'is and to win further international support for their case. Although it appeared unlikely that the government  of I rttn would respond favourably to international appeals on behalf of the Baha, it was clearly important to ensure that the campaign of persecution was not allowed to proceed in a semi-clandestine manner and that the Iranian authorities were made fully aware of the fact that any acts of persecution against the Baha'i community would inevitably attract widespread international publicity and condemnation. 

       The Baha'i International   

 Community accordingly initiated a policy, which it has continued, of reporting immediately not oniy to the UN Secretary-General (as it had always done) but also to governments (through their UN Ambassadors) each time a major new incident of persecution occurred. 

 In response to the appeals which accompanied these reports, the Secretary-General and a number of individual governments repeatedly made their concern for the Baha'is known to the Iranian authorities through appropriate diplomatic  channels. 

 Media correspondents at the United Nations were likewise informed of each new development in fr4n. There was a consequent renewal of interest in the Baha'i case, resulting in increased press coverage of the persecutions, as well as radio and television interviews in which representatives of the Baha'i International Community were able to increase public awareness of the sufferings of their fellow believers in IrAn. 

 Additional steps were taken by the Baha'i International Community to ensure that the


<p419>
INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES                                419

 plight of the Baha'is became not only more widely known but also more fully understood. A major step was the publication, in June 1981, of a report entitled The Baha'is in Iran:     A Report on the Persecution of a Relikious Minority, which documented the persecutions, examined their historical background  and motivation, discussed and refuted the false charges customarily levelled against the Baha'is by the Iranian authorities, charted the course of international efforts to halt the persecutions, and briefly explained the major principles of the Baha'i Faith. Published in English, French and Spanish, this 86-page illustrated brochure was made available to National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world for use in their contacts with parliamentarians, civil servants, prominent persons and the media in their own countries. 

 Copies were circulated by the Baha'i International Community  to UN Ambassadors, the Secretary-General, human rights officials in New York and Geneva, nongovernmental organizations concerned with human rights and UN correspondents  of the international media. 

 The report was subsequently distributed by the Baha 

International Community    

 at every UN meeting at which human rights violations in Iran were discussed and quickly became the standard reference document on the Baha'i case. The information it contained was updated  by a supplementary report published in November 1981. A revised and fully updated edition was published in July 1982. 

 Two further documents were prepared by the Baha 

International Community    

 specifically  for the information of government representatives  and human rights officials: the first, a chronological summary of individual acts of persecution against Baha'is in fr4n during the period 

August 1978 to September 1981;

 the second, a compilation of official documentation from frdn testifying to religious  discrimination against the members of the Baha'i community. 
  By the time the United     

Nations General Assembly   

 met for its 36th session from September  to December 1981, the persecution of the Baha'is in Ir6n was generally recognized as being the foremost example of religious intolerance in the contemporary world, and was frequently cited as such. The sufferings endured by the Baha served to focus the attention of governments on the need to establish international standards for the protection  of the right to freedom of religion and the plight of the Baha'is was much in the mind of delegates when, on 25 November 

1981, the General Assembly 

 voted in plenary session to adopt the Declaration on the Elimination of All 

Forms of Intolerance       

 and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. The adoption of this major new international human rights instrument was widely considered to be one of the most important achievements  of the 36th General Asse.mbly, and certainly the most important recent achievement  of the Commission on Human Rights (which drafted it) and of its parent body, the Economic and Social Council (which passed it to the General Assembly for adoption). 

 Following  the adoption of this historic Declaration, the delegation of fr6n took the floor to indicate that it could support the Declaration 'insofar as it is in total conformity with islamic jurisprudence'. 
   Many delegations at the    

36th General Assembly      

 expressed their anxiety over the human rights situation in Ir6n and the governments  of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom (on behalf of the ten member states of the European Community) and the United States referred specifically to the persecution of the Baha'is. The delegation of fran responded by denying that Baha'is were persecuted for their religion and by alleging that the Baha'i Faith was not a religion but a political tool of western colonialism. 

 A large number of delegations expressed their concern at the growing incidence of summary and arbitrary executions in various parts of the world, and the United Kingdom (on behalf of the ten member states of the European Community) made specific reference to the executions in Iran. 

The General Assembly      

 adopted a resolution condemning these practices and requesting the UN 

Committee on Crime Prevention

 and Control to examine the problem at its 7th session in March 1982. The Baha'i 

International Community    

 sent a representative to the meeting of that Committee  in Vienna, to provide information about the summary and arbitrary executions of Baha'is in Irhn during the previous two years. 

 In a statement at the 34th session of


<p420>
420                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 the United Nations SubCommission on Prevention  of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, the Baha'i International Community  drew attention to the fact that the persecutions in IrAn were not oniy intensifying but were becoming increasingly official in nature and that mere membership in the Baha'i community and participation in Baha'i activities was now being treated by the courts as a capital offence. On 19 September 1981 the SubCommission adopted its second resolution on the Baha'i case. This resolution — cosponsored by members from Africa, 

Latin America, Europe      

 and Asia — drew the attention of the Commission on Human Rights (the parent body of the SubCommission) to the 'perilous situation faced by the Baha community in Iran' and requested the UN Secretary-General to 'submit all relevant information  about the treatment of the Baha'is in Iran to the Commission on Human Rights '1 at its thirty-eighth session While in Europe for the 

SubCommission, Gerald     

 Knight met with foreign ministry officials in Paris and Stockholm, spoke in Bonn at a reception for parliamentarians hosted by the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and, at a Baha conference in London, briefed the 

Continental Board of Counsellors

 and members of the National Assemblies of Europe on the work being carried out by the 

Baha'i International       

 Community  in connection with the situation in Iran. 

 In a statement issued on 25 November 1981, the 

Committee of Ministers     

 of the Council of Europe expressed its deep concern over reports  of the continuing persecution of the Baha, called for an intensification of the endeavours of the United Nations to improve the lot of the Baha community in Iran, and indicated that it would closely follow developments  at the forthcoming 38th session of the Commission on Human Rights. 

   Early in January 1982      

 the Baha International Community, on behalf of the Baha'is of the world, cabled Ayatollah 

Khomeini, Prime Minister   

 Mir ilusayn Musavi and the President of the Supreme Court of I ifin, Ayatollah Musavi Ardibili, protesting the recent secret executions of eight members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of fran and seven other Baha, including six members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihr6n who had been condemned to death on false charges of espionage. The cable called upon the Iranian leaders to take steps to halt the summary arrest and execution of Baha'is, to require those responsible for formulating charges against the Baha'is to produce documentary evidence in support of those charges and to extend to the members of the Baha'i community the right — which had been rigidly denied to them — to defend themselves and disprove publicly the false and malicious charges brought against them. 

 A nineteen-member Baha'i delegation attended  the January 1982 meeting in Strasbourg  of the 

Parliamentary Assembly     
of the Council of Europe.  

 The delegation was composed of representatives of the National Assemblies of sixteen of the twenty-one member states of the Council of Europe, together with representatives of the 

Baha'i International      

 Community to the United Nations in New York and Geneva. On the agenda of the parliamentary Assembly for Friday 29 January 1982 was the item: 'Persecutions in mm: Rapporteur M. Dejardin.' 

 Monsieur Dejardin's report dealt with the overall human  rights situation in I r~n and contained extensive references to the persecution of the Baha'is. During the two-hour debate that followed the presentation of this report, eighteen speakers from ten different countries expressed their horror at the massive violations of human fights taking place in fran and focused especially on the religious persecution of the Baha'is. Some speakers strongly urged the Commission on Human Rights to take action on the Baha'i case. At the conclusion of the debate the Parliamentary Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution in which it expressed its wholehearted support for the attitudes taken by the SubCommission and called upon the government of fr6n to extend constitutional guarantees to the Baha'i community.2 

 A major diplomatic initiative was jointly launched by fifteen governments — the ten member states of the European Community, together with Australia, Norway, Portugal, 2 Parliamentary Assembly resolution 768 (1982).

  Sweden and Switzerland — which, on 31 January  1982, made a dfmarche (formal representation) to the Iranian government in Tihr6n. The text of the &marche expressed profound concern at the recent executions of prominent Baha, drew the attention of the Iranian government to the relevant provisions of the major international human rights instruments (to which Ir6n had subscribed) and stated that the fifteen governments wished to receive assurances that those provisions would be respected in the case of members of the Baha'i community in IrAn. 

 As requested by the SubCommission in its resolution of 19 September 1981, a report on the treatment of the Baha'is in fr6n was prepared by the UN Secretary-General and circulated to delegates at the 38th session of the 

Commission on Human Rights.1

 The report included a summary of the information contained in the Baha'i International Community  publication 

The Baha'is in Inin:      

 A Report on the Persecution of a Religious Minority and its November 1981 update. 

 Extensive references were made at the Commission to the human rights situation in fr6n and thirteen of the Commission's forty-three member governments referred specifically  to the plight of the Baha. The representative of IrAn responded to these expressions  of concern by attacking the bona fides of the human rights organs of the United Nations in taking up the case of the Baha'is and by claiming that historical links existed between the Baha'u'llah and western colonialism, that the Baha'is were opponents of Isl6m and political supporters of the late Shah, that no Baha'i was persecuted in frhn because of his religion and that those who had been executed or imprisoned had been involved  in espionage 'and other activities contrary to the higher interests of the Islamic Republic of fnin'. 

 In the first of its two statements at the Commission, the Baha International Community  quoted numerous examples of recent actions taken by the Iranian authorities against the Baha'is, both individually and as a community,  which clearly demonstrated the purely religious nature of the persecution. In its second statement, the Baha'i International Community comprehensively rebutted the false allegations made by the representative of I An, explaining that these charges had been fabricated by the Iranian authorities in order to justify their anti-Bah&f activities and to conceal the fact that the persecution was motivated solely by primitive religious prejudice. 

 In both its statements the Baha'i International Community emphasized that the goal of the campaign of persecution was to eradicate the Baha community and obliterate all traces of the Baha'i Faith in the land of its birth. 

 A resolution, sponsored by nine governments  and supported by delegations from Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Europe, Australia and the Pacific, was adopted  by the Commission on 11 March 1982. This resolution, which firmly established lr6n on the human rights agenda of the United Nations, called upon UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to establish direct contacts with the Iranian government on the human rights situation prevailing in fr6n, to 'continue his efforts to endeavour to ensure that the Baha'is are guaranteed full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms' and to submit a report to the Commission at its 39th session.2 

 Following the Commission, Gerald Knight, alternate representative of the 

Baha'i International     

 Community to the United Nations in New York, and Giovanni Baha'u'llah, representative of the Baha International Community to the United Nations in Geneva, visited Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland. 

 In each country they met with government officials, spoke at public meetings and pattici-pated  in press conferences which resulted in unprecedented coverage by the Scandinavian press, radio and television services not only of the persecutions in fran but also of the Baha'i Faith itself. Mr. Knight was subsequently interviewed by the press and radio in Iceland and by BBC television in the United 

Kingdom.                 

 The genocidal nature of the campaign against the Baha'i community in IrAn was by now widely recognized and Gerald Knight was one of the three speakers invited to address a Symposium on Genocide held in London on 20 March 1982. The symposium was organized UN document EICN.4/1517 of 31 December 1981.     2 Commission on Human Rights resolution 1982/27.

422                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  by an ad hoc coalition of nongovernmental organizations under the leadership of Professor  Leo Kuyper, an international expert on genocide. In his presentation, Mr. Knight highlighted the genocidal features of the Iranian government's campaign against the Baha'is and, at the request of the organizers of the symposium, put forward his views and recommendations on the proposed establishment of a new international human rights agency dealing specifically with cases of genocide. 

 At the spring 1982 session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, a number of governments expressed their continuing concern at the deteriorating situation of the Baha'is in IrAn. On 17 July 1982, seventeen  governments — the ten member states of the European Community, together with Australia,  Austria, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland — made a joint d~-marche  to the Iranian government in Tihr6n, protesting its treatment of the Baha'is. 

 Later in the same year, on 27 December 1982, all the above governments save Finland made a further joint dtmarche to the Iranian government,  once again calling for justice and fair treatment for the Baha'i community. 

 Concern for the Baha'is was also voiced by members of the United Nations 

Human Rights Committee — a   

 body of eighteen independent experts — when, at its 16th session in Geneva in July 1982, it reviewed with representatives of the government of fr6n the progress being made in Ir6n in implementing the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and 

Political Rights. The      

 Committee had at its disposal a copy of the Iranian Constitution and also documentation from the Baha International Community concerning the persecution of the Baha minority. It was evident to the members of the Committee that both the constitutional law of Iran and the day-to-day practices of the Iranian authorities fell far short of the standards set out in the Covenant and many members expressed their unease at the ambivalence of those provisions of the Constitution which purported to protect fundamental human rights, particularly those which concerned the rights of non-Muslim citizens. 

 Responding to the Committee's comments,  the leader of the Iranian delegation, Ayatollah Siyyid Fladi Khosroshahi, decried the fact that many Committee members had raised specific questions concerning the Baha'is.  lie gave no direct answers to the searching questions posed by the Committee but simply asserted that a relatively small number of Baha had been executed in iran and that their executions had nothing to do with their religious beliefs. 

 At the 37th session of the United Nations General 

Assembly, from September   

 to December  1982, many governments expressed their grave anxiety over the human fights situation in frAn and referred specifically to the religious persecution of the Baha. 

 The Iranian delegation responded with anger, charging that these governments were motivated  by political rather than humanitarian considerations and declaring that the government  of IrAn had no intention of changing its domestic policies. 

 On 23 November 1982 the Iranian delegation  circulated to representatives to the Third Committee (the 

Social, Cultural and Humanitarian

 Affairs Committee) of the 37th General Assembly a document entitled Human Rights in the Islamic 

Republic of Iran — A Review  

 of the Facts. Section 2 of the document,  headed 'Religious Persecution?', was devoted exclusively to an attack on the Baha Faith and its followers. The document denied that Baha were being persecuted in Ir6n because of their religious beliefs, charged that the Baha'i Faith was a political entity 'created and nourished by anti-Islamic and colonial powers', claimed that the Baha'is had established  'a very sophisticated and systematic espionage network' and alleged that the followers  of the Baha'i Faith worldwide were engaged in spying for various governments and in financially supporting 

Zionism.                   
    The Baha'i International   

 Community immediately prepared and circulated to representatives  to the Third Committee a written statement rebutting the false charges contained in the Iranian document and calling for the appointment of an impartial body of enquiry to investigate the entire situation. Copies of the rebuttal statement, together with relevant extracts from the Iranian document,  were also sent to the Ambassadors of all 157 member governments of the United Nations.

  it appropriate to communicate with every UN Ambassador concerning the situation of the Baha'is in IrAn, and this unprecedented step was taken solely as a resuft of the Iranian government's action in propagating its outrageous  charges at the highest internafional forum. 

    The Baha'i International   

 Community's rebuttal statement was subsequently circulated as an official document of the United Nations at the 39th session of the Commission on Human Rights at its January/March 1983 meeting in Geneva. 

 It was contained in a comprehensive  report prepared by the Secretary-General on the human rights situation in IrAn. This lengthy report — prepared pursuant to the Commission~ s resolution of 11 March 1982 —  contained extensive references to the persecution  of the Baha'is, based on information provided by the Baha'i International Community  and a number of concerned nongovernmental organizations, such as 

Amnesty International      
and the International      

Commission  of Jurists.   

 The report also contained information submitted to the Secretary-General by the Iranian government, including the text of the document circulated by IrAn at the 37th General 

Assembly.'                 

 In a separate document circulated at the Commission, the Secretary-General reported on the direct contacts he had established with the Iranian government concerning the general human rights situation prevailing in frAn. Paragraph 3 of that report read as follows: CDuring the past year, the Secretary-General discussed reports of human rights violations with the Permanent Representative of the Islamic 

Republic of Iran. Among    

 the related topics, the Secretary-General referred to reports  of the persecution and, in some cases, summary execution of members of the Baha'i religious community. In this connection, 

Ambassador  Rajai Khorassani

 said that nobody was persecuted in Iran because of his religious beliefs and that, in his Government's view, the Baha'is were not a religious group but, rather, a political movement aimed at creating division among the people of Iran.'2 

   The Baha'i International   

 Community made three statements at the Commission concerning the situation of the Baha in fr6n. The 

UN document E/CN.4/1983/19 
of 22 February 1983. 2     

UN document F/CN.4/1983/5Yof
22 February 1983.          

 first statement, under the agenda item dealing with enforced or involuntary disappearances, drew the attention of the Commission to the fact that fourteen prominent Baha'is, and also two abducted Baha'i schoolgirls, were still missing in Ir6n. The statement included an urgent request to the Commission to appeal to the Iranian government to commute the death sentences recently passed on twenty-two Baha'is by the revolutionary court of Shfr~z. This request was repeated in the Baha'i International Community's second statement, which also emphasized the fact that Baha'is were being condemned to death solely on the grounds of their religion. 

 Responding to the second statement, the delegation of Irhn denied any religious persecution  of Baha'is and charged that the Baha'i 

International Community's  

 sole purpose  in attending the Commission was to launch 'baseless propaganda' against the Islamic  Republic of fr6n. The Iranian representative  also claimed (inaccurately) that the Baha'i 

International Community    

 had made no contribution whatsoever to the work of the Commission. 

 The human rights situation in frgn was a major focus of attention at the Commission and the governments of Australia, Canada, D~nmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, 

Togo, the United Kingdom   

 and the United States specifically expressed their concern  for the Baha'is. A number of delegations included in their statements appeals to the Iranian government to spare the lives of the Baha'is condemned to death in Shfr4z. 

 In its third and major statement at the Commission, the Baha'i International Community  pointed out that the government of Iran was no longer attempting to deny its harsh treatment of the Baha'is but was, instead,  seeking to justify it and also to deprive it of any religious significance. 

 The barrage of false charges levelled against the Baha'is by the government of fr6n was nothing more than a smokescreen designed to conceal the true reason for the persecution of the Baha'i community — the true reason being that the fundamentalist religious leaders in fr6n were not prepared to tolerate the existence of any religion that appeared after Ls16~m. 

The Baha International    
Community statement


<p424>
424                THE BAHA I WORLD

 went on to cite various compelling proofs that the persecution was motivated solely by religious prejudice and to rebut the baseless allegations made by the Iranian government against the Baha'is. It concluded by pointing out that the Iranian representative's claim that the Baha'i 

International Community   

 made no contribution to the work of the Commission was yet one more instance of an Iranian spokesman making baseless allegations against the Baha. The Baha'i 

International Community   

 had already made statements at the current session of the Commission concerning the Elimination of Racism, the Right to Development, and the Problem of Discrimination against Indigenous Peoples. 

 It had presented a written statement on the Rights of the Child and had submitted two sets of draft articles to the Working Group responsible for drawing up a Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 

Baha'i International      

 Community had been contributing actively and positively to the work of the United Nations in the social, cultural, economic and humanitarian fields for over thirty years. The presence of Baha representatives at the Commission on Human Rights was therefore neither unprecedented nor sinister. 

 Disregarding these comments, the representative  of I din once again attempted to convince delegates that thq Baha'i International Community had never contributed to the work of the Commission and was using it solely as a forum for launching 'groundless allegations' against the government of Irdn.. He claimed that those governments who had expressed their concern for the Baha in Iran were motivated by purely political considerations. 

 Shortly before the Commission, the Iranian government had indicated that it would be willing for a representative of the 

UN Secretary-General      

 to visit lrTh for the purpose of investigating the human fights situation there. This offer was confirmed on 31 January 1983 (the date on which the Commission began its 39th session) and the visit was scheduled to take place during the latter half of March (shortly after the Commission ended). The offer was widely regarded as a device whereby the government of fran hoped to persuade the Commission on Human Rights that it was not necessary for it to take action at its 39th session on the human rights situation in bAn. If the Commission failed to adopt a resolution on fr&n, the Secretary-General would no longer have a mandate to act on human rights violations in Inn and would be totally dependent  on the goodwill of the Iranian authorities. The Commission, however, failed to react as the Iranian government had hoped and a resolution was duly drafted. During the debate  on the resolution, the representative of IrAn threatened that its adoption would lead to the cancellation of the offer for a representative of the Secretary-General to visit 1dm. This threat made no impression on the Commission  and the resolution was adopted on 8 March 1983. 

 The resolution, supported by delegations from Africa, 

Asia, Central and North   

 America and Europe, expressed the Commission~ s profound concern' at the continuing grave violations of human rights in IThn, including the religious persecution of the Baha'is, urged the government of Iran to guarantee to all its citizens the fights recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and requested the Secretary-General to 'continue direct contacts with the government  of the Islamic Republic of IrAn on the grave human rights situation prevailing in that country, including the situation of the Baha is Responding to appeals on behalf of the Baha'is in ShirAz, the European 

Parliament, on 10 March   

 1983, adopted a resolution which called upon the government of fr6n to suspend  the death sentences of the twenty-two condemned Baha'is and requested the foreign ministers of the ten member states of the European Community to make urgent representations to the Iranian government 'in order to secure the release of these meffibers of the Baha religious community and a halt to all manner of persecution and discrimination to which the Baha'i minority in IrAn is '2 subject The plight of the Baha'is in fr&n was next considered by the United Nations Committee on the 

Elimination of Racial     

 Discrimination (CERD), a body of eighteen independent

 INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES

  experts charged with monitoring the progress made by States parties in complying with the provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of 

All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 

 The involvement of CERD in the Baha case arose from the fact that the iranian government, in its periodic report to the Committee, had claimed that the only minorities in I r~n were religious rather than racial and were all fully protected under the Constitution, and that the Baha'i International Community — aware of this misstatement  — had submitted to CERD a written report describing the true situation of the Baha'i minority in I din. In the course of their 18 March 1983 dialogue with representatives of the government of fr6n, the members of the Committee posed repeated questions concerning  the treatment of the Baha'is. After unsuccessfully challenging the Committee's competence to consider questions related to religion, the Iranian spokesman flatly denied that Baha'is were being persecuted in I r~n because of their religious beliefs and asserted that the Baha'i Faith was a subversive political organization. These and other misstateffients by the Iranian representative were duly corrected  in a memorandum subsequently circulated  by the Baha International Community to the members of CERD. 

  By Ridvan 1983, then, the persecution of the Baha'is in fran was firmly established on the human rights agenda of the 

United Nations. The Secretary-General

 and his senior human rights officials were actively involved in efforts to persuade the Iranian government to halt the persecution. Governments in every continent of the world had made the Iranian government aware of their abhorrence of its policies and of their profound concern for the Baha'is. The false and malicious charges made by the government of I r~n against the Baha Faith and its followers had been rejected out of hand by every human rights organ that had examined them.The persecution of the Baha'i Faith in the land of its birth was by now recognized throughout the globe as constituting the most blatant example of religious intolerance  in the contemporary world.

                                BAHA'U'LLAH


<p452>



<p453>
THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

             1. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE

             UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

                Declaration of Trust

  IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE ONE, THE INCOMPARABLE, THE ALL-POWERFUL, THE ALL-KNOWING, 

   THE ALL-WISE.

  The light that is shed from the heaven of bounty, and the benediction that shineth from the dawning-place of the will of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, rest upon Him Who is the Supreme Mediator, the Most Exalted Pen, Him Whom God hath made the dawning-place of His most excellent names and the dayspring of His most exalted attributes. Through Him the light of unity hat/i shone forth above the horizon of the world, and the law of oneness hath been revealed amidst the nations, who, with radiant faces, have turned towards the Supreme Horizon, and acknowledged that which ~he Tongue. of Utterance hat/i spoken in the kingdom of His knowledge: 'Earth and heaven, glory and dominion, are God's, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the Lord of grace abounding!' 

  ITH joyous and thankful hearts we testify to the abundance of God's Mercy, to the perfection  of His Justice and to the fulfilment of His Ancient 

Promise.                   
    Baha'u'llah, the Revealer 

 of God's Word in this Day, the Source of Authority, the Fountainhead  of Justice, the Creator of a new 

World Order, the Establisher

 of the Most Great Peace, the Inspirer and Founder of a world civilization, the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of all mankind, has proclaimed the advent of God's Kingdom on earth, has formulated its laws and ordinances, enunciated its principles, and ordained its institutions. To direct and canalize the forces released by His Revelation, He instituted His Covenant, whose power has preserved the integrity of His Faith, maintained its unity and stimulated its worldwide expansion throughout the successive ministries of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi. It continues to fulfil its life-giving purpose through the agency of the Universal House of Justice whose fundamental object, as one of the twin successors of Baha'u'llah  and 'Abdu'l-Baha, is to ensure the continuity of that divinely appointed authority which flows from the Source of the Faith, to safeguard the unity of its followers, and to maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teachings. 

 The fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion,declares Baha'u'llah,  is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. Suffer  it not to become a source of dissension and discord, of hate and enmity. This is the straight Path, the fixed and immovable foundation. Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure. 

 Unto the Most Holy Book, 'Abdu'l-Baha declares in His Will and Testament, every one must turn, and cill that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred to the Universal 

House of Justice.          

 The provenance, the authority, the duties, the sphere of action of the Universal House of Justice all derive from the revealed Word of Baha'u'llah which, together with the interpretations and expositions of the Centre of the 453


<p454>
454                 THE BAHA WORLD

  Covenant and of the Guardian of the Cause — who, after 'Abdu'l-Baha, is the sole authority in the interpretation of Baha'i Scripture  — constitute the binding terms of reference of the Universal House of Justice and are its bedrock foundation. The authority of these Texts is absolute and immutable until such time as Almighty God shall reveal His new Manifestation to Whom will belong all authority and power. 

 There being no successor to Shoghi Effendi as Guardian of the Cause of God, the Universal  House of Justice is the Head of the Faith and its supreme institution, to which all must turn, and on it rests the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the unity and progress of the Cause of God. Further, there devolve upon it the duties of directing and coordinating the work of the Hands of the Cause, of ensuring the continuing discharge of the functions of protection and propagation vested in that institution, and of providing for the receipt and disbursement of the Ijluq4qu'llAh. 

 Among the powers and duties with which the Universal House of Justice has been invested are: To ensure the preservation of the Sacred Texts and to safeguard their inviolability; to analyse, classify, and coordinate the Writings; and to defend and protect the Cause of God and emancipate it from the fetters of repression and persecution; To advance the interests of the Faith of God: to proclaim, propagate and teach its Message; to expand and--consolidate the institutions of its 

Administrative Order;

THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH    455

  those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly elect them. They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the dictates and promptings  of their conscience. They may, indeed they must, acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for themselves  the right of an unfettered decision. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth,is Baha'u'llah's incontrovertible assurance. 

 They, and not the body of those who either directly or indirectly elect them, have thus been made the recipients of the divine guidance which is at once the lifeblood  and ultimate safeguard of this Revelation.'

       The Universal House      

 of Justice was first elected on the first day, of the Festival of Ridvan in the one hundred and twentieth year of the Baha'i Era,1 when the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies, in accordance with the provisions of the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and in response to the summons  of the Hands of the Cause of God, the Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth, brought into being this 'crowning glory' of the administrative institutions  of Baha'u'llah, the very 'nucleus and forerunner' of His World Order. 

 Now, therefore,  in obedience to the Command of God and with entire reliance upon Him, we, the members  of the Universal House of Justice, set our hands and its seal to this Declaration of Trust which, together with the ByLaws hereto appended, form the Constitution of the Universal  House of Justice.

     This Administrative Order  

 is the nucleus and pattern of the World Order adumbrated by Baha'u'llah. In the course of its divinely propelled  organic growth its institutions will expand, putting forth auxiliary branches and developing subordinate agencies, multiplying their activities and diversifying their functions, in consonance with the principles and purposes revealed by Baha'u'llah for the progress of the human race.

           CONVENTION FOR THE ELECTION OF
           THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE
                     Ridvan 1983

  It is a time for rejoicing. The Sun of Baha'u'llah is mounting the heavens, bringing into ever clearer light the contrast between the gloom, the despair, the frustrations and bewilderment of the world, and the radiance, confidence, joy and certitude of His lovers. Lift up your hearts. The Day of God is here. 

  THESE concluding words of the Ridvan message of the Universal House of Justice to the Ba1A'is of the world were read by Abdu'l-Baha Rfihiyyih Kh6num when she opened the first consultative session of the fifth International Baha'i Convention on Saturday, 30 April1983. 

 Simultaneously translated into Spanish and French though headphones which had been made available to the delegates, the message infused the deliberations with an observable tone of optimism. 

 The initial session was held the previous day at 9:00 a.m. on Friday, 29 April, in the permanent Seat of the Universal 

House of Justice. The      

 reception concourse was filled to capacity with five hundred and ninety delegates from one hundred and nineteen National Spiritual Assemblies. Also present were eight Hands of the Cause of God —  Abdu'l-Baha Rahiyyih KMnum, Dr. Ugo Giachery, 'Ali-Akbar Funitan Dhikru'llAh Kh6dem, Dr. 'All-Muhammad VarqA, 

Wil-ham  Sears, John Robarts

 and Collis Feather-stone  — the members of the Universal House of Justice, and fifty-seven Counsellors including  the four Counsellor members of the International Teaching Centre. A temporary dais had been constructed at the base of the lower steps of the main staircase to accommodate  the balloting procedure. An enormous urn filled with hundreds of red and white spring flowers graced the dais. 

 The programme  for the day provided for the election of the Universal House of Justice, the taking of the official Convention photograph and the celebration of the Ninth Day of Ridvan. 

 In the evening there was screened an audiovisual presentation on the progress of the 

Seven Year Plan.           

 The Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha RiP hiyyih Kh6num presided, opening the session with a newly-translated prayer of 'Abdu'l-Baha's which had been distributed throughout the Baha'i world in order that it might be recited on 28 April on behalf of the Iranian believers in special gatherings held in all 1 communities. 

 After additional prayers in French, Spanish and Persian had been read or chanted, delegates representing one hundred and thirty-three  National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 participated,  either in person or by mail, in electing the nine members of the Universal House of Justice who will serve for the next five years. The members elected were: Mr. 'AU Na1~ja-vAni, Mr. Hushmand Fatheazam, Mr. Jan Semple, Dr. David S. Ruhe, Mr. Glenford Mitchell, Mr. David I{ofman, Mr. Borrah Kavelin, Mr. Charles Wolcott and Mr. Hugh F. 

Chance.                    

 Powerful emotions stirred the believers when the name of the National Spiritual Assembly of fnin was announced. The entire assemblage arose as one body and stood with dignity and reverence while the first Chief Teller, Judge Dorothy Nelson, called out the names of the members of the Spiritual Assembly  of I r~in and the ballots which they had mailed were cast. 

 All remained standing for a further minute of silent tribute. The National Spiritual Assembly of fran had sent one hundred and thirty-three red roses as its gift to its sister National Assemblies, and one rose was presented to each delegation as they left the dais.

The subjects discussed during these general meetings included ways and means to acquaint governments, media, leaders of thought and the general public with the aims and purposes of the Faith; the need to assist and stimulate the Baha'is to attain new and higher Levels of spiritual understanding and devotion; the growing importance of expansion, consolidation and proclamation of the Faith through a greater variety and a Larger volume of Baha'i Literature, and a wider and more effective use of the media, particularly of radio, in broadcasting the divine message; what the institutions of the Cause can do to assist and encourage the development of the economic and social life of the countries of the third world despite the limited resources of the Baha'i community; and identifying  the challenging needs and opportunities of the Faith during the remaining and concluding years of the century. 

 In addition to the plenary sessions more than one hundred consultative sessions were held in the evening hours between and among delegations that share common problems and interests. These gatherings sometimes lasted until past 11:00 p.m. and involved as many as six or seven national delegations. 

 One evening was devoted to continental meetings, each of the five separate sessions being chaired by a member of the Continental 

Board of Counsellors.      

 The opening days of the delegates' stay in Haifa, 26 — 28 April, were devoted to visits to the Holy Places in 'Akka and Haifa and included  the first-ever visits to the restored house of 'Abdu'lhih Pashi where the first pilgrims from the West were received by 'Abdu'l-Baha. The delegates displayed re spect and appreciation for the meticulous work of restoration and admiration for the scrupulously faithful furnishing which had been accomplished under the careful supervision  of 

Amatu'I-Bahfi Riihiyyih    

 KlThnum. A highlight of the three days was a tour of the magnificent new Seat of the Universal House of Justice which stood in the full splendour of the spring gardens covering the Baha'i properties on Mount Carmel. The Shrine of the BTh, the Seat of the House of Justice, the International Archives building and the Monuments of the Holy Family were each illuminated by night and stood in beautiful contrast against the dark mountain. 

 Two J-Toiy Days were observed during the Convention period. The Ninth Day of Ridvan was celebrated in the courtyard and gardens of the Pilgrim House in the vicinity of the Shrine of the BTh, and the Twelfth Day of Ridvan in the Haram-i-Aqdas at Baha where Baha'u'llah is entombed. Prayers and chants uttered in nine languages included heartfelt supplications on behalf of the suffering Baha of fran. On each of the two Holy Days more than nine hundred Baha'is circumambulated the Holy Tombs after the respective Tablets of Visitation had been read. 

 A moving moment occurred at the opening of the observance of the Ninth Day of Ridvan when a special message from His Highness Malietoa Tanumafihi II, dated 6 April 1983, was read by Abdu'l-Baha R6hiyyih 

KM-mim:                    

  'Precious Members of the Universal House of Justice, Beloved Hands of the Cause, Respected Counsellors, Esteemed Delegates attending the 5th International 

Baha'i Convention  —  'My   

 dear spiritual Brothers and Sisters, 'While our hearts turn with sorrow and grief to the events engulfing our fellow believers in the cradle of the Faith and witness with profound admiration their exemplary steadfastness and spiritual strength, our grateful hearts turn to Baha'u'llah in thanksgiving for the many victories that have come to the Baha'i World. 

  'The completion of the magnificent permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice, the simultaneous rising of the two Houses of Worship in Asia and the Pacific,

  the unprecedented support and recognition of the Cause by many distinguished leaders of Governments, are but a few historic milestones our generation has been fortunate to witness. 

 'A new momentum, a new spirit is felt in this part of the world. 

 In Samoa we witness a new surge of enthusiasm, activity and devotion by the believers and recognition and respect by the friends of our precious Faith. Our grateful appreciation goes to the Universal House of Justice who chose this small nation to be the recipient of that wonderful gift — the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Pacific. We are equally gratified by the support of the friends of God all over the world, even the smallest and remotest villages in all continents, that are giving for the completion of this enterprise. 

 ~May this historic convention be a source of joy and solace to your hearts. 

 Our most sincere prayers and good wishes are with you during the course of your deliberations.' 

 Through the spontaneous and devoted efforts of two members of the World Centre staff, the Hands of the Cause and the Counsellors received the gift of a cassette recording of the address of Abdu'l-Baha Riil3iyyih Khfinum which opened, and that of William Sears which closed, the pknary sessions, and were thus able to share with the National Conventions they were scheduled to attend a remembrance from the Holy Land. 

 The address of Mr. Sears was also made available to all National Assemblies in Africa. 

 The Hands of the Cause, with the exception of Mr. Sears who returned to Canada after addressing the closing session of the Convention, remained in Haifa for another five days to consult with the fifty-three visiting members  of the Continental Boards of Counsellors and the 

International Teaching   

 Centre. The members of the House of Justice participated in the consultations. On the final day the House of Justice entertained the visitors at a farewell luncheon at Mazra'ih. 

  Friends gathered at Pilgrim House, Haifa, for the observance during the International Convention, 1983, of the Ninth Day of Ridvan. Seen seated is Abdu'l-Baha R4h(yyih Khdnum; standing, the

   3. THE COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION
   OF THE BUILDING FOR THE SEAT OF THE
             UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

 Call out to Zion, 0 Carmel, and announce the loyful tidings: He that was hidden from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing ing splendour is revealed. Beware lest thou hesitate or halt. Verily this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement, the Day for which have been laid up those things which God, through a bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for revelation. Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Baha who have been mentioned in the Book of Names. 

                                Baha'u'llah, Tablet of Carmel

  ON 5 June 1975 the Universal House of Justice announced to all National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world that 'it is now both necessary and possible to initiate construction of a building that will not only serve the practical needs of a steadily consolidating administrative centre but will, for centuries to come, stand as a visible expression of the majesty of the divinely ordained institutions of the Administrative Order of Baha'u'llah'. The building, the House of Justice explained, would be faced 'with stone from Italy, and surrounded by a stately colonnade of Corinthian columns'. It would contain, in addition to the council chamber of the House of Justice, 'a library, a concourse for the reception of pilgrims and dignitaries, storage vaults with air-purification for the preservation of original Tablets and other precious documents, accommodation for the secretariat and the many ancillary services that will be required'. The design, classically beautiful and majestic, was that of Mr. Husayn Amdnat whose appointment as architect was announced on 18 September 1973. 

 On 10 January 1977 the House of Justice announced that an agreement had been signed with a general contractor for the erection of the building. 'The erection of this building which, comprising five and a half storeys,' the House of Justice wrote, 'far surpasses in size and complexity any building at present in existence at the World Centre, presents a major challenge to the Baha'i community, whose resources are already too meagre in relation to the great tasks that lie before it. But the spirit of sacrifice has been the hallmark of the followers of Baha'u'llah of every race and clime and as they unite to raise this second1 of the great edifices of the Administrative Centre of their Faith they will rejoice at having the inestimable privilege of taking part in a "vast and irresistible process" which Shoghi Effendi stated is "unexampled in the spiritual history of mankind" and which will "attain its final consummation, in the Golden Age of the Faith, through the raising of the standard of the Most Great Peace, and the emergence, in the plenitude of its power and glory, of the focal Centre of the agencies constituting the World Order of Baha'u'llah".' 

 Excavation of the site on the slopes of Mount Carmel began on 17 June 1975 and construction proceeded without interruption. On 29 April 1978, assisted by the architect and Mr. 'Aziz Khabfpiir, the resident construction engineer, the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Riihfyyih Kh6num, during the fourth International Convention, placed a casket containing Dust from the Holy Shrines of the Faith in a niche above the front entrance of the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, in the outer wall of the council chamber. 

 Despite the outbreak of the persecution of the Baha'i community in the cradle of the Faith and the instigation of repressive measures which resulted in virtually crippling the capacity of the believers in Ir6n to make financial contributions, heroic compensatory sacrifices were made by the followers of Baha'u'llah in every land which enabled the construction of the edifice — the greatest single undertaking of the Five Year Plan — to proceed without halt, and by Ridvan 1983 all was in readiness for the fifth International Convention. 

 The first of the majestic the Faith which was completed edifices constituting     in the summer of 1957 (Universal this mighty Centre, was   House of Justice).

THE HANDS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD

        1. THE HANDS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD AND
       THE EXTENSION OF THEIR FUNCTIONS INTO
                     THE FUTURE
           A. THE RULERS AND THE LEARNED

  IN every society and community of human beings there are those who are revered for their learning and wisdom, and there are those who are invested with authority to govern. 

 In relig-jous  communities it has been usual for the legislative  and governing authority to be held by the learned who have thus, as priests or as doctors of religious law, combined both capacities in the same persons. Other communities have, oniy too often, been riven by the conflict between church and state, between priests and kings, or, in more modern terms, between intellectuals and the establishment. 

 In the World Order of Baha'u'llah these two extremes, of the over-concentration of authority  on the one hand and of division and conflict on the other, are eliminated. The way this is achieved is one of the unique features of that Order and confers unimagined benefits upon the Baha'i community. 

 In the Kitcib-i-'Ahd       
(The Book of the Covenant) 

Baha'u'llah wrote, Blessed

 are the rulers and the learned in Baha. The Guardian, interpreting this passage, stated on 4 November 1931: In this holy cycle the 'learned' are, on the one hand the Hands of the Cause of God, and, on the other, the teachers and diffusers of His teachings who do not rank as Hands, but who have bttained an eminent position in the teaching work. 

 As to the 'rulers' they refer to the members of the 

Local, National and International
Houses of Justice. The     

 duties of each of these souls will be determined in the future. (Trans-lated from the Persian.) 

  Since those words were written the Baha'i Administrative Order has developed rapidly and is now functioning throughout the world. Under the supreme authority, of the revealed Law of God the Baha'i community is governed by its elected institutions: Local and 

National                   

 Spiritual Assemblies and the Universal House of Justice, while the institutions of the 'learned', which exercise no governing authority  over the believers, are accorded an exalted rank which enables them to exert their beneficent influence over all parts of the community. Commenting on this feature of the 

Baha'i Administrative     
Order, the Universal       

 House of Justice wrote in its message of 24 

April 1972:                

  The existence of institutions of such exalted rank, comprising individuals who play such a vital role, who yet have no legislative, administrative or judicial authority, and are entirely devoid of priestly functions or the right to make authoritative interpreta-dons, is a feature of Baha'i administration unparalleled in the religions of the past Developing this theme, the Universal House of Justice referred in that same message to a letter written on behalf of the Guardian on 14 March 1927, to the Spiritual Assembly of Istanbul, in which he expounded the Baha'i principle of action by majority vote. In this letter Shoghi Effendi points out how, in the past, it was certain individuals who 'accounted themselves as superior in knowledge and elevated in position'  who caused division, and that it was those 'who pretended to be the most distinguished of all' who 'always proved themselves t6 be the source of contention'. He praises 

God that Baha'u'llah      

 had withdrawn authority from 'the unyielding and dictatorial views of the learned and the wise', rejected the assertions of individuals,  even though recognized as the most accomplished and learned among men, as authoritative criteria, and 'ordained that all matters be referred to authorized centres and assemblies'. 

 Thus the institutions of the learned in the Baki'f Faith, while invested with high rank and exercising invaluable moral authority and influence, have no executive 473


<p474>
474                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  power other than in the direction of their own institutions. 

 The difficulty of establishing a clear understanding of this administrative concept, new in the history of religion, is reflected in the concluding  passage of the message of the Universal  House of Justice, of 24 April 1972, quoted above: The newness and uniqueness of this concept make it difficult to grasp; only as the Baha'i community grows and the believers are increasingly able to contemplate its administrative structure uninfluenced by concepts from past ages, will the vital interdependence of the 'rulers' and 'learned' in the Faith be properly understood, and the inestimable value of their interaction be fully recognised. 

  Only now, as these two arms of the world-embracing system of Baha'u'llah begin to function  in their separate but complementary roles towards a common achievement, are intimations caught of the divine beneficence of that system. 
                           
          B. THE HANDS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD

  Baha'u'llah Himself created the institution of the Hands of the Cause and appointed a few of His followers to serve Him as Hands in His own lifetime. 

 In the Tablet of the World He refers to the Hands of the Cause in words descriptive of the station of service to which they are called: Light and glory, greeting and praise be upon the Hands of His Cause through whom the light of fortitude hat/i shone forth and the truth hath been established that the authority to choose rests with God, the Powerful, the Miglity, the Unconstrained, through whom the ocean of bounty hath surged and the fragrance of the gtacious favours of God, the Lord of mankind, hath been diffused. We beseech Him  — Exalted is He  — jo shield them through the power of His hosts, to protect them through the potency of His dominion and to aid them through His indomitable  strength which prevaileth over all created things. Sovereignty is God's, the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of the Kingdom of 

Names.                     
                           
    The Will and Testament     

 of 'Abdu'l-Baha contains many references to the Hands of the Cause, including explicit definitions of their station and functions, as well as various admonitions addressed to them: Salutation and praise, blessing and glory rest.. 

 upon the Hands of the Cause of God that have diffused widely the Divine Fragrances, declared His Proofs, proclaimed His Faith, published abroad His Law, detached themselves from all things but Him, stood for righteousness in this worId~ and kindled the Fire of the Love of God in the very hearts and souls of His ~ervants;... 

 the Hands of the Cause of God must be ever watchful and so soon as they find anyone beginning  to oppose and protest against the Guardian of the Caisse of God cast him out from the congregation of the people of Ba/id and in no wise accept any excuse from him... 

 •The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in the work of the Guardian of the Cause of God. The election of these nine must be carried either unanimously or by majority from the company 0/the Hands of the Cause of God and these, whether unanimously or by a majority vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the Guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor. 

 o friends! The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed by the Guardian of the Cause of God. All must be under his shadow and obey his command. 

 The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the character of all men and to be, at all times and under all conditions,  sanctified and detached from earthly things. They must manifest the fear of God by their conduct, their manners, their deeds and their words. This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the Guardian of the Cause of God. He must continually urge them to strive and endeavour to the utmost of their ability to diffuse the sweet savours of God, and to guide all the peoples of the world, for it is the light of Divine. Guidance that causeth all the universe to be illumined. To disregard; though it be for a moment, this absolute command which is binding upon everyone, is in no wise permitted, that the surface of the earth may become heavenly, that contention and conflict amidst peoples, kindreds, nations and governments may disappear, that all the dwellers on earth may become one people and one race, that the world may become even as one home. 

  'Abdu'l-Baha did not Himself appoint any additional Hands of the Cause. He did, however,  refer to certain outstanding teachers of the Faith as Hands. 

 During the first three decades of his ministry as Guardian of the Faith, 

Shoghi Effendi


<p475>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA' U' LLAH   475

  designated certain outstanding Baha'is as Hands posthumously. 

 Then, in December 1951, he raised twelve living believers to this exalted rank, a development of the Administrative  Order which thrilled the entire 

Baha'i world. In February  

 1952 he appointed a further seven, and in 1957 eight more, bringing the total number to twenty-seven.' 

 In these brief six years the Guardian not only established  this institution on a firm foundation throughout the world, with a body of four Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land to act as the liaison between himself and the Hands in each continent, but he brought into being in each continent two Auxiliary Boards, one for the protection and one for the propaga don of the Faith, to act as the 'assistants, deputies and advisers' of the Hands of that continent. 

 The epic story of how in November 1957, the Hands of the Cause of God, called by the Guardian the 'Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth', rallied the grief-stricken and stunned Baha'is of the world, guided them to the victorious accomplishment of the Ten Year Crusade which he had launched, and convened the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies for the first election of the Universal House of Justice in April 1963, has been told in befitling detail in Volume XIII of this publication. 
                           
            C. THE CONTINENTAL BOARDS OF
                     COUNSELLORS
     The establishment of the   

Universal House of Justice 

 in 1963 ushered in a new phase in the evolution of the institution of the Hands of the Cause. 

In October 1963 the House  

 of Justice decided 'that there is no way to appoint or legislate to make it possible to appoint a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi'. Therefore, among the first questions which it was necessary for it then to consider were the manner  in which the institution of the Hands of the Cause was to continue to perform its appointed functions, the relationship which should exist between the House of Justice and the Hands of the Cause, and how the indispensable functions  of the Hands of the Cause could be extended into the future, since, according to the text of the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed by the Guardian of the 

Cause of God.              

 Following consultation with a conclave of the 

Hands in October — November  
1964, the Universal House  

 of Justice announced to the believers in its message of November 1964 the following decisions: There is no way to appoint, or to legislate to make it possible to appoint, Hands of the Cause of 

God.                       

  Responsibility for decisions on matters of general policy affecting the institution of the Hands of the Cause, which was formerly exercised by the beloved Guardian, now devolves upon the Universal House 

1 See 'The Institution     

 of the Hands of the Cause of God', The Ba/nYf World, vol. XIII, p. 334. 

 of Justice as the supreme and central institution of the Faith to which all must turn. 

  That same message announced increases in the number of the members of the Auxiliary Boards for propagation in every continent, and the Hands were requested to appoint one or more members of each Auxiliary Board to act in an executive capacity on their behalf and in the name of each Hand, for the direction of the work of the Boards. 

 The message continued: The exalted rank and specific functions of the Hands of the Cause of God make it inappropriate for them to be elected or appointed to administrative institutions, or to be elected as delegates to national conventions. 

 Furthermore, it is their desire and the desire of the House of Justice that they be free to devote their entire energies to the vitally important duties conferred upon them in the Holy Writings. 

  At the same time the House of Justice confirmed the request of the Hands of the Cause that, henceforth, members of the Auxiliary Boards should be freed from administrative  responsibilities, including service on committees and as delegates to conventions. 

  On 21 June 1968 the House  

 of Jusfice announced by cable to the Baha'i world the decision to establish eleven Continental Boards of Counsellors for the protection and propagation of the Faith and, in a written message  issued on 24 June, outlined in detail the nature and scope of this action. Because of its great significance to the evolution of the Administrative Order, the entire text of this message is quoted:


<p476>
476

                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The majestic unfoldment of Baha'u'llah's world-redeeming administrative system has been marked by the successive establishment of the various institutions and agencies which constitute the framework of that divinely-created Order. 

 Thus, more than a quarter-of-a-century after the emergence of the first National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha'i world the institution of the Hands of the Cause of God was formally established, with the appointment by the beloved Guardian, in conformity with the provisions of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament, of the first contingent of these high-ranking officers of the Faith. Following the passing of the Guardian of the Cause of God, it fell to the House of Justice to devise a way, within the Administrative Order, of developing 'the institution of the Hands of the Cause with a view to extension into the future of its appointed functions of protection and propagation', and this was made a goal of the Nine Year Plan. Much thought and study has been given to the question over the past four years, and the texts have been collected and reviewed. 

 During the last two months, this goal, as announced in our cable to the National Conventions, has been the object of prolonged and prayerful consultation between the Universal House of Justice and the Hands of the Cause of God. All this made evident the framework within which this goal was to be achieved, namely: The Universal House of Justice sees no way in which additional Ha~nds of the Cause of God can be appointed. 

  The absence of the Guardian of the Faith brought about an entirely new relationship between the Universal House of Justice and the Hands of the Cause and called for the progressive unfoldment by the Universal House of Justice of the manner in which the Hands of the Cause would carry out their divinely-conferred functions of protection and propagation. 

  Whatever new development or institution is initiated should come into operation as soon as possible  in order to reinforce and supplement the work of the Hands of the Cause while at the same time taking full advantage of the opportunity of having the Hands themselves assist in launching and guiding the new procedures. 

  Any such institution must grow and operate in harmony with the principles governing the functioning  of the institution of the Hands of the Cause of God. 

  In the light of these considerations the Universal House of Justice decided, as announced in its recent cable, to establish Continental 

Boards of Counsellors     

 for the protection and propagation of the Faith. Their duties will include directing the Auxiliary Boards in their respective areas, consulting and col laborating with National Spiritual Assemblies, and keeping the Hands of the Cause and the 

Universal House of Justice 

 informed concerning the conditions of the Cause in their areas. 

        Initially eleven Boards    

 of Counsellors have been appointed, one for each of the following areas: 

NoTthwestern Africa, Central
and East Africa,           

Southern Africa, North     
America, Central America,  

South America, Western     
Asia, Southeastern Asia,   

Northeastern Asia, Australasia
and Europe.                

 The members of these Boards of Counsellors will serve for a term, or terms, the kngth of which will be determined and announced at a later date, and while serving in this capacity, will not be eligible for membership on national or local administrative bodies. One member of each Continental 

Board of Counsellors      

 has been designated as Trustee of the Continental Fund for its area. 

 The Auxiliary Boards for protection and propagation will henceforth report to the Continental Boards of Counsellors who will appoint or replace members of the Auxiliary Boards as circumstances may require. 

 Such appointments and replacements as may be necessary in the initial stages will take place after consultation with the Hand or Hands previously assigned to the continent or zone. 

 The Hands of the Cause of God have the prerogative and obligation to consult with the Continental Boards of Counsellors and National Spiritual Assemblies on any subject which, in their view, affects the interests of the Cause. 

 The Hands residing in the Holy Land will act as liaison between the Universal House of Justice and the Continental Boards of Counsellors, and will also assist the Universal House of Justice in setting up, at a propitious time, an international teaching centre in the Holy Land, as anticipated in the Guardian's writings. 

 The Hands of the Cause of God are one of the most precious assets the Baha'i world possesses. Released from administration of the Auxiliary Boards, they will be able to concentrate their energies on the more primary responsibilities of general protection and propagation, 'preservation of the spiritual health of the Baha'i communities' and 'the vitality of the faith' of the Baha'is throughout the world. 

The House of Justice       

 will call upon them to undertake special missions on its behalf, to represent it on both Baha'i and other occasions and to keep it informed of the welfare of the Cause. While the Hands of the Cause will, naturally, have special concern for the affairs of the Cause in the areas in which they reside, they will operate increasingly on an intercontinental level, a factor which will lend tremendous impetus to the diffusion throughout the Baha'i world of the spiritual inspiration channelled through them — the Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic 

World Commonwealth.        

 With joyful hearts we proclaim this further


<p477>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH     477

  unfoldment of the Administrative Order of Baha'u'llah  and join our prayers to those of the friends throughout the East and the West that Baha'u'llah may continue to shower his confirmations upon the efforts of His servants in the safeguarding and promotion  of His 

Faith.                     

  A .clarification of the status of Counsellors and their relationship to 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 was made by the House of Justice in a letter to a National Spiritual 

Assembly in May 1975:      

  ...     (it) must be one of warm and active collaboration, a full sharing in the excitement and the challenge of the teaching work and the establishment of living and growing 

Baha'i communities. While  

 the role of the Counsellors is normally to advise, encourage  and reinforce, and they have no legislative or administrative authority, they nevertheless occupy a rank superior to that of the National Assembly or its members and each individual Counsellor is a high officer of the Faith entitled to the respect, honour and courtesy due to his rank. Each country which is privileged to have a resident Counsellor should prize that privilege. 

Each National Assembly     

 which has a Counsellor at hand for frequent consultations should, without relinquishing any portion of its divinely assigned authority, call upon him often for his views and accord great weight to his advice. 

  On 8 June 1973 a further directive was sent to the Continental Boards of Counsellors which answered the need discussed by the Counsellors during their sessions in the Holy Land, at the time of the International Convention  of that year, for some method to enable their institution to reach more deeply into the fabric of the Baha'i world community. 

 The House of Justice authorized each Board of Counsellors, at its discretion, to permit Auxil iary Board members to appoint assistants, whose duties would be to activate and encourage  Local Spiritual Assemblies, to call the attention of Local Spiritual Assembly members  to the importance of regular meetings, to encourage local communities to gather for Nineteen Day Feasts and Holy Days, to help deepen their fellow-believers' understanding of the teachings, and generally to assist the Auxiliary Board members in the discharge of their duties. The advice, at that time, was to proceed gradually with this new step so that experience could indicate the most .effective manner of its operation. Since then, as a result of the proven value of this expanded service, appointments of assistants in each zone have been steadily and rapidly augmented. 

 The letter  of 8 June 1973 stated that 'believers can serve at the same time both as assistants to Auxiliary Board members and on administrative institutions'. 

 Adjustments to the number of Continental Boards of Counsellors are made as the Universal  House of Justice deems necessary, entailing adjustments to zones assigned to the Boards, to the number of Counsellors and to the numbers of Auxiliary 

Boards and Auxiliary       

 Board members.1 Thus the institution operates at all levels throughout the world, reaching into the basic structure of local community life and. exerting its encouraging and uplifting influence upon the lives of individuals and the deliberations of institutions, constantly watching over the security of the Faith, pointing the way to the promotion of its best interests, and to the ever wider dissemination of its healing message. 
                           
            D. THE INTERNATIONAL TEACHING
                       CENTRE

  Assurance of the extension into the future of the appointed functions of protection and propagation conferred upon the Hands of the Cause was accomplished by the establishment of the Continental Boards of Counsellors. However, that vital goal having been accomplished,  the problem remained of ordering the work of the new institution so that it would grow organically with the Faith itself. 

 In a letter addressed to all National Spiritual Assemblies on 24 June 1968 the 

 Universal House of Justice

 confirmed that 'the relationship ship of Continental Boards of Counsellors to National 

 Spiritual Assemblies      

 will follow the pattern of the relationship between the Hands of the Cause and National Spiritual Assemblies, outlined by the beloved Guardian in various communications'. 

 The cablegram addressed by the Universal House of Justice to all National 

 Spiritual 1 In November   

 1980 the thirteen Boards of Counsellors were consolidated into five, each Continental Board having two Auxiliary Boards, one for protection and one for propagation; and each Auxiliary Board member having assistants as needed and authorized.

Assemblies on 21 June     

 1968 announcing the establishment of Continental Boards of Counsellors  had contained a reference to the 'future establishment international teaching centre Holy Land foreshadowed writings beloved Guardian.' 

    In October 1971 the Hands 

 of the Cause were notified that after the International Convention  for the election of the Universal House of 

Justice during Ridvan     

 1973, their presence in the Holy Land for a period of time in order to consult on a number of important subjects would be most welcome. The foremost topic would be the establishment of the international teaching centre about which the Hands had previously been requested to submit their written  views. The Universal House of Justice, in its letter to the Hands of the Cause in October 1971, cited, amongst others, the following three quotations from the Guardian which anticipated  the evolution of the World Administrative Centre of the Faith on Mount Carmel and the establishment there of an international teaching centre as the seat of the Hands of the Cause of God: •    it must be clearly understood, nor can it be sufficiently emphasized, that the conjunction of the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother incalculably reinforces the spiritual potencies of that consecrated Spot which, under the wings of the B~b's overshadowing Sepulchre,  and in the vicinity of the future Mashriqu'l-Adhkar,  which will be reared on its flank, is destined to evolve into the focal centre of those world-shaking, world-embracing, world-directing administrative  institutions, ordained by Baha'u'llah and anticipated by 'Abdu'l-Baha and which are to function in consonance with the principles that govern the twin institutions of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. Then, and then only, will this momentous prophecy which illuminates the concluding  passages of the Tablet of Carmel be fulfilled: Ere long will God sad His Ark upon thee (Carmel) and will manifest the people of RaM who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.' 

 In this great Tablet which unveils divine mysteries and heralds the establishment of two mighty, majestic and momentous undertakings — one of which is spiritual and the other administrative, both at the World Centre of the Faith — Baha'u'llah refers to an 'Ark', whose dwellers are the men of the Supreme House of Justice, which, in conformity with the exact 'Shoghi Effendi, letter to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 

States, 21 December 1939; 

 see Messages to America, pp. 32 — 33. 

 provisions of the Will and Testament of the Centre of the Mighty Covenant is the body which should lay down laws not explicitly revealed in the Text. 

 In this Dispensation, these laws are destined to flow from this holy mountain, even as in the Mosaic Dispensation the law of God was promulgated from Zion. The 'sailing of the Ark' of His laws is a reference to the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, which is indeed the Seat of Legislation, one of the branches of the World Administrative Centre of the Baha'is on this holy mountain. 

 It will be housed in a separate building near the International Archives building, now under construction, on a site in the neighbourhood of the Shrine of the Bab, and overlooking the sacred and illumined Monuments. In the neighbourhood of these two stately edifices and two mighty Institutions (i.e. the Archives Building and the edifice for the House of Justice), another edifice will gradually be erected which will be the Seat of the Guardianship, the Centre which will interpret, expound and prepare commentaries on explicitly revealed laws, and will reinforce and supplement the legislative body. Yet another edifice to supplement these three edifices will be the Centre for the propagation and teaching of the Faith, the Seat for the Hands of the Cause, who, in accordance with the explicit text of the Will and Testament are charged with the security, the preservation and protection of the Cause, the safeguarding of the unity of the corn-munitj4 the promotion of God's religion and the spread of His Word. These majestic and mighty edifices, which will be constructed gradually in accordance with a beautiful and unique style of architecture around the sacred Monuments, are all considered as branches of this highly-exalted, firmly-grounded and broadly-based World 

Administrative  Centre   

 of the followers of the Cause of Him Who is the Lord of this Age and the Ruler of Creation.2 
       The raising of this edifice

(International Baha'i Archives)

 will in turn herald the construction, in the course of successive epochs of the Formative Age of the Faith, of several other structures, which will serve as the administrative seats of such divinely appointed institutions as the Guardianship, the Hands of the Cause, and the Universal House of Justice. These edifices will, in the shape of a far-flung arc, and following a harmonizing style of architecture, surround the resting places of the Greatest Holy Leaf, ranking as foremost among the members of her sex in the Baha'i Dispensation, of her brother, offered up as a ransom by Baha'u'llah for the quickening of the world and its unification, and of their mother, proclaimed  by Him to be His chosen 'consort in all the worlds of God'. 

 The ultimate completion of this stupendous undertaking will mark the culmination of 2 Shoghi Effendi, letter in Persian to the Baha'is of the East, Naw-Rjiz 111 (1954).

Faith.1                   

  On 5 June 1973, following the International Convention and the consultations with the Hands of the Cause, and less than a month after the Counsellors had left the Holy Land to reSume their services within their zones, the following announcement was cabled by the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual

  It was followed three days later by this expanded announcement to the Baha'is of the world: The centennial year of the revelation of the Kitdb-i-A  qdas has already witnessed events of such capital significance in the annals of the Baha Dispensation as to cause us to contemplate with awe the rapidity with which Divine Providence is advancing the Cause of the Most Great Name. 

 The time is indeed propitious for the establishment of the International Teaching Centre, a development which, at one and the same time, brings to fruition the work of the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land and provides for its extension into the future, links the institution of the Boards of Counsellors even more intimately with that of the Hands of the Cause of God, and powerfully reinforces the discharge of the rapidly growing responsibilities of the Universal House of Justice. 

    This International Teaching

 Centre now established will, in due course, operate from that building designated by the Guardian as the Seat for the Hands Shoghi Effendi, letter to the Baha'is of the world, 27 November 1954; see Messages to the Baha'( World, p. 74. 

 of the Cause, which must be raised on the arc on Mount Carmel in close proximity to the Seat of the Universal House of Justice. 

 The duties now assigned to this nascent institution are: To coordinate, stimulate and direct the activities of the Continental Boards of Counsellors and to act as liaison between them and the Universal House of Justice. 

  To be fully informed of the situation of the Cause in all parts of the world and to be able, from the background of this knowledge, to make reports and recommendations to the Universal House of Justice and give advice to the Continental Boards of 

Counsellors.              

  To be alert to possibilities, both within and without the Baha'i community, for the extension of the teaching work into receptive or needy areas, and to draw the attention of the 

Universal House of Justice

 and the Continental Boards of Counsellors to such possibilities, making recommendations for action. 

  To determine and anticipate needs for literature, pioneers and travelling teachers and to work out teaching plans, both regional and global, for the approval of the Universal House of Justice. 

  All the Hands of the Cause of God will be members of the International 

Teaching Centre. Each Hand

 will be kept regularly informed of the activities of the Centre through reports or copies of its minutes, and will be able, wherever he may be residing  or travelling, to convey suggestions, recommendations and information to the Centre and, whenever he is in the Holy Land, to take part in the consultations and other activities of the Centre. 

 In addition, we now appoint Mr. Hooper Dunbar, Mrs. Florence Mayberry and Mr. 'Aziz Yazdf to membership of the International Teaching Centre, with the rank of Counsellor. 

 These believers, who have been serving with distinction on the Continental  Boards of Counsellors in South 

America, North America    

 and Central and East Africa respectively, will henceforth reside in Haifa and will, together with the Hands present in the Holy Land, constitute the nucleus of the operations of the Centre. 

 Authority for the expulsion and reinstatement of Covenant-breakers remains with the Hands of the Cause of God. Al] 

 such matters will be investigated locally by the relative Continental 

Board of Counsellors     

 in consultation with any Hand or Hands who may be in the area. The Continental 

Board of Counsellors     

 and the Hands concerned will then make their reports to the International Teaching Centre where they will be considered. The decision whether or not to expel or reinstate will be made by the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land who will, as at


<p480>
480                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  present, submit their decision to the Universal House of Justice for approval. 

 The decisions now announced are the outcome of deliberation extending over a number of years, reinforced by consultations with the Hands of the Cause of God, and especially with the Hands residing in the Holy Land who were requested in 1968 to assist the Universal House of Justice in the establishment of the International Teaching Centre, a task that now increases in magnitude as that Centre begins its work. 

 One of the first tasks assigned by the Universal House of Justice to the 

International Teaching    

 Centre was to devise the broad outlines of the global teaching plan to begin at Rhjv6n 1974 and conclude five years later at Ridvan 1979. This comprehensive and detailed survey of the entire Baha'i world community provided an opportunity for the Teaching Centre to become thoroughly acquainted with the conditions, needs and potentialities of the one hundred and thirteen national Baha'i communities  which made up the Baha'i international community at RidvTh 1973. 

 A greatly increased flow of vital information from the Continental Boards of Counsellors was called for by the International Teaching Centre, which promised, in turn, the development of an increasingly close relationship between itself and the Boards through a similarly increased flow of materials from the 

Teaching Centre. At        

 the request of the House of Justice the Teaching Centre also evolved a plan for international collaboration on travelling teaching projects. 

 The divinely ordained institution of the Hands of the Cause of God, having been brought into active reality by the Guardian of the Faith according to the directives of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament, was confronted in its infancy with an appalling crisis in the Life of that Faith whose protection was its prime duty. During the interregnum between the passing of the Guardian and the election of the Universal House of Justice, the Hands of the Cause as its Chief Stewards, maintained the integrity and unity of the Faith. The functions of protection and propagation appoinfed to this great institution have now been extended into the future in a manner consonant with the principles of the Faith. The Continental Boards of Counsellors with their attendant Auxiliary Boards for protection and propagation, the assistants to the Auxiliary Board members, all coordinated and kept in relationship to the Universal House of Justice by the International Teaching Centre, form the fabric of the appointive arm of the Administrative Order of the Faith, which will in increasing measure exert its spiritualizing influence upon the development of the Baha'i community and of all mankind.

      2. THE WORK AND TRAVELS OF THE HANDS
                  OF THE CAUSE

 THE Hands of the Cause of God, freed in 1968 of administrative duties, were able increasingly to devote their efforts to serving as standard-bearers for the Baha of the world in support of the teaching activities launched by National Spiritual Assemblies and other institutions of the Baha'i Faith. 

 In the opening phases of the Seven Year Plan, no less than in the teaching plans that preceded it, these remarkable individuals have been fonts of inspiration, encouragement t and reinforcement. Their contribution to the achievement of the goals and the influence of their example upon the Baha'i friends takes effect on numerous levels, both manifest and intangible. Their universal services in protecting the Cause of God; in proclaiming its truths; in deepening the knowledge of its adherents; in galvanizing the rank and file to greater heights of accomplishment; in awakening to an appreciation of the Baha'i Cause a large segment of the public, often uninformed of its true nature and its relevance to the spiritual and social perils confronting society; and in presenting Baha'i literature to Heads of State and others in authority, have continued unabated. 

 Not alone through their travels, but also through their consultation, their presence at gatherings large and small, their correspondence, their writings and addresses, their association with Baha'i pilgrims and their interaction with Baha'is in the field, often in farfiung and remote areas, they have diffused widely the Divine Era grances, declared His proofs, proclaimed His Faith, published abroad His Law, detached themselves from all things but Him, stood for righteousness in this world, and kindled the Fire of the Love of God in the very hearts and souls of His servants The years covered by this volume of the international record, Ridvan 1979 — 1983, have witnessed a regrettable thinning of the ranks of the Chief Stewards of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, leaving the community of the Greatest Name, at Ri4lvTh 1983, with ten. 

 Set out below is a record, ordered chronologically, of the tragic loss sustained in this period by the entire Baha'i world through the passing of six beloved Hands of the Cause of God: Enoch Olinga (September 1979), Dr. Rahmatu'116h Mirza (December 1979), Hasan M. Baha'i (February 1980), Dr. Adelbert Mtihlschlegel (July 1980), Abu'1-Qasim Faizi (November 1980) and Paul E. Haney (December 1982). Although these pages lack scope to chronicle the full range of the services of the Hands — some frail or in ill health but of undiminished spiritual power — let the following excerpts culled from Baha'i International News Service bulletins, and other sources, suggest in brief outline some of their major travels as well as a few of their other activities which are less amenable to documentation. Unfortunately, circumstances s obtaining in frAn prevent the reporting of the services rendered by the Hand of the Cause JaiM Kh6zeh.

  United States: More than six hundred and fifty Baha'is and their guests gathered from 31 August to 3 September at the 

Massanetta                 

 Springs Center in Harrisonburg, Virginia, for a conference on the theme of 'Spiritual 

Enrichment  and Self-dedication'-—  a

 topic derived from the Seven Year Plan message of the Universal House of Justice. The Hand of the Cause of God Dhikru'116h Khddem inspired those present with memorable stories and counsel. He pointed out that the Faith is spread and established through the sacrifice and devotion of the believers rather than through wealth or worldly power. Mrs. Javi-dukht  Khadem a member of the Auxiliary Board, also addressed the group.

 1979) Uganda:     The Hand of the Cause of God Enoch Olinga, together with his wife and three children, was buried on 24 September 1979 in the Baha'i Cemetery on Kikaaya Hill, in the precincts of the Mother Temple of Africa near Kampala, Uganda The funeral service took place at 2:00 p.m. in the Conference Hall of the National Haziratu'1-Quds  adjacent to the House of Worship and the Baha'i Cemetery. 

 As the gathered mourners sang 'All6h-u-AbhA', the coffins were carried reverently into the hail and placed at the head of the room. The coffin of the Hand of the Cause was in the special care of the members of the Continental Board of Counsellors;  the other pallbearers were members of the Olinga family and the large Baha'i 'family' in East Africa Over three hundred persons were present, many of whom had to stand outside the building during the service. Some had walked great distances to be present for the sad occasion, having been informed by special broadcasts on the State radio system. Official visitors included the Minister of Justice  as special representative of the President of Uganda, the former Ugandan Ambassador to Lesotho, the Bishop of Namirembe, the Canon of Makerere Church in Kampala, the Principal Immigration Officer, and other distinguished guests and representatives of the press. 

  The message of the Universal House of Justice was read during the service, recalling that the Guardian of the Faith had conferred upon Mr. Olinga the titles 'Knight of Baha'u'llah' and 'Father of Victories' before appointing  him, in 1957, the first native African Hand of the Cause of God. Other messages of condolence were read, and a brief summary of Mr. Olinga's life was given. 

 Prayers and other passages from the Baha Writings preceded and followed the messages, read in the Ateso, Luganda, Swahili, Persian and English languages Mr. Olinga's grave adjoins that of the Hand of the 

Cause M6s~ Ban6nf. Just

Mr. KMdem shared memories of the Guardian, thrilling the believers with his reminiscences, his presence and his perceptions  of the Guardian's legacy. The youth he urged to study The Advent of Divine Justice, and all were urged to study the writings of Shoghi Effendi. Joyous gatherings throughout the State marked the nine days, with special meetings for Local Spiritual Assemblies of Houston and Dallas, and firesides  in La 

Porte and Fort Worth      

 and at the Baha Club at Rice University. Mrs. Javidukht

  cablegram received from the Local Spiritual Assembly of Rosario 21 December 1979) Australia: On the last day of 1979, the Hand of the Cause H. Collis Featherstone arrived home in Rockhampton, Australia, from a ten-nation tour of the western Pacific and the Far East which lasted seventy-six days and took him to scores of Baha'i centres in cities, towns and villages. 

 A principal aim of Mr. Featherstone's trip, on which he was accompanied by his wife, Madge, was to participate in the 

National Teaching Conference

 of the Mariana Islands in Inarajan, Guam, on 20 — 21 

October                    

 Excellent publicity included a prominently-placed interview in the Pacific 

Daily Mail.                

 and a television spot on the evening news. 

 The Governor of Guam, Mr. Paul Calva, received the Featherstones and three local believers for a fifteen-minute interview, during which the Governor was given a copy of The Baha'i World, vol. XVI, on behalf of the National Assembly. 

 Following the conference, Mr. Featherstone visited village communities in Yap and Palau during a two-week period. 

 In Japan from 10 to 20 November, public meetings and firesides were held in major cities including 

Hiroshima where Mr. Feather-stone 

 gave ~i fireside talk to university students. At Amagasaki, Mrs. Featherstone addressed a gathering of eleven women. A public meeting in the goal city of Hirakata resulted in an enrolment. 

 Four days in Korea included gatherings with Auxiliary Board members and assistants, meetings with believers of Pusan and a Seoul public meeting with one hundred and four present, more than half of them enquirers. 

     In Taiwan the Featherstones

 were met on 24 November by a colourful international group of Chinese, Malaysian, 

Persian, Korean and American

 Baha'is bearing a large welcoming  banner. The cities of Taipei, Tainan, Hsintien and Kaohsiung held meetings for believers as well as firesides. 

    In Hong Kong Mr. Featherstone

 met with the Baha'i 'footballers' at the National Centre, spoke at a gathering for believers and met with an Auxiliary Board member and assistants. 

 A Bangkok newspaper reported the arrival of Mr. Featherstone in Thailand by calling him an 'international peace lecturer', reporting ing that he would be meeting 'VIPs and business leaders'. 

 Leaving Thailand on 10 December, the Featherstones divided the next twenty-one days among four countries, making teaching stops in Malaysia, where they attended a Winter School at Cameron Highlands, and in Singapore, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, returning home on 31 December (From reports received through 31 December 1979)

 1979) Ecuador: The Hand of the 

Cause of God Rahmatu'lhh   

 MuhAjir arrived in Ecuador from Lima, Peru, on 26 December. 

 He was greeted at the airport by a host of friends including members of the Continental Board of Counsellors who were in the country for one of their scheduled meetings. 

 Dr. MuhAjir was presented with several bouquets of red roses which he, in turn, lovingly presented to two of the indigenous believers from Otavalo as a token of his love and esteem. He shook hands and embraced all the friends, saying


<p486>
486                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

'Allah-u-Abha' Everyone    

 showed such happiness at being with Dr. Muh6jir that passersby paused to look on, some of them asking 'Who is he?' and giving the Baha'is an opportunity to mention the name of the Faith. 

 Dr. Muh6jir's schedule was hectic. He did not pause to rest after arriving at the airport, as he usually did in this altitude, but was driven directly to appointments including a radio interview aAd a meeting of the Counsellors. 

 Later that evening he spoke to the Baha'i community in Quito, and afterwards had a brief interview with members of the National 

Spiritual Assembly. The    

 following day he went to Esmeraldas accompanied by Auxiliary Board member 

Charles Hornby and Keikavous

 Vahdat to visit the new Baha'i institute that is being built and named in honour of the Hand of the Cause of God Enoch Olinga. After lunch Dr. MulThjir made three radio broadcasts followed by a fireside and a television interview On On 26 December he returned to Quito and resumed his busy schedule, conferring that afternoon with the Counsellors and then presiding over a joint meeting with the Counsellors, Auxiliary Board members and the National Spiritual 

Assembly.                  

 A conference for pioneers had been called by the 

National Spiritual Assembly
on behalf of the Continental

Board of Counsellors       

 Mount your steeds, 0 heroes of God! was always Dr. MuhAjir's motto and it was embodied  in the eagerness of those who were waiting to see how many far-reaching projects he would envisage and substantiated by the prompt movement of pioneers and teachers responding to the call. Whenever a new teaching plan was received from the Universal House of Justice, everyone knew it would not be long before a visit from Dr. MuhAjir was forthcoming to place in perspective any perplexities  that might be engendered by the vastness of the plan. 

 He would always open up new avenues and approaches to teaching. 

 after each session he would leave heads swirling by his edifying presence, his high spirits, his clarity of vision and, of course, by the amount of work he outlined to be accomplished  while, at the same time, giving the group the feeling that they had really planned it themselves On 29 December, after a full day's schedule, Dr. Muh4jir fell ill and was taken to a nearby emergency clinic for medical attention. During this time he was repeating the Greatest  Name with those who were caring for him and he smiled and talked with the doctor and nurse when his pain was not so acute. Counsellor Mas'6d Khamsf never left his side. About half an hour after his arrival at the clinic, Dr. Muh6jir lost consciousness and soon passed away (Adapted from a report by Mrs. 

Helen Hornby)              

  Ecuador: The Hand of the 

Cause of God Rahmatu'11Th  

 MuhAjir was bflried on 31 December 1979 in a beautiful cemetery high in the Andes mountains near Quito, Ecuador, where he died suddenly on 29 December following a heart attack. Appointed by the Guardian in October 1957, he was the youngest of the remaining Hands of the Cause The funeral services were planned by the National Spiritual Assembly in consultation with the Continental Board of Counsellors. Mrs. lr~n MuhAjir and daughter, Gisu, arrived  from the United States in time to choose a burial plot in the cemetery called 'Park of Memories' which Mrs. MuhAjir selected for its simple beauty and tranquillity. Dr. MuMjir's casket was surrounded by a profusion of floral tributes. 

 Attending were five of the six members  of the Board of Counsellors, Auxiliary Board members from four countries, and representatives of the National Spiritual Assemblies  of Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Believers from all parts of Ecuador increased the attendance to over one hundred persons At the cemetery, prayers were offered in several languages, the cabled tribute  from the Universal House of Justice was read as a fitting eulogy for the Hand of the Cause, and one of the Counsellors chanted in Arabic the Prayer for the Dead. 

 Mrs. Mulidjir had selected three plots in the cemetery to allow the grave to be oriented eastward, towards Babji On the same day the friends attended a conference to launch Dr. Muh6jir's audacious plan — now consecrated to his name — which calls for a vast expansion among the black and Indian population. The Counsellors cabled that REPRESENTATIVES

 He devoted eleven months out of the year to travel for the Faith Each country received him as their own because of his unique ability to be so completely attuned with the people of each place he visited The great love he showered on us all will always be a part of each one of us, awakening in us our own love for each other.

  1980) United Kingdom: The funeral service for the Hand of the Cause of God Ilasan M. Baha'i was held on 15 February 1980 at the New Southgate 

Cemetery in London.      

 Mr. Baha'i, who passed away peacefully on the morning of 12 February in London following a heart attack, was appointed a Hand of the Cause in October 1957. He also bore the title AfMn, indicating that he was a lineal descendant of the BTh. 

 but at this time let us remember most of all his example. Were we but to emulate to a small extent his great outpouring of physical and spiritual energies and his genuine kindness and love, and arise with sacrificial efforts to teach our brothers and sisters about this great all-encompassing Faith, then we would ensure that the spiritual heart of this great man —  Rahmatu'lHh MuMj jr — shall continue to pulsate  throughout these lands (From Baha'i Newsletter of Belize, January 1980)

 1979) 1980 Three hundred believers and friends gathered at 3:45 p.m. for a dignified and moving ceremony conducted by Mr. Philip Hams-worth on behalf of the National 

Spiritual Assembly. The  

 service began with a tribute on behalf of the Continental Board of Counsellors  for Europe by Mr. Adib Taherzadeh. Mrs. Marion Hofman followed with a tribute that included reading of a cabled message from the Universal House of Justice A reading in English of a passage from the writings of Baha'u'llah about the Hands of the Cause, by the son of the deceased, Mr. Robert Baha'i, was included in the programme prepared by the National Assembly. Eight members of the National Assembly attended, some of whom — together with members  of the family — acted as pallbearers. 

 Mr. Baha'i is buried in close proximity to the grave of Shoghi Effendi in a cemetery in the outskirts of London formerly known as the 

Great Northern Cemetery  

 In 1963, disabled by ill health which prevented his travelling, Mr. Baha'i took up his pen, devoting his remaining years to producing important literary works which are perhaps his most significant legacy to the Baha'i world. Among the books that streamed forth until the very last months of his life are: Baha'u'llah (a brief Life, accompanied by an essay 'The

 magnum opus, a major Life of Baha'u'llah,  was completed just before his passing in London on 12 February 1980 (From reports received during February 1980) 

   United States: The Baha'i  

 children's long-playing record album, 'Happy Ayy~m-i-HM', produced by Jo/ce and Danny Deardorff and released through Prism Productions, won a 1979 

Angel Award from RIM       
(Religion in Media). The   

 album features as host the Hand of the Cause William Sears and utilizes music arranged and conducted by Russ Garcia. Referring to Mr. Sears, the album jacket states, 'His special love for children is so beautifully expressed in this recording as he portrays a loving grandfather answering their questions and sharing their joy and laughter.' The award was presented during a ceremony on 14 February 1980 at the Hollywood Palladium  to Joyce and Danny Deardorff, producers of the album, and Marcia Day, executive  producer of Prism Productions. 

 This was the fifth annual awards programme sponsored by Religion in Media, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of religious values in the media and the album was one of only two non-Christian enterprises to win an award. Marcia Day ended her brief acceptance remarks by saying, 'We hope we accomplished what we set out to do — express for children the principles of the oneness of God, the oneness of religion and the oneness of mankind.' 

 The Baha'is had two large tables near the front of the assemblage, and stood out as the most lively and diversified group at the ceremouly.

May                        

  United States: Over one hundred Baha'is attended a threeday conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, held from 9 to 11 May. 

 The conference commemorated the visit of 'Abdu'l-Baha to that city in 1912. 

 The Hand of the Cause Dhikru'lhih KlAdem was the featured speaker for the occasion. Several of the meetings were held in the same room in Schenley Hall where the Master spoke in 1912 when it was the Schenley Hotel. 
It is now part of the      

University of Pittsburgh's 

 Student Union building Mr. KhAdem spoke several times during the weekend. 

 He outlined  the Master's visit to the United States, spoke on the station of the 

Manifestations of God      

 and of the authorized interpreters of the Baha'i Writings, and closed by encouraging all participants to deepen themselves in the Faith in order that they might better convey its truths (From a report received 26

Mexico, Europe and New     

 Zealand. A special lectureship on Baha'i history was initiated at this year's annual meeting in memory of the late Hand of the Cause I asan M. Baha'i. The Hand of the Cause John Robarts spoke about Mr. Balyiizf's life. Dr. 'Abbas Afnan and Dr. Muhammad AfnTh, both of whom are descendants of the BTh and relatives of the late Hand of the Cause, talked about his illustrious lineage. The special lectureship, which will be continued at future annual meetings, was capped by a scholarly address by Mr. Douglas Martin, a historian and secretary of the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Canada. He     

 reviewed Mr. Balyiizi's immense life work as a historian  (From a report received 23 July 1980) 

  World Centre: Abdu'l-Baha

 Rflhfyyih KhA-niim  left the World Centre on 25 June for a brief sojourn in England, travelling thereafter to Spain for a week's stay, which included visits to the friends in Madrid and Barcelona and the dedication of the Haziratu'1-Quds in the latter city. Following this she spent fourteen weeks in Toronto, Canada, editing a two-hour documentary film entitled 'The Pilgrimage'. 

 This historic film — a beautiful and deeply moving account of the Holy Placesdn 'Akka and Haifa — was written, narrated,  directed and edited by Abdu'l-Baha, and in addition to its interest to the public will provide a most effective and inspiring deepening  experience for the believers Filmed at the World Centre by Prism Productions Inc., 'The Pilgrimage' is a superb documentary depicting the Baha Holy Places in great detail. It is a two-hour, 16mm sound colour film on four reels to facilitate screening and is available in English, 

French and Spanish. (From

  United States: Your cable dated 29 July 1980 was received and on the following night, in the meeting of the friends in St. Louis, its text was read. 

 The hearts of the friends were deeply touched and grieved, but they felt resigned before the will of the Lord, fully conscious that the soul of Dr. Adelbert Mtihlschlegel is now in the AbhA Kingdom in the utmost joy and gratitude, as he recalls the efforts he exerted during his lifetime in the promotion of God's Hoiy Faith which is the sole path for the salvation of the world from the great convulsions with which it is beset...

CRADLE FAITH (From a       

 cablegram received 6 August 1980) Canada: A beautiful example of the kind of collaboration we are experiencing here in Canada between the institutions of the Faith took place at the annual 'Gathering'. 

 Organized  by the Hand of the Cause of God William Sears, this year's 'Gathering' was specially for the Auxiliary Hoard members and their assistants. 

 Three Hands of the Cause were among the honoured guests, Abdu'l-Baha 

Riihiyyih Khdnum, John     
Robarts and 'Ak-Muhammad Varqd.

 As soon as Mr. Sears learned of the new initiatives taken by the National Assembly,  however, he turned over a key portion of the programme to the Assembly to introduce its plan to focus the entire resources of the Canadian Baha'i community on winning our international pioneer goals. Throughout the weekend speakers continually referred to the National 

Assembly's plan. Those     

 present saw the entire administration move as one body in response to this priority focus. 

 A memorable part of the 'Gathering' was a special memorial service for the Hands of the Cause Enoch Olinga, Lasan M. 

Baha'i, Rahmatu'llAb      
Muhdjir and Adelbert       

 MUhi-. schiegel. It was very stirring to see four devoted Hands of the Cause gathered to pay tribute to their much loved coworkers. The potency of the occasion was augmented with the realization that these souls were four from a company of twelve remaining Chief Stewards. It was a priceless privilege to hear stories of the meetings of the conclaves of the Hands between 1957 and 1963, and to catch a glimpse of the comradeship and power that characterized these conclaves.

 1980. The service was attended by his fellow Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land, 'Alf-Akbar Funi-tan  and Paul Haney, members of the Universal 

House of Justice, Counsellor

 members of the International Teaching Centre, members of his family and the staff serving at the World Centre.

  bouquet of flowers, placed them around the graveside, kneeling and bowing their heads in sorrow at the passing of their beloved friend. 

 Earlier, all of the friends had assembled at the temporary Seat of the Universal House of Justice at No. 

10 Haparsim Street. Many   

 floral tributes from all over the world were placed at the front of the room, and the readings and prayers, especially one by Mr. Faizi's dearly-loved grandson, Paul, brought tears to the eyes of those who had the honour of witnessing  this touching tribute to the Hand of the Cause. His humility and love had endeared him not only to those with whom he lived and worked, but to the pilgrims and the-friends in different parts of the world with whom he had visited and corresponded, bringing them encouragement  and love. On Wednesday, 19 November, after two years of illness, he peacefully passed away in his own home. He is universally mourned, and remembrances of his gentle and loving nature will always be in our hearts. (From a report dated 15 December 1980)

    Switzerland: Approximately 

 eighty friends gathered on 1 November 1980 at 4:00 p.m. in Biichtold-Haus to commemorate the passing of the Hand of the Cause 

Adelbert MiThi-schiegel.   

 The participants, who came from all parts of Switzerland to express their affection and, admiration, recited prayers in various languages including Esperanto, one of the many languages spoken by Dr. Miihlschlegel. A number of people gave their recollections of Dr. Miihlschlegel and described happy moments spent in his presence. 

 A photograph of him, surrounded by flowers, was prominently displayed. Ginette Dunand revived before our spiritual eye the solemn and poignant scene at the most beautiful cemetery in Greece where friends from many places accompanied his mortal remains to their last resting-place. 

 They said their final farewells to the earthly 'temple' of this pure spirit and pledged themselves to follow his example of service. Those who have heard him describe being called by Abdu'l-Baha Riihfyyih Khd-num  to prepare the body of Shoghi Effendi for burial will not readily forget how vividly he seemed to relive that de6ply moving experience At the memorial service some of Dr. Mflhlschlegel's poems were read to the accompaniment of music and projected slides showing him surrounded by the friends in diverse gatherings. 

 The meeting ended with the chanting of a prayer. 

 The life of the Hand of the Cause of God was one deserving of emulation (Adapted from a report by Verena Stroligo in bulletin bahd'i suisse, December 1980) Canada: From many locations in British Columbia three hundred Baha'is came to Vancouver in November to hear the Hand of the 

Cause 'A1f-Mu1~ammad       

 Varq4 speak about the importance of developing a personal  teaching plan. 

 Dr. Varq6, who considers Canada his second home, spoke on the 'victories  which come with self-discipline'. 

 He spoke again at Nanaimo where fifty Baha'is assembled from distant points In Vancouver  he met with Bab6'f youth at a special meeting, telling of the crucial role they can play in the Cause, specifying their work in pioneering, teaching and child education. 

 Dr. VarqA also addressed a gathering of one hundred Baha'is in Calgary in November. (From a report received in December 1980) France: One hundred and sixty Baha'is of France attended a national teaching conference  in Paris on 22 — 23 November 1980 which was graced by the presence of the Hand of the Cause 

Ugo Giachery. Three Auxiliary

 Board members, Mr. Paul Hakim, Dr. 'Azfz Misb4h and Mrs. Diane Starcher participated, as did the members of the National Spiritual 

Assembly.  Sixty-five

 It has now been published in English for the first time. How to train a child according to Baha'i principles while dealing with day-to-day problems  is the subject of this immensely practical book. The Baha reader will realize, more than ever, some of the implications of the many references in the Baha'i Writings to child-training. The author approaches his subject with knowledge and zest, and his readers — parents — with sympathy and with encouragement to enjoy their children, to take a moral stand, and, above all, to realize that being a mother or father is an honourable activity. 

 Mr. Furtitan is wellknown throughout  the Baha'i world as an educator. 

 He was appointed a Hand of the Cause in 1951 and now, with three fellow Hands of the Cause and four Counsellors, he is one of those who constitute the nucleus of the International Teaching Centre at the World Centre of the Baha Faith. (From a report received December 1980) Canada:     The energetic support given the work of the Faith by the Hand of the Cause John Robarts has excited the admiration of the Canadian believers. 

 Following successful teacher-training sessions in November, he has been active in the Province of Quebec for the past several weeks, meeting with the National Spiritual Assembly, with a group of six Counsellors of the Americas, and with the Canadian National 

Teaching Committee. In    

 Toronto he attended important planning meetings in November with Counsellors Ar-bab and Gardner, Auxiliary Board members for Eastern Canada and National mid 

Regional  Teaching Committee

 members. The Hand of the Cause worked actively in Quebec from September through November, speaking at the 'stage' conferences, at the threeday French Council and the Native Council in October. He led intensive teaching workshops in 

Montreal,  Quebec City   
and Ottawa on three weekends.

 It is reported that the friends left the meetings inspired, refreshed and committed  to increasing their individual and group efforts. He next attended the Eastern 

Ontario Winter School     
and the International     

Developments  Conference 

 at the National Centre of Canada. The National Assembly writes, 'Both the Hand and his dear wife, Audrey, have cheered the friends with their vitality and enthusiasm (From a report received 1 January 1982)

 meeting he went to the New Era School, Panchgani, where he addressed the students and those friends who remained after the Winter School held there. Accompanied by Counsellor Mandchihr Salm6np6r he spent six days visiting  Karachi believers and consulting with the National Spiritual Assembly. He visited the community of Lahore in the Punjab area of North Pakistan which had not been visited by a Hand of the Cause since TarAzu'llTh Saman-darf  was there seventeen years ago. Returning to India on 13 January, Mr. Haney participated in a successful threeday teaching conference for North India held in New Delhi and then went on to the Indore Institute in Madhya Pradesh, the area of large-scale enrolments of recent years. He was accompanied  by the Counsellor, Mrs. Shirin Boman. Mr. Haney next travelled to Bangalore where he took part in the South 

India Teaching Conference  

 held in that city on 18 — 19 January. After twenty-five days of continuous travel, giving selflessly of his time and energies, Mr. Haney returned to the Holy 

Land on 21 January.        

  Europe:     As all the meetings of the Counsellors  on the five continents were about to begin, the Hand of the Cause of God Dhikru'-116h KMdem representative of the Universal House of Justice, all nine members of the Continental 

Board of Counsellors       

 in Europe, and visiting member of the International Teaching 

Centre, Counsellor Anneliese

 Bopp, sought guidance and rendered thanks for the historic meeting with prayers at the Mother Temple of Europe in Frankfurt. 

 Described as a 'wonderful, happy meeting', the first session opened with the message of the Supreme Body read by Mr. KMdem. Following the decisions on major policy, aspects of the work in Europe were reviewed with the valuable participation of Mr. KhAdem. A highlight of the days spent together came on Saturday evening when the Hand of the Cause spoke to the Counsellors and to many friends gathered from far and near in the National 

Hazfratu'1-Quds.  His      

 subject was the suffering of the Baha'is in fran and how sacrifice furthers the Cause of God (From a report received January 1981) Europe:     Thirtyfive days of intensive travel in 

December and January       

 by the Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery took him halfway around the world to Western Samoa for his fourth visit to that country. On 30 December he was received by His Highness the Malietoa Tanumafihi II Dr. Giachery's stay in Samoa included attendance at the 'most historic and bountiful Summer School ever', as reported by Counsellor Suhayl 'A16'f, who said that before 'a large gathering of more than two hundred friends from all three major is]ands and the island of Tau (Manua Islands), Dr. Giachery poured out his heart day and night, his luminous spirit enriching the heart and soul of every believer'. Dr. Giachery proceeded to the Hawaiian Islands where he

Moving on to Southern California, he attended gatherings two and three times a day, meeting old friends after an absence of eleven years (From a report received January 1981) United States: At a gala evening entitled 'A Tribute to the Hands of the Cause' sponsored by the Baha'i community of Irvine, California, on 12 January 1981, the Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery happily was able to be present, as if in answer to the prayers of the planning community in attendance were Counsellors

 Dr. Giachery's address on tile Guardian and the few remaining Hands was poignant beyond description. The marvellous evening was evidence of the reality of the spiritual power flowing from the Institutions of the Hands, the International Teaching Centre and the Continental Boards of Counsellors...

  The Americas: For nearly a year Abdu'l-Baha  Riihiyyih KhAnum's travels through the western hemisphere have brought countless opportunities to grateful national communities  to proclaim the Faith as never before. Since her participation in the Counsellors' conference held in January in Panama she has visited Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Antigua, Puerto Rico, the 

Dominican Republic, Haiti  

 and Jamaica •   The Baha'i community of Honduras shared nineteen unforgettable days with 

Ama-tu'1-BaM  Riihfyyih    

 KhThum. In the capital city she spoke to a capacity crowd at the Hotel Honduras Maya on world peace. 

 A national teaching conference opened the following day. 

 Forty Baha'is of the Paya Indian tribe travelled by chartered bus from the distant Department of Olancho. Accompanied by Mrs. Violette Na~javlii, Abdu'l-Baha paid a courtesy visit to the President of the City Council of Tegucigalpa. An article and a photograph appeared in a prominent paper, with details of the cordial discussion they held. 

 A picnic was held where many friends enjoyed the company of the Hand of the Cause Leaving Tegucigalpa on 5 February  she went by plane to the northern coastal city of La Ceiba where Baha from that community and from nearby Corozal were waiting in the airport. 

 When the plane touched down, the Black Carib Baha of Corozal began their typical dances, much to the surprise and enjoyment of Abdu'l-Baha Riihiyyih KlAnum. An in-depth radio interview  was broadcast by Radio Ceiba whose manager was greatly impressed by the wisdom and dignity of his guest She and her companion called on the Mayor of La Ceiba holding a cordial forty-minute interview. Following an afternoon press conference, she spoke in the evening to a crowd of more than two hundred persons, which included the Mayor and people from all classes of society. 

 A Saturday morning radio interview lasted for an hour; next came a two-day teaching conference with two hundred and fifty Baha'is from twenty-seven communities. She was next taken to the village of Corozal where Black Caribs, the Farfunas, live. More than two hundred Baha'is quickly gathered and performed  an ancient folk dance for the visitors that same evening thirtyfive new believers  embraced the Faith. The next day she paid a courtesy visit to the Governor of the Department of Atldntida, a woman. 

 The two women spoke together cordially for more than an hour about the Faith and its purposes. Another radio interview in the afternoon was followed by a visit to Sambo Creek village where a public meeting with more than one hundred Baha'is and seekers was held After a well-deserved day of rest, Abdu'l-Baha visited Brus Laguna in the heart of the Mosquitia area of swamps and lagoons walking for many hours, or canoeing, the beloved friends, men and women and children, arrived in small groups to meet the first Hand of the Cause to make that perilous journey. During the teaching conference they were like many small rivers of spirit flowing towards R6hiyyih Kh4num's ocean of love. 

 On 15 February the group walked to the village of Kusuapayka where the believers spoke of their ancient Miskito customs. 

 It was truly beautiful to see how they confided in her. She

KMnum and Mrs. Violette    

 Na~ja-v~.ni  in Belize, on 19 February the newspapers carried articles about Abdu'l-Baha and spoke of Belize as the 'one hundred and twenty-seventh  country to be visited by her'. 

 She was met at the plane by Counsellor Ahmadfyyih, members of the National Spiritual Assembly and the Deputy 

Mayor of Belize City.      

 Beneath  a large banner reading 'Abdu'l-Baha Riiljfyyih 

Kh6num — Welcome to Belize'  

 she was officially greeted on behalf of the Mayor and met Baha'is of Belmopan, 

San Ignacio, Belize City   

 and Burreil Boom. She had a special word for each one. All were captivated by her natural charm and open manner. 

 A banquet in her honour brought many distinguished guests. Her book Prescription for Living was distributed to each one as a gift from the National Assembly. 

 A public meeting  in the hotel ballroom brought nearly one hundred persons to hear her speak on 

'A Pattern for World Unity'.

 On the twenty-first she recorded three radio programmes — one for Radio Belize and two for the Baha'i series. 

 In the afternoon she travelled to the capital city, Belmopan, where a public meeting was held at the 

Baha'i Centre. On Sunday   

 an all-day conference brought nearly five hundred Baha from all over the country to the largest Baha'i gathering  ever held in Belize where the Knight of Baha'u'llah, Mrs. Shirley Warde, who has been a pioneer in Belize since 1953, was introduced. 

 A visit to the Governor of Belize was a cordial one. Books were given to him. The Commissioner of Police and his Deputy had met the Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga and expressed their great admiration for the Baha'is. 

     On 24 February Abdu'l-Baha

 Rhhfyyih KMnum was welcomed to the Carib settlement of Dangriga by the Mayor and a group of Baha'is. 
Later, she dined in the    

District Hazfratu'1-Quds   

 with the Local Assembly, all of whose members are Caribs. A Carib dance was performed in Town Hall by professional dancers, and was followed by a talk by Abdu'l-Baha to an audience of seventy people After meetings with the 

National                   
Spiritual Assembly, Abdu'l-Baha

 left for El Salvador, assured by the Belize friends that her visit, though short, 'had inspired all with a new spirit of dedication to the Cause of God'. (From reports received through 29 February 1981)

 A talk at the Cultural Centre was attended by seventy people, mostly women. 

 On the weekend, almost four hundred  Baha'is from all over the country, and some seekers as well, met at the International School to hear the visitor discuss many subjects  A Unity Feast was held on 1 March with the Hand of the Cause participating in the devotional part For nine days in Guatemala, Abdu'l-Baha gave talks and lectures for Baha'is and their guests. On 7 — 8 March about one hundred Baha'is arrived in the capital city to listen to the Hand of the Cause whose talks were filled with wisdom and inspiration. 

 On Monday she travelled to San Lucas Toliman, in Solol6, where she talked to indigenous believers of that area A banquet for prominent persons and a press conference completed the schedule in Guatemala City In YucatAn the seemingly tireless travellers spent a week, the most important events of which were: a reception tea with outstanding women of M&ida; a public meeting in the National 

Chamber of Commerce;       

 a halfhour interview with the assistant to the Mayor; a six-minute interview on the television news programme; and, finally, three regional teaching conferences with Mayan believers In a cablegram from the Hand of the Cause herself, the World Centre learned of her meeting on 20 March, the eve of Naw-Riiz, with Jos6 Lopez Portillo, the President of Mexico. 

 She states that she was 'received most courteously' and presented him with 

The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah

 and the statement  on obedience to government.

  came to Mbabane and many friends gathered on short notice to meet them at the Baha Centre there. 

 Mr. and Mrs. Sears told of their decision to return to Africa, a decision prompted  by the news of the death of Enoch Olinga which reached them while they were praying at the cornerstone of the 

Mother Temple of North    

 America. They had pioneered to South Africa from 1953 to 1959, the first Regional Assembly comprised of fourteen countries having been formed in a meeting at their farm near Johannesburg in 1956 (From a report received March 1981) Zimbabwe:     The dedication, on 22 March, of an outstanding 

Baha Centre at Templeton Ranch
Compound in Mtoroshanga   

 was made even more outstanding by the participation of the Hand of the Cause John Robarts and his wife, Audrey. The money to purchase the building materials of the new Centre was raised by the women of this community by baking small cakes in the kitchen of pioneers Mike and Becky Figgins and then selling them to workers in the nearby mines. 

 Four Baha men built the structure which is large enough to accommodate thirty to fifty persons Gifts were brought for the Occasion from the Continental Board of Counsellors, the Rose Garden community of Greater Salisbury and by visitors from Zambia. 

 Even from Urbana, Ohio, U.S.A., a gift was airmailed — a replica of the Greatest Name made especially for this Hazfratu'1-Quds. 

The Baha of Templeton  

 presented Mr. and Mrs. Robarts with a carving of the Zimbabwe bird and a large spoon and fork made from animal horns. Food was served to everyone from huge, three-legged iron kettles, standing over open fires. The friends sat under the trees eating together and singing music to lift the hearts on that beautiful day.

 From her succession of stunning victories in the 

Caribbean, Abdu'l-Baha    

 R6hiyyih Kh6-num  flew to Ottawa, Canada, for two talks before the Canadian Association for Baha'i Studies, continuing the unique service she has been rendering to the believers of the western hemisphere during almost one year of sustained effort. (From reports, newsletters and cablegrams received through 4 June 1981) Australasia and the Pacific: Leaving his home in February, the Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone, accompanied by his wife, began a seventy-two-day journey that took him to nine National Spiritual Assembly areas, scores of islands and to communities where he met many hundreds of individual believers. 

 Some highlights of his visits were: meetings with the Spiritual Assembly of Malaysia at Kuala Lumpur, and with the believers at Petalangjaya, assisting them with proclamation planning; in the Marianas, visits to pioneers on Saipan and Rota, bringing ideas and encouragement; in the Carolines the dedication of a new National Hazfratu'1-Quds on Ponape where his talk was recorded by a radio announcer to be repeated at intervals on Ponape radio broadcasts; meetings with believers, radio and press interviews in Majuro, in the Marshalls, and a courteous interview with President Amata Kabua who said, with great warmth, 'You have brought light into a dark room'; a busy prdgramme in Kiribati during which Mr. Featherstone met with the National Spiritual Assembly, gave a radio interview and travelled by motorized outrigger canoe (a three-and-a-half hour twenty-five mile trip) to meet with believers of Tewai village on Tabiteueau South. The Kiribati sojourn ended with a threeday teaching  conference in Tarawa and was followed by a ten-day visit to Fiji. Mr. and Mrs. Feather-stone returned to their home on 9 May for a brief respite (From reports received through 

1 June 1981)               

  Barbados:     During the stay in Barbados of the Hand of the Cause 'All-Muhammad Varq~ in May, when he attended the National Convention of that island country, he called on the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs, Mr. Brazane Bab. The cordial twenty-minute interview with Dr. Varqtt included presentation by the Secretary of the National Assembly of a kit containing Baha Writings and pamphlets to be passed on to the 

Minister of External       

 Affairs. There was also a short visit to the Chief of Protocol who was very friendly and who had visited the Shrine of the Mb on Mount Carmel.

     World Centre: Count PaoLo  

 Marzotto, the president of Industria dei Marmi Vicentini, the firm in Chiampo, Italy, which cut and carved all the marble and granite for the Shrine of the Bab, the International Archives building and the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, generously decided to bring to the Holy Land the workers whose skill and artistry has gone into the nearly-completed building which is to serve as the permanent Seat of the Universal House of 

Justice. Count and Countess

 Marzotto, accompanied by forty-four  guests, together with the Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery and Mr. Sohrab Yous-sefian, both of whom have been intimately connected with this great structure, arrived at the World Centre. 

 With the permission of the Universal House of Justice, some eighty Baha from Italy joined the special flight and came with the group to the World Centre for a threeday visit, bringing with them, as guests of the 

Italian National Spiritual 

 Assembly, five very prominent Italian journalists. 

 The visit proved to be a profoundly moving and highly significant occasion. 

 Early on Friday morning, the party from Industria dei Marmi Vicenfini and the journalists,  accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Husayn Am6nat, Mr. and Mrs. Youssefian and Mr. Giovanni Baha'u'llah, were taken to visit the old city of 'Akka and the Cell of Baha'u'llah. They then proceeded to Baha where they were welcomed by Dr. Ugo Giachery and those members of the Universal House of Justice who had served on the Building Committee, as well as members of the World Centre staff who had worked on the Seat,

  and their wives. After a cooling refreshment, all visited the Most Holy 

Shrine where Dr. Giachery  
recited the Tablet of      

Visitation in Italian      

 a moving address of welcome was given by the Hand of the Cause Dr. Giachery on behalf of the Universal House of Justice and a very touching and extremely cordial response was delivered by Count Marzotto. 

 Returning to Haifa, all went immediately to the Seat of the Universal House of Justice and were conducted through it by the architect, Mr. AmThat, and the resident engineer, Mr. 'Azfz Khabipfir. 

 That evening the Pilgrim House in Haifa was a joyous gathering place for the pilgrims, the Italian threeday visitors, the group from Chiampo and the journalists. 

 Count Marzotto and his guests left the following morning to visit the 

Christian Holy Places      

 in Israel, but the Italian journalists remained for two more days to visit other Baha'i Holy Places and to conduct interviews about the Faith. It was surely providential that they had thus been fully informed about the Cause and had had dispelled many misconceptions when, while they were still present, the tragic news reached the World Centre of the martyrdom of seven members of the Spiritual Assembly of Hamatn. This news affected them deeply, and they left for Rome determined  to do all they could to ensure that the public would Learn the truth of the tragic events.

  Alaska:     A total of fifty-nine different activities were reported by thirteen Alaskan communities  in response to the inspiring plan launched by the Hand of the Cause William Sears last year before leaving North America to reside in Africa. Called 'Operation Befriend',  the disarmingly simple but effective application of the Teachings consists of Baha'i communities discovering ways to serve their larger community. 

 Notable service activities of Alaskan communities: an international music festival with proceeds given to a local charity; a Human Rights essay contest; a cultural arts fair; Baha'i music in community chorus programmes; murals for a children's ward of a hospital; a dance group which performs for schools. One community helped immigrants to attain official status, assisting with government procedures. 

 In one community  Baha children wrote, planned and performed a mini-circus for a geriatric ward in a hospital. Some communities assisted with civic cleanup days, made donations of food, goods or services to non-Bah6'f functions, participated in Local parades and celebrations,

 of the Cause 'ALP Akbar Furdtan returned to the 

Holy Land on 30 December   

 after a tour of Canada and the United States focusing on communities in Ontario, Canada; and Boston, Alexandria and Southern California in the United States. During the four-month trip, Mr. Furhtan gave eighty-two talks to diversified and to solely-Persian audiences. In a meeting with the friends who serve in the Holy Land which was held in the magnificent new Seat of the Universal House of Justice, he commented that he was astonished and touched by the love which he observed, during his tour, between the Persian and Western friends. Many mornings he would be visited by the families of the martyrs. 

 Mr. Fur6tan admitted that often the stories they told would be so moving that he would have to tell them he could bear no more, but when he attempted to console them, he found that their response was only humble pride at the courage and steadfastness of their relatives who had suffered  martyrdom. 

 He was accompanied and assisted on his journey by his daughter, Mrs. IrAn Muh6jir.

 A book exhibit was mounted at the district Haziratu'1-Quds of Rajshahi, containing publications in Bengali, English and other languages, and accompanied by posters illustrating Baha'i principles about one thousand persons visited, twenty of whom embraced the Faith. A slide show on the Faith was well attended each evening.

 One chain carries a complete range of Baha titles (From a report received December 1982) Costa Rica: The national teaching plan of Costa Rica was launched at a Summer School in December, in the name of the late Hand of the Cause of God Paul B. Haney. The two hundred and fifty persons who attended the school, including indigenous believers from Talamanca, were inspired by the presence of three Counsellors of the Continental Board —  Mrs. Lauretta King, Mrs. Ruth Pringle and Mr. 

Rail Pav6n.                

  Haiti: In consultation with the National Spiritual Assembly, the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Riihfyyih Kh4num worked out a detailed schedule for her five weeks in Haiti during which she and her companion, Mrs. Violette Na!~j av4ni travelled the length and breadth of the country and visited twenty-five Baha'i communities. 

 'In Abdu'l-Baha's estimation,' her companion reported, 'the outstanding  event was the opening of the island of lle-4i-Vache, one of the goals of the Seven Year Plan of the Universal House of Justice, where twenty-eight people accepted the Faith, including the Magistrate of this charming tropical island of over 7,000 inhabitants. Riihfyyih KhAnum, accompanied by eight other Baha'is, hired a boat in the town of Les Cayes and crossed the turbulent sea, over an hour's trip; the weekly market had brought many buyers and sellers, not only from this little island but also from the mainland. Moving in the crowded market amongst the friendly and cheerful people, she attracted a number of people, and when the Magistrate

  suggested that we sit under a grove of coconut palms by the sea for our picnic lunch, she invited him to join us. Afterwards she asked the Auxiliary Board member, Mr. Ren6 Jean Baptiste, to give in Creole an introductory talk on the Faith; questions were asked, literature distributed, and our hearts were moved when the Magistrate and twenty-seven other people accepted the Cause. 

 We have since heard that in followup visits by other Baha'is these new believers have proved their sincere devotion to the Cause of God.' 

 The few days spent in Toronto, Canada, prior to her return to the Holy Land coincided with the memorial meeting held there for the Hand of the Cause Paul E. Haney. Two Hands of the Cause, John Robarts, who acted as chairman for the occasion, and Dr. 'All-Muhammad  Varq6, were present on the podium with Abdu'l-Baha; her moving tribute  in memory of her distinguished coworker and 'lifelong friend' deeply touched the audience of over five hundred Baha'is who were present. 

 In a period of five and a half months Abdu'l-Baha has covered over thirty thousand  miles and visited over eighty-five centres (From reports received through December  1982) 1983

  Australasia: Between 1    

 December and 31 January, the Hand of the Cause Collis Feather-stone, accompanied by Mrs. Featherstone visited the Philippines, Japan, korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, as well as two locations in Australia. Mr. Featherstone's activities in the Philippines included a meeting with the Dean of the University of Philippines College to whom he presented a proclamation book which was warmly received. 

     In Japan Mr. Featherstone 

 met with Baha'is at the Osaka Centre then flew to Kagoshima and taxied to Ibusuki, sister city to Rockhamp-ton,  Australia, Mr. Featherstone's home town. On 13 December, Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone met the Mayor and presented colour photos of the Japanese 

Garden in Rockhampton.    

 (On a later occasion the proclamation book and pamphlet were presented to the Mayor.) They went next to the site of the Australian garden, to be planted later in the year with 2,000 Australian gum trees and other shrubs. In Tokyo the Featherstones met with the National Spiritual Assembly in the New National 

Hazfratu'1-Quds.          
    In Korea Mr. Featherstone 

 met with the youth of Seoul and was received by the Vice Mayor of Anyung City. He spoke at a public meeting there and also at the Baha'i Winter School at Kadrion Mountain in the Doug Hang Temple area. 

 Mr. Featherstone addressed the English-speaking division of Rotary Club at the Hilton Hotel in Taipei, met the Mayor of Fengyuen, and spoke to the friends at the 

Baha'i Winter School.     

 Many prominent officials were contacted  by the Hand of the Cause while he was in Taiwan, among them the Governor who knew of the Faith and was most cordial, and who accepted a copy of The Baha'i World, vol. XVII, and the proclamation pamphlet. 

 The friends gathered at the airport in Hong Kong to receive the Hand of the Cause. S&veral hundred people read the Baha'i banners  in Chinese, Vietnamese and English, and many asked questions. 

 The Featherstones were taken by jet hydrofoil to Macau and were immediately taken to a luncheon attended by seventy people including members of the press and radio. Excellent publicity resulted in the press. 

 The Mayor praised the Baha'is so much that media representatives asked him if he was a Baha'i. A radio spot on 11 January gave twenty minutes of prime time to the Faith, the announcer describing the teachings, reading from the Writings and giving the address of the Baha'i Centre, urging everyone listening 'to investigate this beautiful Faith for themselves'.

Malaysia, the Featherstones

 attended the Feast at the National Hazfratu'1-Quds. 

Returning to Australia    

 on 22 January, the Hand of the Cause fulfilled a schedule of deepening classes, meetings with Auxiliary Board members and their assistants, a meeting with youth, an open house and a public meeting held jointly with Counsellor Dr. Peter Khan — three days of activity arranged by the Regional Teaching Committee of Western Australia in the area of Perth. On 29 — 30 January Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone took part in the South Australian Youth Camp at Mt. Breckon, Victor Harbour. In the evening the Hand of the Cause addressed a public meeting and the following day set out for home. (From reports received through

          4. A TRIBUTE TO THE HANDS OF THE
                    CAUSE OF GOD1
                    LILIAN 'ALA'f

  Light and glory, greeting and praise be upon the Hands of His Cause, through whom the light of fortitude hat/i shone forth and the truth hat/i been established that the authority to choose rests with God, the Powerf iii, the Mighty, the Unconstrained. 

 We beseech Him — exalted is He — to shield them through the power of His hosts, to protect them through the potency of His dominion and to aid them through His indomitable strength which prevczileth over all created things ~\Viiri these words Baha'u'llah in His Tablet of the World (Lawh-i-Duny~) describes the station of servitude to which the Hands of the Cause of God are called. 

 He beseeches God to shield them, to protect them and to aid them. They are His precious trust among us and their like will never be seen again. Perhaps the greatest tribute one can pay is to speak of their place in Baha'i history. We are so intimately associated with them and stand so near to them, that only future historians will be able to do full justice to their exploits. 

 The origin of the Hands of the Cause can be found in the Writings of Baha'u'llah. 

 During His lifetime lie appointed four to assist 

Him.                       

 Many references to the Hands of the Cause can be found in the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 He clearly defined their station and functions but did not appoint any living Hands of the Cause. 

 However, there were certain outstanding teachers of the Faith who, after their passing, were referred to by 'Abdu'l-Baha as 

Hands.                     

 For thirty years Shoghi Effendi continued to do as his Grandfather had done, and it was not until December 1951 that he cabled the following announcement to the Baha'i world: 

I-JOUR NOW RIPE TAKE LONG  
INEVITABLY DEFERRED  STEP 
CONFORMITY PROVISIONS ABDIJL-BAIIAS
TESTAMENT. APPOINTMENT FIRST
CONTINGENT HANDS CAUSE

  1 An address given by Lilian 'Ahif during the 

International Baha'i Conference
held in Canberra, Australia,

1 — 4 September 1982.        
TWELVE IN NUMBER EQUALLY   
ALLOCATED                  
                           
HOLY LAND ASIATIC AMERICAN

CONTINENTS.                

  He then went on to say that this step was in preparation for the full development of the Institution provided in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament. Furthermore, he said that there would be a parallel measure — the formation  of the Universal 

House of Justice.          

 The Guardian then named the twelve Hands of the Cause. In the Holy Land, 

Sutherland Maxwell, Mason  
Remey, Amelia Collins (President

 and Vice-President of the International  Baha'i Council); in the Cradle of the Faith, Valfyu'llTh Varq~, TarAz'uIlAh Saman-dad, 'AII-Akbar Funitan; in the American continent, 

Horace Holley, Dorothy     

 Baker, Leroy Loas; and in the European continent, George Townshend, Hermann Grossmann and 

Ugo Giachery.              

 During the remaining six years of his life he dev&loped the Institution of the Hands of the Cause, broadening and strengthening the scope of its activities, appointing additional Hands and providing for the appointment by the 

Hands of Auxiliary Board   

 members who were to assist them in their work. 

     In February 1952 the Guardian

 raised their number to nineteen by adding another seven distinguished Baha, namely, Fred Schop-flocher, 

Corinne True Dhikru'116h   
KiA-dem,  Shu'6'u'11Th     
'AU'f Adelbert Mill-schiegel, 

Mash Banani, and Clara     

 Dunn. The body of the Hands of the Cause now


<p517>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH   517

  represented all five continents of the globe and the 'three principal world religions of mankind'. He said that they had a twofold sacred function, propagation and preservation of the unity of the Faith of 

Baha'u'llah.                

 For five years after 1952 there was no increase in the number of Hands. 

 However during that time five of them passed away —  namely, 

Sutherland Maxwell, Fred   
Schop-flocher,  Dorothy    
Baker, Valiyu'IlAh Varq~ and

George Townshend. Abdu'l-Baha
Rfihfy-yih  KhThum, JaLAI  

 KhAzeh Paul B. Haney, 'Alt-Muhammad Varq~ and Agnes Alexander were appointed to replace them. 

 In his last message to the Baha'i world the beloved Guardian raised the membership of the Hands of the Cause to twenty-seven. Many of us will recall the exciting years of the World Crusade. He described the astonishing achievements of those days as 'So marvelous a progress, embracing so vast a field, achieved in so short a time, by so small a band of heroic souls He then said that this progress well deserves to be signalized by, and indeed necessitates, the announcement of yet another step in the progressive unfoldment of one of the cardinal and pivotal institutions ordained by Baha'u'llah involving the designation of yet another contingent of the Hands of the Cause of God The eight now elevated to this exalted rank are: Enoch Olinga, 

William Sears John Robarts 
Hasan Baha'i             
•    John Ferraby     Collis Featherstone
•    Rahmatu'llAh MulThjir     and

Abu'1-QAsim                

 QAsim Faizi. a group chosen from the four continents of the globe, and representing the AfnAn, as well as the black and white races and whose members are derived from Christian,  Muslim, Jewish and Pagan backgrounds. 

 Many of the Hands of the Cause were also pioneers of the World Crusade and yet others became homefront pioneers. 

     During Ridvan 1954 Shoghi  

 Effendi implemented  his promised inauguration of the auxiliaries of the Institution of the Hands, namely, the Board members, who were to act as deputies, assistants and advisers to the Hands and work in conjunction with the National Spiritual Assemblies, through calling upon the Hands to appoint thirty-six Board members, nine each in America, Europe, and Africa, seven in Asia, and two in Australia. 

Five Continental Funds     

 were also inaugurated at that time. 

    The first International    

 Baha'i Council had already been appointed by Shoghi Effendi, in 1951; its membership included five 

Hands, Abdu'l-Baha Rfihiyyih
KhAnum, Mason Remey, Amelia

Collins, Ugo Giachery      

 and Leroy Joas. Four lived in the Holy Land and the fifth, Dr. Giachery, who was pioneering in Italy, was designated as member-at-large. 

     In June 1957 the Guardian  

 called upon the Hands of the Cause and the National Assemblies  to engage in close association and consultation not only in connection with the teaching work, but especially in regard to the protection of the Faith. In his last message to the Baha'i world he further expanded the Institution of the Hands of the Cause by requesting each group of continental Hands to appoint an Auxiliary Board with the specific duty of watching over the security of the Faith. 

 And so we can see how, step by step, in less than six years, he built a strong Institution functioning throughout the world whose nerve centre was in the Holy Land. In addition, the parallel body, the International Baha'i Coun-cii,  had also been established. 

 Very suddenly, a few short weeks later Shoghi Effendi, the Sign of God on earth and our beloved Guardian, ascended to the world beyond, leaving behind a grief-stricken corn-munity,  bewildered and bereft. Upon the Hands of the Cause now fell the onerous task of directing and safeguarding the affairs of the Faith of 

God.                       

 It is well for us to think deeply about the events that followed the sudden removal from our midst of our beloved Guardian, the one who had for so long and so lovingly guided our steps. Let us not forget that when the Blessed Beauty's ascension took place He left a Will appointing 'Abdu'l-Baha and when 'Abdu'l-Baha passed to the great beyond, He too left a Will appointing Shoghi Effendi. I do not feel that any Baha'i can pay greater tribute to the Hands of the Cause than acknowledging and being eternally grateful to them for the steps they now took. 

 'It was upon R'lihfyyih KMnum in... her hour of greatest trial and grief that the terrible weight of responsibility rested of informing the Baha'is of the world that their Guardian had suddenly passed away. It devolved upon


<p518>
518                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  her to initiate the steps necessary to protect the Faith at this moment of unparalleled crisis.' 

 She lovingly did so in a series of cables to the Baha'i world preparing them for the news of his passing. She 'telephoned the members of the International 

Baha'i Council in Haifa   

 It was agreed that immediate steps be taken to seal the door of the apartment occupied by the Guardian in order to ensure that no person should enter these quarters until the Hands of the Cause could take appropriate action By November 8, nearly all Hands of the Cause had arrived in London. At the request of R6hfyyih KhAnum, they met that night to plan the funeral service This tragic and moving occasion marked the first meeting of the Hands from the Holy Land and the various continents since their appointment by Shoghi Effendi.' 

     'On November 15, 1957     
Riihfyyih Kh6num, Mason   
Remey, Amelia Collins     

 and Leroy Loas, accompanied by Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery entered the apartment  of the Guardian and sealed with tape and wax the safe where important documents were kept. The keys of the safe were placed in an envelope which was sealed and signed by the five Hands and then placed in the safe of Mr. Loas, the Secretary-General of the International  Baha'i Council. The drawers of Shoghi Effendi's desk were also sealed and the seals countersigned. 

 'Three days later, on November 18, 1957, just two weeks after the ascension of the Guardian, the Hands of the Cause assembled in the Holy Land, held a memorial meeting in the precincts of the Shrine of Baha'u'llah, and then entered upon fateful days of prayerful  and soul-searching consultation which led to vital and far-reaching decisions The historic document, Proclamation by the Hands of the Cause to the Baha of East and West, written from the meeting, contained these words: 'On the following morning, 

November 19th, nine Hands 

 of the Cause, selected from the Holy Land, and the several continents of East and West, with Abdu'l-Baha Riihfyyih Kh6num broke the seals placed upon the beloved Guardian's safe and desk and made careful examination of their precious contents. These same Hands, rejoining the other Hands assembled  in the 

Mansion of Baha'u'llah     

 at Baha'i, certified that Shoghi Effendi had left no 

Will and Testament. It    

 was likewise certified that the beloved Guardian had left no heir. The Aghs6n (branches) one and all are either d&~id or have been declared violators of the Covenant by the Guardian for their faithlessness to the Master's Will and Testament and their hostility to him [who was] named first Guardian in that sacred document. 

 'The first effect of the realization that no successor to Shoghi Effendi could have been appointed by him was to plunge the Hands of the Cause into the very abyss of despair From this dark abyss, however, contemplation of the Guardian's own life of complete sacrifice and his peerless services gradually redeemed  our anguished hearts The Hands then wrote of the achievements of the beloved Guardian in woTds designed to encourage and strengthen the friends. 

 'Has not the World Centre, with its sacred Shrines and institutions, been firmly established?  Has not the Message been established in 254 countries and dependencies? Have not the National and Regional 

Spiritual Assemblies     

 been implanted in twenty-six great areas of all continents? 

 Has not the Guardian left us not oniy his incomparable translations, for English-reading Baha'is, of the Baha'i sacred literature but also his own master works of interpretation which disclose to us the unshatterable edifice of an evolving Baha'i Order and world community? 

 Has not the Guardian, building upon the enduring foundation  of the Master's Tablets of the Divine Plan, created the World Crusade to guide our work until 1963? Has not the Guardian, moreover, in his mysterious insight into the fresent and future needs of the Baha'i community, called into being the 

International Baha Council

 and the company of twenty-seven Hands with their Auxiliary Boards, whom in his final communication to the Baha'is, he designated "Chief Stewards of the embryonic World Commonwealth of 

BaM'u' -11Th"?            

 'Beloved friends! Is not the most precious legacy bequeathed to us all by Shoghi Effendi the privilege of constancy in the Faith of


<p519>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA' U' LLAH  519

  Baha'u'llah and devotion in teaching His Message? 

 This is the heartfelt plea we direct to every Baha: The hour has come, as it came with the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, when true Baha'is will be distinguished by their firmness in the Covenant and their spiritual radiance while pressing forward the mighty work committed to every area of the world cornmunity — to every individual Baha'i! For now our implacable opponents may, and probably will, unleash attacks, assuming in their ignorance that the Faith of Baha'u'llah is weakened and defenceless. 

 By consecration of spirit we are armed against all manner of assault and we hold the weapon of faith with which the triumph of the Guardian's aims and purposes is assured Such were their words as they took us under their protection. 

 In other documents the Hands of the Cause made decisions on how their body would function and their relationship with 

National Assemblies. In   

 response to their appeal, all National and Regional Assemblies in the Baha world recognized the body of the nine Hands in the Holy Land and gave their full support. 

 Because of this and actions taken by the Hands, it was possible to safeguard the Baha'i properties and funds and to be recognized by the Government. 

 From that time onwards until the establishment of the Universal House of Justice in 1963 the Hands of the Cause sent a series of messages to the Baha world from each of its annual conclaves. 

 They actively and unceasingly encouraged the friends to attain the goals set by the Guardian and watched over the community with loving hearts. In 1959 they wrote: 'As we look back over the past two years which have elapsed since that unforgettable  and heartbreaking moment when we realized our beloved Guardian had been taken from us, we cannot but marvel at the protection which has been vouchsafed this Holy Cause. As one man, the believers have rallied to the support of their Faith, closed their ranks, stood firm in the hour of supreme test, and arisen to carry forward the World 

Crusade.'                 

  In the same message they announced that the election of tile International 

Baha'i Council           

 by all members of National and Regional Assemblies would take place during 

Ridvan                    
1961.                     

 In their 1960 message they mentioned that since 1953 almost 3,000 pioneers had left their homes and scattered over the face of the planet. There was evidence of the possibility of mass conversion. Tens of thousands of people in Africa, India and South America were becoming Baha'is and it became necessary  for the Hands of the Cause to devote their labour on a global scale. Thus they began their journeys throughout the countries of the world bringing hope and encouragement to the friends and edifying the hearts of all men. They attended a multitude of conferences, summer schools, conventions. 

 They met with all strata of society froiii the highest to the lowest in the land. They met with pioneers, often making special and difficult journeys to be with a lone pioneer, to cheer their hearts and encourage them and the fledgling communities  that were being created around them. 

 And through it all, they lovingly watched over and protected the Faith. 

 As far back as 1961 they prepared the Baha'i world for the election of the 

Universal House of Justice
during Ri~1v6n 1963.      

 This long-awaited and eagerly anticipated event took place on the first day of Ridvan 1963 in the central hail of the historic home of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the Guardian in Haifa. 

 Two hundred and eighty-eight members of fifty-six National and Regional Assemblies were present  as delegates, representing every continent and the islands of the seas, and from virtually every one of the major races and ethnic groups of mankind. 

 The Universal House of Justice, the supreme legislative body ordained by Baha'u'llah and vouchsafed by Him as being under the unerring guidance of God, had been established. The master helmsmen had sailed the seas charted by the beloved Guardian and brought their vessel to safe harbour. 

    In 1968, the Universal    

 House of Justice met in consultation with the Hands of the Cause and from this meeting came the Institution of the Continental Boards of Counsellors which was to 'grow and operate in harmony with the principles governing the functioning of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause'. 

 The Auxiliary Boards then came under the direc

tion of the Continental   

Boards of Counsellors. The
International Teaching    

 Centre was established in 1973 'destined to evolve into one of those world-shaking, world-embracing, world-directing  administrative institutions ordained by Baha'u'llah. Its establishment brings to fruition the work of the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land.' 

 Many years have passed, and from the original twenty-seven Hands only eleven remain.  Many of them have visited the countries and islands encompassed by this conference and have become very dear to us. Some, such as Agnes Alexander, 

John Henry and Clara Hyde 
Dunn, Rahmatu'lhh Muh6jir 

 and dear Collis Featherstone, have lived and continue to Live among us. Abdu'l-Baha Rdhfyyih KIAnum dedicated the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Antipodes and represented the Universal House of Justice at the laying of the foundation stone of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Pacific in Samoa. 

 Our very dear Dr. Giachery, besides his memorable work in connection with the Shrine of the B~b, was instrumental in presenting the Proclamation of Baha'u'llah in such a way to His Highness 

Malietoa Tanumafihi II    

 of Western Samoa, that he was moved to declare his belief in Baha'u'llah and to visit the resting-place of the beloved Guardian. 

 All of them, including the Hands of the Cause 

Enoch Olinga, 'Ali-Akbar  
Furfitan, Dhikru'llAh     
Khidem, William Sears,    

John Robarts and Abu'1-Q6sim

 Faizf, made great teaching journeys through our lands and islands. They took our burdens upon their shoulders. Nowhere in recorded religious history has there been such a group of people as the Hands of the Cause of God, who, with such purity of soul, selflessness, complete dedication and faithfulness, guided and watched over an emerging religion. 

 To them, in remembrance of their fortitude, I address the beautiful poem contained in the following Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha: 0 thou who han been sore afflicted on the pathway of the Covenant! Anguish and torment, when suffered on the pathway of the 

Lord, Him of Manifest     

 signs, is only favour and grace; affliction is but mercy, and grief a gift from God. Poison is sugar on the tongue, and wrath is kindness, nourishing the soul. 

 Then praise thou Him, the loving Provider, for having ordained this dire affliction, which is but bounty unalloyed. 

  If I, like Abraham, through flames must go, Or yet like John a bloodstained road must run,• 

If Joseph-like, Thou'd    

 cast me in a well, Orshutme up within a prison cell —  Or make me e'en as poor as Mary's Son —  I will not go from Thee, But ever stand My soul and body bowed to Thy command. 

  Dear friends, when we become tired and dispirited, when our goals seem unobtainable, let us think of them. Let us try, in some small way to be like them. They are our Hands of the Cause and the world has never seen their like. 

  Light and glory, greeting and praise be upon them!

          5. THE HANDS OF THE CAUSE OF GOD:
                   AN APPRECIATION

                     RAY HUDSON

  A~MONG the wonders accomplished by Shoghi Effendi during the last few years of his ministry was the elevation to the rank of Hands of the Cause of God of a few believers from among the Baha'is of the world: These precious souls were like jewels buried among the mass of the believers until the beloved Guardian plucked them out. The consummate wisdom of this action became evident when the Universal House of Justice, in its first message presented 30 April 1963, at the World Congress, paid tribute to the work accomplished by the Hands of the Cause following the passing of the Guardian: 

 'The Universal House      

 of Justice, with pride and love, recalls on this supreme occasion its profound admiration for the heroic work which they have accomplished. We do not wish to dwell on the appalling dangers which faced the infant Cause when it was suddenly deprived of our beloved Shoghi Effendi, but rather to acknowledge with all the love and gratitude of our hearts the reality of the sacrifice, the labor, the self-discipline, the superb stewardship of the Hands of the Cause of God.'1 

        The World Order of Baha'u'llah

 is crowned with the Universal House of Justice, an Baha'u'llah Himself named the first Hands of the Cause and called them those through whom the light of fortitude bath shown forth and the truth hath been established that the authority to choose rests with God. 

 He said they were those through whom the ocean of bounty hath surged and the fragrance of the gracious favours of God, the Lord of Mankind,  hath been diffused.3

 Institution which was created by Baha'u'llah Himself and which is under the guidance of both Baha'u'llah and the Bab. 'Abdu'l-Baha declared this body to be the source of all good and freed from all error.2 

The beloved Guardian     

 labored all his life to erect this Institution which is twin to the Institution of the Guardianship, and through those Hands of the Cause whom he appointed the election for this Supreme Body was called. 

 The work of the Hands of the Cause constitutes an integral part of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 Today this work is flourishing throughout the world, and under the guidance of the Universal House of Justice it will continue in future decades and centuries. The story of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause of God is such that centuries will be unable to fathom the love these believers held for their beloved Guardian nor will ages comprehend the iron resolution of their steadfastness in the Covenant of Baha'u'llah. 

 There will be no repetition of their ekamples. They are unique among the followers of Baha'u'llah. They are the priceless gifts which Shoghi Effendi gave to us. Where does the story of such enduring love begin?

 Certain outstanding Baha'is, however, were referred to by Him as Hands.

  Shortly after His ascension it was discovered  that 'Abdu'l-Baha had produced an extraordinary Will and Testament, portions of which outlined the appointment, duties, and obligations of the Hands of the Cause. Written entirely in His Own hand, this great testament,  the Guardian has declared, is the Charter of the Administrative Order, 'His greatest legacy to posterity' and 'the brightest emanation of His mind.'1 Providing an 'indissoluble  link' insuring 'the continuity of the three ages that constitute the component parts of the Baha Dispensation '2 (the Heroic, the Formative, and the Golden Ages) this document  requires 'time, and the guidance of God's Universal House of Justice, to obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of its provisions  and implications.'3 The Guardian, writing through his secretary, stated: 'The contents of the Will of the Master are far too much for the present generation to comprehend.  It needs at least a century of actual working before the treasures of wisdom hidden in it can be revealed ~ In God Passes By, page 328, Shoghi Effendi summarizes, in his concise and masterly way, the contents of the Will and Testament. 

 Here, however, we are primarily interested in what was written about the Hands of the Cause. 

 The appointment of the Hands of the Cause, 'Abdu'l-Baha categorically states, must be made by the Guardian of the Cause. 

  The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the character of all men and to be, at all times and under all conditions, sanctified and detached from all earthly things. They must manifest the fear of God by their conduct, their manners their deeds and their words.5 

  The Hands of the Cause are urged by 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 to diffuse the sweet savors of God, and to guide all the peoples of the world, for it is the light of Divine Guidance that God Passes By, p. 325.

 causeth all the universe to be illumined.6 'Abdu'l-Baha further bestows salutation and praise upon the Hands [pillars] of the Cause of God that have diffused widely the Divine Fragrances, declared His Proofs, proclaimed His Faith, published abroad His Law, detached themselves from all things but Him, stood for righteousness in this world, and kindled the Fire of the Love of God in the very hearts and souls of His servants.7 

 He also states: This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the guardian of the Cause of God.8 As we witness (and as history will study) the steadfastness and complete, wholehearted, joyful obedience of the Hands of the Cause we might understand  the meaning of being under the direction of the guardian of the Cause. The spontaneity that they have shown in fulfilling the wishes of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice endures as a lasting lesson to all Baha'is. 

 Obedience is the true measure of love for Baha'u'llah; the loving devotion of the Hands of the Cause found expression in an exact and instantaneous obedience. 

 Such obedience does not come automatically.  By appointment as Hands of the Cause these believers were not guaranteed steadfastness in the Covenant. When 'Abdu'l-Baha placed the Hands under the direction of the Guardian He said: Should any, within or without the company of the Hands of the Cause of God disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance will be upon him, for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of God.9 

 Yet 'Abdu'l-Baha. stressed that the Hands had responsibility for protecting the Cause. 

 He said they must be ever watchful and He gave them the authority needed to preserve the security of the Faith. 

 In formally establishing this institution 'Abdu'l-Baha presented the Hands of the Cause with the dualfunction of guarding over the security, and of insuring the propagation, of 

His Father's Faith.10     

 'Abdu'l-Baha called them to this high station.

  fastness, encompass such knowledge, and personify such love? During the thirty years that followed 'Abdu'l-Baha's ascension it was seen that a few Baha'is had achieved this station. Periodically Shoghi Effendi cabled or wrote National Assemblies the news that a certain outstanding teacher or administrator of the Cause had died. On rare occasions he would use such a communication to announce that this believer 'by sheer merit deserved to rank as one of the Hands of the Cause of God" or that the services of another believer 'entitled her to an eminent rank among the Hands of the 

Cause of Baha'u'llah      

 There were ten believers posthumously named Hands of the Cause by Shoghi Effendi. 

 The complete list is found in The Baha'i World, vol. XIV, pages 447 — 449, and includes: 1. Martha Root — 'that star-servant of the Cause of Baha'u'llah,' the 'foremost Hand which 'Abdu'l-Baha's will has raised up in the first Baha century.'3 2. Keith Ransom-Kehier-—  the 'first and distinguished' American martyr.4 

 3. Dr. John Esslemont — whom Shoghi Effendi called 'the warmest of friends, a trusted counsellor, an indefatigable collaborator, a lovable companion.'5 4. Louis Gregory — the 'nobleminded golden-hearted' believer who was 'loved admired and trusted by 'Abdu'l-Baha After 1951 when the first contingent of living Hands of the Cause was named there were no further posthumous appointments. 

Iv                         

 As 1953 approached the Guardian began to make plans for the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah's Revelation in the Siy4b-ChA1 that dark loathsome prison of Tihr6n. This called for a series of four International Conferences and the launching of an unprecedented teaching campaign that would establish the Faith throughout the world. This Ten Year Spiritual Crusade constituted one of ten stages of 'the plan wrought by God Himself for humanity' — a plan which began with Adam and which will culminate when 'the light of God's triumphant Faith shining in all its power and glory will have suffused and enveloped the entire planet.'7 

   This Spiritual Crusade     

 was to be a glorious enterprise and glorious were the events that led to its launching. Among these preparatory events was the announceMent, on 24 December  1951, of the first contingent of living Hands of the Cause of God. Those named were: 

Sutherland Maxwell, Mason  

 Remey, Amelia Collins, Valiyu'llAh VarqA, Tar~zu'1hh Samandari, 'Ali-Akbar Furfltan, 

Horace Holley, Dorothy     

 Baker, Leroy Joas, George Townshend, Flermann Grossmann, and 

Ugo Giachery. On 29 February

 1952 the twelve Hands were increased to nineteen with the nominations of Fred Schopflocher,

524                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  From the time of their appointments the Hands of the Cause were outstanding in helping to win the goals of the Ten Year Crusade in their respective continents. 

 In them the Faith also found leonine defenders and Shoghi Effendi once wrote how certain Hands had shared in 'administering a stunning defeat to the enemies of the Faith." 

 The protective function of the Hands of the Cause was further reenforced in October 1957 when the number of Hands was increased to twenty-seven. The Guardian said this body was 'one of the cardinal and pivotal institutions ordained by Baha'u'llah, and confirmed in the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha' He called the Hands of the Cause 'the Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth, who have been invested by the unerring Pen of the Center of His Covenant  with the dual function of guarding over the security, and of insuring the propagation of 

His Father's Faith.'      

 He wrote: 'The eight now elevated to this exalted rank are: 

Enoch Olinga, William     

 Sears, and John Robarts, in West and South Africa; 

Flasan Baha'i and John  
Ferraby in the British    

Isles; Collis Featherstone

 and Rahmatu'lhh MulPjir in the Pacific Area; and Abu'1-QAsim Faizf in the Arabian Peninsula — a group chosep from four continents  of the globe, and representing the AfnAn, as well as the black and white races and whose members are derived from Christian, 

Muslim, Jewish and Pagan  
backgrounds.             

 'This latest addition to the band of high-ranking officers of a fast evolving World Administrative Order, involving a further expansion of the august institution of the Prostrate with grief yet steadfast, overwhelmed with sorrow yet steadfast, the Hands of the Cause of God began the most extraordinary  period of their services. The reins of the Cause had suddenly been handed to its Chief Stewards. 

 It is to this period, spanning the last six years of the Ten Year Crusade, that the Universal House of Justice paid ibid., p. 31. ibid., pp. 127 — 128. 

 Hands of the Cause of God, calls for, in view of the recent assumption by them of their sacred responsibility as protectors of the Faith, the appointment by these same Hands, in each continent separately, of an additional Auxiliary Board, equal in membership to the existing one, and charged with the specific duty of watching over the security of the Faith, thereby complementing the function of the original Board, whose duty will henceforth be exclusively concerned with assisting the prosecution of the Ten-Year Plan.'2 The Ten Year Crusade was nearing its midpoint on a wave of unprecedented victories. The believers had pioneered throughout the world. They were raising the call of Yd-Bahd~u~l~Abhd* through all regions. 

 Translations  of the Writings were being made. Incorporations and legal recognitions of the Faith were being obtained. Baha'i Centers, local and national Uapratu'1-Quds were materializing.  It was a vibrant time. The air was electric. During his few moments of rest from the administration of the vast coitplexities of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi was hard at work on a beautiful map which gave expression to the joy and pride he felt for the believers. From every continent he drew colored arrows charting  accomplishments and from Haifa golden rays burst forth keyed to record the development of the World Center of the Faith. One gold ray was the recent appointment of additional Hands of the Cause. With an abruptness that stilled all things the hand of the beloved Guardian was withdrawn. 
He died in London on 4    

November 1957.            

  moving tribute: 'Following the passing of Shoghi Effendi the international administration of the Faith was carried on by the Hands of the Cause of God with the complete agreement  and loyalty of the national spiritual assemblies and the body of the believers. This was in accordance with the Guardian's * '0 Thou the Glory of Glories!', another form of the Greatest Name Alldh-u-Abhd.

          THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA' U' LLAH

  designation of the Hands as the "Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World 

Commonwealth."            

 'From the very outset of their custodianship of the Cause of God the Hands realized that since they had no certainty of Divine guidance such as is incontrovertibly assured to the Guardian and to the Universal  House of Justice, their one safe course was to follow with undeviating firmness the instructions and policies of Shoghi Effendi. The entire history of religion shows no comparable record of such strict self-disci-pline, such absolute loyalty, and such complete self-abnegation by the leaders of a religion finding themselves suddenly deprived of their divinely inspired guide. The debt of gratitude which mankind for generations, nay, ages to come, owes to this handful of grief-stricken, steadfast, heroic souls is beyond estimation." 

  For six years the Hands of the Cause guided the Baha'is with infinite tenderness and love. They for whom the loss of the Guardian was greatest gave the most to their fellow believers. On them descended, with all its fearful implications, the actuality of protecting the Faith when the storm of opposition to the Covenant of Baha'u'llah was again unleashed. Speaking at the Intercontinental Conference in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1958, the Hand of the Cause Amelia Collins said: 'We are all, in a way, Shoghi Effendi's heirs. 

 We have inherited his work. His plan is completely laid out. Ours is the task to fulfill it. We must, each of us, complete our share of the World Crusade. This is the memorial we must build to our beloved Shoghi Effendi. 

 'Let us love him more now than ever before, and through the power of our love attract his love to us, and bring his blessing on our labors.

 'Let us not fail him, for he never failed us. Let us never forget him, for be never forgot us.'2 The labors and sufferings of the Hands of the Cause were blessed. On 22 April 1963, from the

  With that beautiful cable an era in the work of the Hands of the Cause came to a close. Now their destiny was to be unfolded for them by this same Universal House of Justice. A new chapter in the evolution of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause was about to open. 

  the Universal House of Justice to insure its continuation into the future. How would this be done? In 

November 1964 the House   

 of 2 The Baha'i World, vol. XIII, p. 840.

  Justice announced: 'There is no way to appoint, or to legislate to make it possible to appoint, Hands of the Cause of God.' How then could this 'cardinal and pivotal' institution extend 'into the future its appointed functions of protection and propagation'? 

 The initial step was taken in November 1964 when the Hands were formally related to the House of Justice. Still assigned to specific continents, they were 'reinforced by a wider and more efficient organization of their work' through an increase in the number of Auxiliary Board members and the appointment of certain Board members to act in an executive capacity on behalf of each Hand.1 

 After much thought and study, after 'prolonged and. prayerful consultation between the Universal House of Justice and the Hands of the Cause of God', in June 1968 the Supreme Body announced the establishment of Continental 

Boards of Counselors       

 for the protection and propagation of the Faith. 

 The creation of this institution insured the extension into the future of the appointed functions of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause. The Hands of the Cause were released from administration of the Auxiliary Boards whose members now were appointed by and reported to the Continental Boards of Counselors. 

 'The Hands of the Cause of God,' wrote the Universal 

House of Justice, 'are     

 one of the most precious assets the Baha'i world possesses.'  The House of Justice looked forward to these appointees of the Guardian being able 'to concentrate their energies on the more primary responsibilities of general protection and propagation, "preservation of the spiritual health of the Baha'i communities" and "the vitality of the faith" of the Baha'is throughout the world.'2 The increased freedom  for the Hands to travel widely has had a profound effect on the progress of the Cause. At the conclusion of the Nine Year Plan, the Universal House of Justice wrote: 'They have, in all parts of the world, inspired the friends, assisted National Spiritual Assemblies, promoted  the teaching work and played a vital part in the success of the Plan. The lagging fortunes of more than one national community  have been revolutionized by a visit of a Hand of the Cause; swift and energetic action, Wellspring of Guidance, pp. 40 — 43.

 inspired by the Hand, has been followed by astonishing results, completely reversing that '3 community's prospects. 

 When the House of Justice announced the creation of the Continental Boards of Counselors  it alluded to the eventual establishment of an international teaching center at the World Center. 

 This teaching center had been foreshadowed in the writings of the beloved Guardian. The evolution of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause took a further step in June 1973 when the House of Justice announced:  'The time is indeed propitious for the establishment of the International Teaching  Center, a development which, at one and the same time, brings to fruition the work of the Hands of the Cause residing in the Irloiy Land and provides for its extension into the future, links the institution of the Boards of Counselors even more intimately with that of the Hands of the Cause of God, and powerfully reinforces the discharge of the rapidly growing responsibilities of the 

Universal House of Justice.'4

 All the Hands of the Cause are members of the International Teaching Center. Each Hand is kept informed of the activities of the Center, each conveys suggestions, recommendations and information to the Center, and when in the Holy Land, takes part in the consultations and activities of the Center. In addition, four believers with the rank of Counselor serve on this body. 
     In announcing the Seven    

Year Plan the Universal    

 House of Justice wrote: 'The Institution  of the Hands of the Cause of 

God, the Chief Stewards    

 of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth, is bearing a precious fruit in the development of the International Teaching Center as a mighty institution of the World Center of the Faith; an institution blessed by the membership of all the Hands of the Cause; an institution whose beneficent influence is diffused to all parts of the Baha'i community through the Continental Boards of Counselors, the members of the Auxiliary Boards and their assistants. 

 The marvel and wonder of the International Teaching Center is only beginning to unfold before us. It is a further evidence of the Messages:    1968 — 1973, p. 116.

  eternal legacy of the Hands of the Cause. In the future it will operate from that building on the arc on Mount Carmel designated by the Guardian as the Seat for the Hands of the Cause.1 

 The Universal House of Justice in writing about the Hands of the Cause of God, the Counselors and the members of the Auxiliary Boards, said that 'it is not incorrect to refer to the three ranks collectively as one institution.'2 It explained that the Auxiliary Boards were brought into being to assist the Hands, and they are now the 'assistants, deputies, and advisers' of the Continental Board of Counselors  for each respective area. The Continental  Boards of Counselors were brought into The Hands of the Cause of God are the standard-bearers. 

 They are the 'divinely appointed,  tried, and victorious sduls 'Their deeds are such as to eclipse the acts of the apostles of old and to confer eternal splendor on this period of the 

Formative Age.'6          

 What more can be said once the Universal House of Justice, freed from all error, has stated categorically that our debt of gratitude to them is beyond estimation?

 being to carry into the future the vital functions of protection and propagation vested in the Institution of the Hands of the Cause. 'However,' continued the Universal 

House of Justice, 'each   

 is also a separate institution in itself.' The House of Justice also has stated that 'Although the Counselors occupy a rank lower than that of the Hands of the Cause, they are nevertheless charged with the same two responsibilities and follow in the footsteps of the Hands of the Cause.'3 The Supreme Body in addition stated that the Hands of the Cause would 'nurture the new institution and function in close collaboration with it as long as possible.'4 'These few gallant and dedicated believers, whose place in history is forever assured by virtue of their appointment to their high office,' wrote the Universal House of Justice on another occasion, 'are indeed a precious legacy left to us by our beloved Guardian, and as the years go by there is increasingly added to the honor and respect which is their due by reason of their exalted rank, the love and admiration of the friends evoked by their '7 constant services.

           THE NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY

                   1. INTRODUCTION

  THE sacred Writings of the Baha Faith create organic institutions having a membership elected by the Baha'i community. 

 Baha'u'llah called these institutions into being; their establishment, definition, training and development came later, in the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha and in that of the Guardian appointed in 'Abdu'l-Baha's 

Testament.                 

 Since the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1921, the formation of Local Spiritual Assemblies has multiplied in East and West, and the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly has become firmly established. Concerning this national administrative body Shoghi Effendi has provided clear information and direction. Its purpose, its power, its responsibility and its functions and duties are definitely prescribed. 

 'Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by frequent personal consultations the manifold activities of the friends [believers] 

 as well as the Local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy Land Baha'i World Centre], 

 initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the Cause in that country. 

 'It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first in conjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world, to elect directly the members of the International House of Justice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the affairs of the [Faith] 
throughout the world.      

 '... it has to exercise full authority over all the Local Assemblies in its province, and will have to direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs of the [Faith] in general. 

 'Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly. 

 It will have to refer each of these questions to a special committee, to be elected by the mem bers of the National Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that country. 

 'With it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is strictly Local in its nature or whether it should fall under its own province and be regarded as a matter which ought to receive its special attention." 

 'The need for the centralization of authority in the National Spiritual Assembly, and the concentration of power in the various Local Assemblies, is manifest.'2 'The authority of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 is undivided and unchallengeable in all matters pertaining to the administration of the Faith [throughout its country].'3 The individual Baha has spiritual citizenship in a world community of believers acting through local, national and international bodies. 

 There is no division of interest or conflict of authority among these institutions, for ever since the ascension of 

Baha'u'llah in 1892 His    

 Faith has possessed infallible guidance  by virtue of His Covenant, which specifically provides it. The action of a Baha'i administrative body, therefore, while rationally  determined by constitutional principles, operates in a spiritual realm revealed by the Manifestation of God and maintained free from political pressure and the influence of materialism. 

 Apart from the appointed Interpreter, no Baha'i has individual authority. Decisions are confined to the sphere of action and are made by a body of nine persons. 

 The advice and direction clarifying the nature and operation of a National Spiritual Assembly have been compiled by the American  Baha'is from letters written to them by Shoghi Effendi'

<p537>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH  537

  During the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha, after He had approved the petition submitted to Him by the American Baha'is expressing their desire to construct.a House of Worship, these Baha'is formed a national body known as Baha'i Temple Unity, incorporated for the purpose of gathering funds and coordinating plans to erect the Temple in Wilmette. That body, though national in scope and elected by delegates representing the various local Baha'i communities, was not a National Spiritual Assembly. 

 It is interesting to note that in Baha Temple 

Unity the American Baha'is 

 established  a body reflecting their own national historical experience. The local communities preceded the national body in time and each exercised an independent authority in the conduct of its own affairs. When their representatives agreed to form a national Baha'i body with full jurisdiction over Temple matters, they transferred  to it powers which vested final decision, not in its directors, but in the Annual Convention. 

 The vital distinction between Temple Unity and the National Spiritual Assembly when later establiThed lay in this field of ultimate  authority. The 

National Spiritual Assembly 

 possessed original authority, powers and functions of its own. It came into existence through election of its nine members at a National Convention but constituted a continuing authority derived from the Baha teachings and not conferred by any action of the believers, whether as local communities or as delegates. This authority emerged supreme in relation to Baha'i matters within the national community but subject to the higher authority of the Guardian and also of the future International 

House of Justice.1         
     Within its own realm the   

National Spiritual Assembly

 is an institution created by the Teachings of the Faith independent of the Baha'u'llah electits members and oftheBah6'is composing its membership. In no way does this institution reflect either the political or the ecclesiastical influences of its environment, whether in America, Europe or the East. This fact has paramount importance. 

 On the one hand it reveals the existence of an organic religious society; on the other hand it demonstrates the freedom of this new community Written in 1954. 

 from the legalisms and devices acting within every human institution. 

 While the transition from Baha'i Temple Unity to 

National Spiritual Assembly

 in North America emphasizes certain principles inherent in Baha'i institutions, the formation of a National Spiritual Assembly in a new area represents more profoundly the creation of a new type of society. 

Every national Baha'i      

 community  has gone through some evolution reflecting its historical background before its National Assembly was established. 

 The functions of a National Spiritual Assembly are manifold: the publication of Baha'i literature; national teaching plans; supervision of local communities; encouragement  and direction of all the Baha'is in their service to the Faith; and representation of the Baha'is in relation to the civil authorities. 

 Each national body prepares and adopts its own constitution, formulated on the basis of the model approved by the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. All the 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 collectively,  under the title of the Baha'i International Community, constitute an international nongovernmental organization whose delegates are accredited by United Nations for attendance and participation in its regional conferences.2 

 Through the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly, Baha'is are enabled to carry out plans of considerable magnitude, collaborate  with Baha'is of all other lands in matters  of international interest, maintain common standards of administrative principle, and take advantage, in the appointment of committees,  of particular talents and aptitudes possessed  by individual believers. The National Spiritual Assembly stands as one of the pillars supporting the Baha'i world community. 

 Participation  in national Baha'i activities serves to insulate the individual Baha'i from infection by the psychic ills which afflict modern society as a result of its lack of faith and spiritual direction. Within the shelter of this emerging order the storms of partisanship cannot engulf the soul.

  2. A MODEL DECLARATION OF TRUST
          AND BYLAWS
                                 for a

     NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY

                      FOREWORD

  THE 1926 — 27 National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada completed a task which, while pertaining to the outer and more material aspects of the Cause, nevertheless has a special significance for its spirit and inward sacred purpose. This task consisted in creating a legal form. which gives proper substance and substantial character to the National Spiritual Assemblies and the administrative processes embodied in the Baha'i teachings by a form of incorporation recognized under common law. This Declaration of Trust, with its attendant ByLaws, became the model to be followed, with adaptations as local laws and circumstances required, by other National Spiritual Assemblies. The years following the election of the Universal l House of Justice witnessed a great increase in the number of National Spiritual Assemblies (from 57 in 1963 to 135 by RiQv~n 1983) and the House of Justice itself provided a model document, largely based on the one devised by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, to be followed as closely as possible by all new National Spiritual Assemblies as they became incorporated, which they were required to do under the Nine Year Plan. 

 Careful examination of the Declaration and its ByLaws will reveal the fact that this document contains no arbitrary elements nor features new to the Baha'i Cause. On the contrary, it represents a most conscientious effort to reflect those very administrative principles and elements already set forth in the letters of the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, and already determining the methods and relationships of Baha'i collective association. The provision both in the Declaration and in the ByLaws for amendments in the future will permit the National Spiritual Assemblies to adapt this document to such new administrative elements or principles as may at any time be given forth. The Declaration, in fact, is nothing more nor, less than a legal parallel of those moral and spiritual laws of unity inherent in the fullness of the BaWi'f Revelation and making it the fulfilment of the ideal of religion in the social as well as spiritual realm. Because, in the Baha'i Faith, this perfect correspondence exists between spiritual and social laws, the Baha'is believe thatadniini-strative e success is identical with moral success, and that nothing less than the true Baha'i spirit of devotion and sacrifice can inspire with effective power the worldWide body of unity revealed by 

Baha'u'llah.

                     ARTICLE IX

  Where the National Spiritual Assembly has been given in these ByLaws exclusive and final jurisdiction, and paramount executive authority, in all matters pertaining to the activities and affairs of the Baha'i Cause in    it is understood that any decision made or action taken upon such matters shall be subject in every instance to ultimate review and approval by the Universal 

House of Justice.

                      ARTICLE X

  Whatever functions and powers are not specifically attributable to Local Spiritual Assemblies in these ByLaws shall be considered vested in the National Spiritual Assembly, which body is authorized to delegate such discretionary functions and powers as it deems necessary and advisable to the Local Spiritual Assemblies within its jurisdiction. 

                     ARTICLE XI

  In order to preserve the spiritual character and purpose of Baha elections, the practice of nominations or any other electoral method detrimental to a silent and prayerful election shall not prevail, so that each elector may vote for none but those whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold. 

 Among the most outstanding and sacred duties incumbent upon those who have been called upon to initiate, direct and coordinate the affairs of the Cause as members of Local or National Spiritual Assemblies are: To win by every means in their power the confidence and affection of those whom it is their privilege to serve; to investigate and acquaint themselves with the considered views, the prevailing g sentiments and the personal convictions of those whose welfare it is their solemn obligation to promote; to purge their deliberations and the general conduct of their affairs of selfcontained aloofness, the suspicion of secrecy, the stifling atmosphere of dictatorial assertiveness and of every word and deed that may savour of partiality, seif-centredness and prejudice; and while retaining the sacred right of final decision in their hands, to invite discussion, ventilate grievances, , welcome advice and foster the sense of interdependence and copartnership, of understanding g and mutual confidence between themselves and all other Baha'is.

     Annual Committee Reports:  

 These are to be considered as part of the report of the National Spiritual Assembly. They are whenever possible  published inBahd'f News in advance of the Convention date, for the information of the delegates. 

    Subjects for Consultation: 

 Any delegate may, before the Convention convenes, recommend to the National Assembly such topics as he deems of sufficient importance to be included in the Convention agenda; and the National Spiritual Assembly, from the list of topics received from delegates, and also suggested by its own knowledge and experience, is to prepare an agenda or order of business as its recommendation to the Convention. 

 This agenda may include, as part of the National Assembly's annual report, the presentation  of special subjects by well qualified members, committee representatives or non-Bah6'i  experts whose exposition is necessary or desirable for the information of the delegates. 

 On motion duly made, seconded and voted, any such subject may be omitted, and also on motion duly made, seconded and voted, any other subject may be proposed for special consultation. 

 Annual Election: The election of members of the National Spiritual Assembly is to take place approximately midway during the Convention sessions, so as to enable the delegates to consult with both the outgoing and incoming Assemblies, in accordance with the Guardian's expressed desire. 

  Con duct of Business Every deliberative body, to fulfil its functions, must conduct its deliberations in accordance  with some established rules of order. The parliamentary procedure here set forth for the Convention is based upon the procedure already adopted for meetings of Local Assemblies and communities. It accordingly extends to sessions of the AnnuM Convention, the same procedure under which the delegates, in their other Baha'i activities, are accustomed to conduct discussions and consultation. 

 The purpose of consultation at the Annual Convention is threefold: to arrive at full and complete knowledge of the current conditions, problems and possibilities of the Faith in America; to give the incoming National Assembly the benefit of the collective wisdom, guidance and constructive suggestions of the assembled delegates, and to contribute to the unity, in spirit and in action, of the entire American Baha'i community. 

 The freedom of each and every delegate to take part in discussion and to initiate motions is untrammelled save as the undue activity of one delegate might hamper the rights of the other delegates. Any necessary limitation to be placed upon individual discussion shall be determined by the Chairman in the absence of any specific motion duly voted by the delegates themselves.


<p547>
547

           THE WORLD ORDER OF J3AHA'U'LLAH

  It shall be the duty of the Chairman to encourage general consultation and make possible the active participation of the greatest possible number of delegates. 

 The Chairman has the same power and responsibility for discussion and voting upon motions as other delegates. Members of the outgoing and incoming National Assembly who are not delegates may participate in the consultation but not vote. 

 A resolution, or motion, is not subject to discussion or vote until duly made and seconded.  It is preferable to have each resolution clear and complete in itself, but when an amendment is duly made and seconded, the Chairman shall call for a vote on the amendment first and then on the motion. An amendment must be relevant to, and not contravene, the subject matter of the motion. 

 The Chairman shall call for votes by oral expression of ayes and nays, but where the result of the vote is doubtful then by a show of hands or a rising vote. A majority vote determines. 

 Discussion of any matter may be terminated by motion duly made, seconded and voted, calling upon the Chairman to bring the matter to an immediate vote or proceed to other business. 

 The transactions of the Convention shall be recorded by the Secretary, and when certified by the Convention officers shall be given to the National 

Spiritual Assembly.        
                           
Annual Election

Spiritual Assembly. Ballots

 and tellers' report forms shall be provided by the National 

Assembly.                  

 The election shall be conducted by the Convention, but delegates unable to attend the Convention shall have the right to vote by mail. 

 The Chairman shall appoint three tellers, chosen from among the assembled delegates. 

 The electoral method shall be as follows: 

     1. The Convention Secretary

 shall call the roll of delegates, whereupon each delegate, in turn, shall place his or her ballot in a ballot box; and as the names are called ballots received by mail shall be placed in the ballot box by the Secretary of the National Assembly. 

  2. The ballot box shall then be handed to the tellers, who shall retire from the Convention hail to determine the result of the election. 

 3. The result of the election is to be reported by the tellers, and the tellers' report is to be approved by the Convention. 

 4. The ballots, together with the tellers' report, certified by all the tellers, are to be given to the National Spiritual Assembly for preservation.

<p554>
THE LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY1

       1. THE INSTITUTION AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE

  THE institution of the Spiritual Assembly was created by Baha'u'llah and is an integral part of His Revelation, together with the teachings,  principles, supplications, truth, and laws written in the 

Books and Tablets. It      

 is the foundation stone of the new World Order, the establishment of which is the essential aim of the Baha'i Faith. Through the loyalty of the believers who assist in the unfoldment of its latent attributes and powers, divine guidance and reinforcement is promised, and the forces of unity, justice, affection and fellowship are made to prevail over the negative elements which prey upon and destroy the civilization of an unbelieving age. 

 ...     To it (Local Assembly) all local matters pertaining to the Cause must be directly and immediately referred for full consultation and decision. The importance, nay the absolute necessity of these Local Assemblies is manifest when we realize that in the days to come they will evolve into tlie local House of Justice, and at present provide the firm foundation on which the structure of the Master's Will is to be reared in future.' B.A., p. 37. 

 'In order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not fall a prey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its purity and pristine vigour, that its affairs may be conducted  with efficiency and promptness, it is necessary that every one should conscientiously  take an active part in the election of these Assemblies, abide by their decisions, enforce their decree, and cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task of stimulating the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. 

 The members of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly their own likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and concentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce to the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i community and promote the common weal.' B.A., p. 41. 

 'From The Baha'i Community, Baha'i Publishing Trust, Wilmette, 1963. 

Formation of a Local Spiritual
Assembly                   

 When the requisite conditions exist, the local group of Baha'is is obligated to establish an Assembly. 

 It is not an optional matter. 

 The requisite conditions are simple. They include the following: 1. There must be nine or more adult Baha'is in good standing resident in the community. 

 2. These Baha'is are to be declared and recognized believers, all meeting qualifications of faith laid down by the Guardian. 

 If one or more members of the group are such newly-confirmed  Baha'is that they are not yet recorded as believers by the National Spiritual Assembly, these new believers are to take a full part in the formation of the Assembly, subject to later determination of their Baha'i status. 

    3. Each Local Assembly     
has a definite area of jurisdiction.

 Inmost cases the area is that of the civil boundaries of an incorporated village, town or city. An Assembly may also be formed by nine or more Baha'is who reside in the same township or county or unincorporated village. 

 Where the area of jurisdiction is a township, there must be nine or more adult Baha'is resident  therein outside the limits of any incorporated  town or city in the township, as each Baha'i civil area must be separate and distinct from other areas where an Assembly might later be formed. 

 Where the area of jurisdiction is a county, the county itself must be small enough to permit  all the believers to meet regularly. The county unit constitutes a Baha'i area of jurisdiction only when in it there are nine or more Baha'is who have access to no smaller civil area such as township or permanent electoral district.  Postal areas and school districts do not represent areas of jurisdiction for Baha'i Assemblies. 

 4. At the present time there is only one date when Local Assemblies can be formed — April 21 of any year. As the Baha'i calendar consists of days which begin and end at sunset rather than midnight, the time to form an Assembly is 554


<p555>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH   555

  after sunset on April 20 and before sunset on April 21 except in special circumstances. 

 5. Where there are more than nine adult Baha'is, they form an Assembly by electing the nine members of the Spiritual Assembly. Where there are exactly nine adult B ahA'is, they establish an Assembly by joint declaration, and all nine members must participate. 

The National Spiritual    

 Assembly provides different types of report forms for these two methods and the group should apply for the proper form in advance. 

 (For further information refer to the following section on 'The Annual 

Election and Organization.')

  The Annual Election and 

Organization              
    'These Local Spiritual    

 Assemblies will have to be elected directly by the friends, and every declared believer of 21 years and above, far from standing aloof and assuming an indifferent  or independent attitude, should regard it his sacred duty to take part conscientiously and diligently, in the election, the consolidation and the efficient working of his own Local Assembly.' 
B.A., p. 39.              

 'Pending its (the Universal House of Justice) establishment,' and to ensure uniformity throughout the East and throughout the West, all Local Assemblies will have to be reelected once a year, during the first day of Ridvan, and the result of polling, if possible, be declared on that day.' B.A., p. 41. 

 The annual meeting on April 21, called for the election of the Spiritual Assembly, provides  the occasion for the presentation. 

 of annual reports by the Assembly and by all its committees. 

 The chairman of the outgoing Assembly presides at this meeting. 

  The order of business includes: Reading of the call of the meeting Reading of appropriate Baha'i passages bearing upon the subject of the election Appointment of tellers Distribution of ballots Prayers for the spiritual guidance of the voters The election by secret ballot Presentation of annual reports Tellers' report of the election Approval of the tellers' report Written in 1923. 

 Assembly members are elected by plurality vote. The believers receiving the nine highest votes on the first ballot are elected, unless two or more are tied for ninth place. In case of a tie, a second ballot is cast by those present, and on this ballot the voter is to write the name of one of those who are tied in the first ballot. 

 Contrary to the ways of the world, Baha'i elections are approached in a spirit of prayer without preliminary electioneering or nominating of candidates. Before the ballots are cast prayers should be read and all participating ask for guidance in selecting those best fitted to serve. 

 In this regard the Guardian wrote: .... Let us recall His ['Abdu'1-BahA's] explicit and often-repeated assurances that every Assembly elected in that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness and detachment is, in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and with cheerfulness.' 
B.A., p. 65.              

 the elector.., is called upon to vote for none but those whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold. Moreover, the practice of nomination, so detrimental to the atmosphere of a silent and prayerful election, is viewed with mistrust. Should this simple system  (based on plurality) be provisionally adopted, it would safeguard the spiritual principle  of the unfettered freedom of the voter who will thus preserve intact the sanctity of the choice he first made .' BA., 
p. 136.                   

 'The newly-elected Assembly is call~d together  by the believer who received the highest number of votes, or in case two or more members  have received the same said highest number of votes, then by the member selected by lot from among those members; and this member shall preside until the permanent chairman is chosen.' ByLaws of a Local Spiritual Assembly, Art, VIII. 

 It is preferable to have the election of the officers of the Assembly immediately following the annual election or formation by joint declaration;  however, all nine members of the Assembly must be given an opportunity to vote for the officers. 

 In rare instances a meeting for the election of officers cannot be called because of inability on the part of one or more members to attend. In such cases, the best procedure  is to elect or appoint immediately a temporary chairman and secretary to serve until such time as all members of the Assembly


<p556>
556                THE BAHA WORLD

  can be present to vote in person. 

 Permanent officers are elected by secret ballot and by majority rather than by plurality vote. 

 (Plurality is the largest number; majority is the number greater than half, which, in this case, is at least five out of the nine.) 

 When an Assembly is organized, it is to report its formation and election of officers to the National Spiritual Assembly, together with whatever relevant facts may be necessary for recognition of the Assembly. 
                           
Dissolution of a Local     
Spiritual Assembly         

 Once elected or formed by joint declaration, an Assembly continues to exist until the next annual election or until the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 acts to declare the Assembly dissolved.  This decision is not to be made by the members of the Local Assembly itself nor by any regional or national committee. 

 If the number of adult Baha'is in the community becomes less than nine, or other conditions  arise which make it impossible for the Local Assembly to function, the facts should be reported to the National Assembly for final determination of the status of the 

Assembly.                  
                           
Authority and Functions    
   The Local Spiritual Assemblies

 are 'invested with an authority rendering them unanswerable  for their acts and decisions to those who elect them; solemnly pledged to follow, under all conditions, the dictates of the "Most Great Justice" that can alone usher in the reign of the "Most Great Peace" which Baha'u'llah has proclaimed and must ultimately establish; charged with the responsibility of promoting at all times the best interests of the communities within their jurisdiction, of familiarizing them with their plans and activities and of inviting them to offer any recommendations they might wish to make; cognizant of their no less vital task of demonstrating, through association with all liberal and humanitarian movements, the universality and comprehensiveness of their Faith; dissociated entirely from all sectarian organizations, whether religious or secular; assisted by committees annually appointed by, and directly responsible to them, to each of which a particular branch of Baha'i activity is assigned for study and action; supported by local funds to which all believers voluntarily contribute...' 
G.P.B., p. 331.            

 The various functions of the Local Spiritual Assembly, and its nature as a constitutional body, are duly set forth in Article VII of the ByLaws of the National Spiritual Assembly, and more definitely defined in the ByLaws of a Local Spiritual Assembly approved by the National Spiritual Assembly as recommended by the Guardian. 

Each Local Spiritual       

 Assembly  of the United States, whether or not legally incorporated, is to function according to those ByLaws, and all members of the local Baha'i community shall be guided and controlled by their provisions. 

 An essential function of Local Spiritual Assemblies is to act as intermediaries between the local communities and the National Spiritual 

Assembly. The Local Assembly

 is, therefore, the proper medium through which local Baha'i communities can communicate with the body of their national representatives. 
                           
Appointment of Committees  

 In the appointment of committees, only those committees needed to carry out the activities of the community are necessary. Such committees are appointed by the Assembly from among the entire membership of the community, have specific functions to perform, and are responsible to the Assembly who will exercise constant and general supervision over their work. Before making appointments, it is usually beneficial to discuss the special abilities, aptitudes and personal wishes of the members under consideration in relation to the tasks which are to be performed by the committees. 
                           
Meetings                   

 A meeting of the Spiritual Assembly is valid only when it has been duly called, that is, when each and every member has been informed of the time and place. The general practice is for the Assembly to decide upon some regular time and place for its meeting throughout the Baha'i year, and this decision when recorded in the minutes is sufficient notice to the members. When the regular schedule cannot be followed, or the need arises for a special meeting, the secretary, on request of the chairman, or, in his absence or incapacity, of the vice-chairman, or of any three members of the Assembly, should send due notice to all the members. 

 The procedure for the calling of the Annual


<p557>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH  557

  Meeting is outlined in Article XI of the ByLaws of a Local Spiritual 

Assembly.                  
                           
Prime Requisites           

 The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and longsuffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted Threshold. 

 Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be vouchsafed  to them. 

 In this day, assemblies of consultation  are of the greatest importance and a vital necessity. 

 Obedience unto them is essential and obligatory. 
BA., p. 21.                

 The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of the Assembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be nonexistent, the gathering shallbedispersedandthatAssembly be brought to naught. 

 The second condition: — They must when coming together turn their faces to the Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory. They must dzen proceed with the utmost devotion,  courtesy, dignity, care and moderation to express their views. They must in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. The honoured members must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion arise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to the majority. 

 It is again not permitted that any one of the honoured members object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, a~iy decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for such criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. 

 In short, whatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and purity of motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement prevajithe result shall be darkness upon darkness ... If this be so regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One. Should they endeavour to fulfil these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become the centre of Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of spirit. 'Abdu'l-Baha. BA., 
pp. 22 — 23.                 

  Recommended Agenda and 

Procedure                  

 Since order is an important characteristic of the 

Baha'i Faith, Baha'is       

 should conduct their business in an orderly manner. 

 The following agenda is suggested for meetings of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly:                  
Prayer.                    

 Reading and approval of minutes of previous meeting. 

 Report of Secretary (or Corresponding Secretary) including correspondence of interest and concern to the body of the believers, and any and all recommendations duly adopted by the community at the last Nineteen Day 

Feast.                     
 Report of Treasurer.       
 Report of Committees.      
 Unlinished business.       

 New business, including conferences with members of the community and with applicants for enrolment as members of the community. 
Closing prayer.            

  A Spiritual Assembly in maintaining its threefold function of a body given (within the limits of its jurisdiction) an executive, a legislative and a judicial capacity, is charged with responsibilities for initiating action and making decisions. 

 Its meetings, therefore, revolve around various definite matters which require deliberation and collective decision, and it is incumbent upon the members, one and all, to address themselves to the chairman on the subject  under discussion and not introduce matters irrelevant to the subject. 

 Baha'i principles of consultation and majority  rule are requisite characteristics in Baha'i Administration, and represent radical departures  from the generally accepted rules of parliamentary procedure. In Baha'i Assembly action, the chairman takes part in the discussion, and a majority decision becomes unani


<p558>
558                THE HAHAf WORLD

  mous and binding upon all. There is no minority opinion in Baha Administration; the decision  of the majority is the decision of all. 

 Every subject or problem before an Assembly  is most efficiently handled when the following  process is observed: First, ascertainment and agreement upon the facts; Second, agreement upon the spiritual or adminstrative principle which is involved; Third, full and frank discussion of the matter, leading up to the offering of a resolution; and Fourth, voting upon the resolution. 

 A resolution, or motion, is not subject to discussion or vote until duly made and seconded.  It is preferable to have such resolution clear and complete in itself, but when an amendment is duly made and seconded, the chairman shall call for a vote on the amendment first and then on the original motion. An amendment must be relevant to, and not contravene,  the subject matter of the motion. Only one motion should be considered at a time. The procedure for handling motions is: 1.  Statement of motion 

  2.  Second                 
  3.  Discussion of the motion

  4.  Voting                 

 5.  Announcement of the result of the voting. 

 Amendments are to be voted on before the main motion. 

 Motions can be amended only once, by one of the following actions: adding, striking out, inserting, striking out and inserting,  substituting, dividing. 

 An action may be agreed upon by the Assembly without going through the formality of making a motion and voting upon it; however,  if the agreement is not unanimous the question must be put to a vote. 

 The chairman, or other presiding officer, has the same right and responsibility as other members of the Assembly for discussing and voting upon all matters being considered by the Assembly. 

 Discussion of any subject before the Assembly  may be terminated by a motion duly made, seconded and voted, calling upon the chairman to put the matter to a vote or to proceed to the next matter on the agenda. The purpose of this procedure is to prevent any member or members  from unnecessarily prolonging the discussion beyond the point at which full opportunity has been given to all members to express their views. 

 A motion to adjourn is always in order and has priority over all other motions except the motion to fix the time of the next meeting. The motion to adjourn is not debatable and cannot be amended. 

 It requires a majority vote. Before voting, however, the presiding officer should point out items of unfinished business on the agenda, so that the members will know whether to vote for or against adjournment at that moment. 

 A motion may be withdrawn by the mover, provided no one objects, and before a vote has been taken. 

 When the Assembly has taken action upon any matter, the action is binding upon all members, whether present or absent from the meeting at which the action was taken. 

 Individual  views and opinions must be subordinated to the will of the Assembly when a decision  has been made. A Spiritual Assembly is an administrative unit, as it is a spiritual unit, and therefore no distinction between 'majority' and 'minority' groups or factions can be recognized. 

 Each member must give undivided ioy-alty  to the institution to which he or she has been elected. 

 Any action taken by the Assembly can be reconsid&red at a later meeting, on motion duly made, seconded and carried. This reconsideration, according to the result of the consUltation, may lead to a revision or the annulment of the prior action. If a majority is unwilling to reconsider the prior action, further discussion of the matter by any member is improper. 
                           
Vacancies on Assembly      

 The Assembly has a responsibility in filling a vacancy caused by the inability of any member to attend the meetings. 

 'It is only too obvious that unless a member can attend regularly the meetings of his Local Assembly, it would be impossible for him to discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfil his responsibilities  as a representative of the community. Membership in a Local Spiritual Assembly carries  with it, indeed, the obligation and capacity to remain in close touch with local Baha'i activities, and ability to attend regularly the sessions of the Assembly.' 

 Letter from Shoghi Effendi, 16 Feb. 1935. 

 When a vacancy on an Assembly involves


<p559>
TIlE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH   559

  also one of its officers, the Assembly vacancy is filled in the usual manner by election at a special  meeting of the local Baha'i community, after which the entire Assembly elects the new officer. 
                           
Minutes                    

 The Spiritual Assembly, as a permanent body, is responsible for maintaining all minutes of its meetings, important records and correspondence,  and financial records throughout its existence as a Baha'i institution. 

 Each officer, therefore, on completing his or her term of office, shall turn over to the Assembly all records and files pertaining to the business of the Assembly. A permanent record of minutes is of special importance and necessity when an Assembly is incorporated, because situations could arise which would make it necessary to produce the minutes for inspection by state authorities. 

 Other items which would be of historical interest in the future should be kept in the local archives. 

 It is vitally important that each Local Spiritual Assembly maintain a complete file of Baha'( News and the U.S. Supplement for reference on various directives regarding laws and procedures, teaching suggestions, and other pertinent information. 

 It should also maintain and keep up to date a file of all special instructions and statements from the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 dealing with matters of permanent value. 

 Minutes are the permanent official record of the meeting taken by a secretary. 

 If the community  is large and the Assembly handles a great amountof business, a recording secretary may be elected to record the minutes. The minutes should include all essential details, such as the election of the Assembly and its officers at the beginning of each year, by-elections  for filling vacancies on the Assembly occurring during the year, attendance of all members at its meetings, new enrolments and transfers, marriages and deaths. 

 All carried motions are recorded in the minutes. 

 The minutes should be written in such a way as to provide sufficient background to understand the reason for the motions and decision, but the entire discussion does not need to be recorded. 

 It is not necessary to record names of individuals making and sec onding motions or making comments during the discussion. 

 Names are of importance, however,  when the minutes record reports given on special assignments or situations, or when assignments are given to particular individuals. 

 If a decision is adopted by common consent without the formality of a motion, even this decision should be clearly stated by the chairman  and recorded in the minutes so that there is no question as to what action was agreed upon by the group. 

 Correspondence should be listed in the minutes. 

 Copies of important outgoing correspondence,  in addition to the incoming letters, should be kept for the files. 

 Record should be made in the minutes of consultation with individuals meeting with the Assembly, whether requested by the individual or the Assembly. 

 Minutes should be written or typed legibly. They should be corrected and approved by the Assembly before they become a matter of permanent record. 

     Records of Nineteen-Day    

 Feasts need include only the recommendations made by the community to be presented to the Local Spiritual Assembly, with the background necessary for understanding them. 

 Minutes of Assembly meetings are not read at the Nineteen-Day Feasts; only the actions taken by the Assembly which concern the community affairs are reported at Feasts. The judgement of what should be shared at the Feasts belongs to the Local Spiritual 

Assembly.                 
                           
Legal Incorporation        

 Local Assemblies having fifteen or more active adult believers in the community are authorized to effect legal incorporation. 

 To do so the matter should be presented at a Nineteen-Day Feast and a recommendation adopted which expresses the desire of the community that the Spiritual Assembly be legally  incorporated. 

 The Baha'( World volumes reproduce many local Certificates of Incorporation which supply  models for consideration by the Assembly's attorney. 

 What is incorporated is the Spiritual Assembly, not the entire community. 

 The community is associated with the instrument through the annual election of the Local Assembly and the Spiritual Assembly's author

  ity to eprol new believers and determine the membership list, 

     The Articles of Incorporation

 are to make proper reference to the Central Figures of the Faith and to the 

National Spiritual Assembly. If

 necessary, the National Assembly on request will provide an example of how this is to be done. 

     Before the Incorporation   

 papers are recorded, a copy is to be sent to the National Spiritual Assembly for final approval. 

 After recording, three photostatic copies of the recorded Articles are to be sent to the National Spiritual Assembly, together with a photograph of the nine Assembly members. 

 Incorporation must be preserved in accordance with the manner prescribed by state law. 
                           
  THE NINETEEN-DAY FEAST     

  The institution of the Nineteen-Day Feast provides the recognized and regular occasion for general consultation on the part of the community, and for consultation between the Spiritual Assembly and the members of the community. The conduct of the period of consultation  at Nineteen-Day Feasts is a vital function of each Spiritual Assembly. 
   From words of 'Abdu'l-Baha:

The Nineteen-Day Feast     

 was inaugurated by the Bab and ratified by Baha'u'llah, in His Holy Book, the Aqdas, so that people may gather together and outwardly show fellowship and love, that the Divine mysteries may be disclosed. The object is concord, that through this fellowship hearts may become perfectly united, and reciprocity and mutual helpfulness be established.  Because the members of the world of humanity are unable to exist without being banded together, cooperation and helpfulness is the basis of human society. 

 Without the realization of these two great principles no great movement is pressed forward. B.W., Vol. XII, p.  298. 

      The Nineteen-Day Feast     

 has been described by the Guardian as the foundation of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. It is to be conducted  according to the following programme: the first part, entirely spiritual in character, is devoted to the reading of Baha'i prayers and selections from the Baha'i sacred Writings; the second part consists of general consultation on the affairs of the Cause; the third part is the material feast and social meeting of all the believers, and should maintain the spiritual nature of the 

Feast.                     

 In selecting the readings for the devotional part of the Feast the friends may be guided by the instructions printed in Bahd'(News quoting the following excerpt from a letter to a believer from the Guardian through his assistant secretary  dated 

27 April 1956, 'The Writings

 of the Mb and Baha'u'llah can certainly be read at any time at any place; likewise the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha are read freely during the spiritual part of the Feast. The Guardian has instructed that during the spiritual part of the Feast, his own writings should not be read. In other words, during the spiritual part of the Feast, readings should be confined to the Writings  of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and to a lesser extent, of the Master; but during that part of the Feast the Guardian's writings should not be read. During the. 

 period of administrative discussion  of the Feast, then the Guardian's writings may be read. Of course, during the administrative part of the Feast there can be no objection to the reading of the Writings of the Bab, Baha'u'llah or 'Abdu'l-Baha.' Baha'( News, Jan. 1959. 

 Baha'is should regard this Feast as the very heart of their spiritual activity, their participation  in the mystery of the holy utterance, their steadfast unity one with another in a universality  raised high above the limitations of race, class, nationality, sect, and personality, and their privilege of contributing to the power of the Cause in the realm of collective action. 
                           
Attendance                 

 Only members of the Baha'i community and visiting Baha'is from other localities may attend these meetings. 

 Young people between fifteen and twenty-one years of age, who have declared their acceptance of the qualifications of membership in the Faith are considered as members although they are referred to as Baha'i youth. 

 Children up to age fifteen, of Baha'i parents, may also attend the Nineteen-Day Feasts. 

 Regular attendance at the Nineteen-Day Feast is incumbent upon every Baha'i, illness or absence from the city being the only justification for absence. Believers are expected to arrange their personal affairs so as to enable them to observe the Baha'i calendar.


<p561>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH  561

  Order of Business for the Consultation Period The chairman or other appointed representative  of the Spiritual Assembly presides dur-lug  the period of consultation. 

   The Spiritual Assembly    

 reports to the community whatever communications have been received from the World Centre and the National Spiritual Assembly, as well as other correspondence of concern to all believers of the community. This does not necessarily mean that all communications must be read in full at the Feast. 

 A matter of vital importance at this meeting is consideration of national and international Baha'i affairs, to strengthen the capacity of the community to cooperate in promotion of the larger Baha'i interests and to deepen the understanding of all believers concerning the relation of the local community to the Baha'i world community. 

 The Assembly likewise reports its own activities and plans, including committee appointments that may have been made since the last Feast, the financial report, arrangements  made for public meetings, and in general shares with the community all matters that concern the Faith. 

 These reports are to be followed  by general consultation. 

 Provision is to be made for reports from committees, with discussion of each report. 

 The meeting is to be open for suggestions and recommendations from individual believers to the Local Spiritual Assembly on any matter affecting the Cause. 

 Such recommendations must be adopted by majority vote of the community members present before constituting  a resolution to be considered by the 

Local Spiritual Assembly. 

 Through this means individual Baha'is find in the Nineteen-Day Feast the channel through which hi make suggestions and recommendations  to the 

National Spiritual Assembly. These

 recommendations are offered first to the local community, and when adopted by the community come before the Local Assembly, which then may in its discretion forward the recommendations to the National Spiritual Assembly accompanied by its own considered view. 

 Upon each member of the community lies the obligation to make his or her utmost contribution  to the consultation, the ideal being a gathering of Baha'is inspired with one spirit and concentrating upon the one aim to further the interests of the Faith. 

 Baha'i visitors attending a Feast do not take part in the consultation of the community unless invited to do so. The secretary of the Assembly records each resolution adopted by the community, as well as the various suggestions advanced during the meeting, in order to report these to the Spiritual Assembly for its consideration. Whatever action the Assembly takes is to be reported at a later Nineteen-Day feast. 

 It should be borne in mind that the consult a-tion  period of the Nineteen-Day Feast is not the time for the Local Spiritual Assembly to consult and make decisions. 

 Matters of a personal nature should be brought to the Spiritual Assembly and not to the community at the Nineteen-Day Feast. Concerning the attitude with which believers should come to these Fea~ts, the Master has said, You must free yourselves from everything that is in your hearts, before you enter. 
                          
       CONSULTATION              

  In this Cause, consultation is of vital importance, but spiritual conference and not the mere voicing of personal views is intended Antagonism and contradiction are unfortunate and always destructive to truth. 

 The purpose is to emphasize the statement that consultation must have for its object the investigation of truth. 

 He who expresses an opinion should not voice it as correct and right but set it forth as a contribution to the consensus of eipinion, for the light of reality becomes apparent when two opinions coincide. 

 ... 'Abdu'l-Baha. P.U.P., p.  72. 

 'The principle of consultation, which constitutes  one of the basic laws of the Administration,  should be applied to all Baha activities which affect the collective interests of the Faith for it is through cooperation and continued exchange of thoughts and views that the Cause can best safeguard and foster its interests. Individual initiative, personal ability and resourcefulness, though indispensible, are, unless supported and enriched by the collective experience  and wisdom of the group, utterly incapable  of achieving such a tremendous task.' Shoghi Effendi, Baha'( News, Nov. 1933. 

 'Shoghi Effendi firmly believes that consultation must be maintained between the


<p562>
562                 THE BAHA WORLD

National Spiritual Assembly

 and the entire body of the believers, and that such consultation,  while the Convention is not in session can best be maintained through the agency of the Local Assemblies, one of whose essential functions  is to act as intermediaries between the local communities and their national representatives. 

 The main purpose of the Nineteen-Day Feast is to enable individual believers to offer any suggestion to the Local Assembly which in its turn will pass it to the National Spiritual Assembly. 

 The Local Assembly is, therefore, the proper medium through which local Baha'i communities can communicate with the body of the national representatives.' Letter on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, 18 Nov. 1933. 

 'Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the principle of the undoubted right of the individual to self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his views 'Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not dictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of the spirit of a true Baha'i can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and shbmission, of the sanctity  of the right of the individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence  on the one hand, and fellowship, candour,  and courage on the other.' B.A., pp. 63 — 64. 
                           
  DECISIONS AND APPEALS      

  At this crucial stage in the history of our Faith it seems advisable to emphasize to each Local Assembly an important principle of administration which has been too frequently overlooked. 

 This principle establishes the National Assembly as the court of appeal from decisions of Local Assemblies when protested by one or more members of the community as unjust or as not conforming to the actual facts. 

 A court of appeal is not responsible for determining the facts but only for reviewing the local decision based upon the facts assembled  by the Local Assembly itself. On receiving an appeal the National Spiritual Assembly will send a copy of it to the Local Assembly and request its opinion. 

 When this is received the case will be studied in the light of the facts presented to the National Assembly and a final decision made. The National Assembly can decide only upon the facts presented to it; therefore, when a matter is submitted to it, all obtainable facts, together with supporting documentary evidence should be included. The National Assembly's decision, whether approving or disapproving the original decision of the Local Assembly, will be communicated to both the Local Assembly and to the person or persons who made the appeal. 

 This procedure is in accordance with both the national and local ByLaws. 

 Any complaint received by the National Assembly from a member or members of a local community who have not first submitted their complaint to the Local Assembly will be returned to those making the protest, with a copy of the letter being sent to the Local Assembly for its information. 

 In such a case the Local Assembly is to call the person or persons in for consultation and act upon the complaint. 

 An essential function of the Local Spiritual Assembly is the maintenance of unity and devotion  among the believers. As 'Trustees of the Merciful' the Spiritual Assembly must be selfless and impartial, considerate of the rights of the individual, but firm and steadfast in upholding the vital truths of the Revelation and obedience to its institutions. 

 Therefore, they must discriminate between situations which are transient and trivial and those which threaten to disrupt the community. 

 A distinction  is to be made between personalities who cause disturbances because they lack grounding in the basic Teachings and attitudes of the Baha'i life, and those who deliberately cause trouble because in their hearts they do not accept the principle of authority as vested in the Manifestation, or in the institutions of the Baha'i world community. 

 The Local Assembly is responsible for dealing with all local problems, but can call upon the 

National Spiritual Assembly
for advice if necessary.   

 The National Assembly, in any case involving two or more local communities, however, acts directly and deals with the problems as the court of original jurisdiction, since no Local Assembly has authority outside its own civil area. 
    'The authority of the      

National Spiritual Assembly

 is undivided and unchallengeable in all matters pertaining to the administration of


<p563>

     THE BAHA'I FUND           

  'As the progress and extension of spiritual activities is dependent and conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that immediately after the establishment of Local as well as National Spiritual Assemblies, a Baha'i Fund be established, to be placed under the exclusive control of the Spiritual Assembly. All donations and contributions should be offered to the treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of promoting the interests of the Cause, throughout that locality or country. 

 It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of Baha'u'llah who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute  freely and generously for the increase of that Fund. 

 The members of the Spiritual Assembly will at their own discretion expend it to promote the Teaching Campaign, to help the needy, to establish educational Baha'i institutions, to extend in every way possible their sphere of service. I cherish the hope that all the friends, realizing the necessity of this measure will bestir themselves and contribute however modestly at first, towards the speedy establishment and the increase of that 

Fund                      
•     ..'B.A.,pp.41 — 42.   

 'We must be like the fountain or spring that is continually emptying itself of all that it has and is continually being refilled from an invis ible source. To be continually giving out for the good of our fellows undeterred by the fear of poverty and reliant on the unfailing bounty of the Source of all wealth and all good — this is the secret of right living.' Shoghi Effendi, Baha'( News, Sept. 1926. 

 'As the activities of the American Baha'i community expand, and its worldwide prestige correspondingly increases, the institution of the National Fund, the bedrock on which all other institutions must necessarily rest and be established, acquires added importance, and should be increasingly supported by the entire body of the believers, both in their individual capacities, and through their collective efforts, whether organized as groups or as Local Assemblies. 

 The supply of funds, in support of the National Treasury, constitutes, at the present  time, the lifeblood of these nascent institutions you are labouring to erect. Its importance cannot, surely, be overestimated. 

 Untold blessings  shall no doubt crown every effort directed to that end.' MA., p. 5. 

 'In connection with the institution of the National Fund.. I feel urged to remind you of the necessity of ever bearing in mind the cardinal  principle that all contributions to the Fund are to be purely and strictly voluntary in character .' B.A., p. 101. 

 'Moreover, we should, I feel, regard it as an axiom and guiding principle of Baha'i administration that in the conduct of every specific Baha'i activity, as different from undertakings of a humanitarian, philanthropic, or charitable character, which may in future be conducted under Baha'i auspices, only those who have already identified themselves with the Faith and are regarded as its avowed and unreserved supporters, should be invited to join and collaborate.' B.A., p. 182. 

 A statement from the National Treasurer is included in an issue of the Baha'( News each year, setting out the various funds — international, national, and local — with instructions for making contributions to each of them.

THE INSTITUTION OF THE
                  MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR

                     1. FOREWORD

  Blessed is he who directeth his steps towards the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at the hour of dawn, communing with Him, attuned to His remembrance, imploring His forgiveness. And having entered therein, let him sit in silence to hearken unto the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Say, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar K in truth any House raised in towns or villages, for mention of Me. Thus hat/i it been named before His Throne; would that ye know it. Baha'u'llah, Kitab-i-Aqdas IMIANY discerning minds have testified to the profoundly significant change which has taken place during recent years in the character of popular religious thinking. Religion has developed an entirely new emphasis, more especially for the layman, quite independent of the older sectarian divisions. 

 Instead of considering that religion is a matter of turning toward an abstract creed, the average religionist today is concerned with the practical applications of religion to the problems  of human life. Religion, in brief, after having apparently lost its influence in terms of theology, has been restored more powerfully than ever as a spirit of brotherhood, an impulse toward unity, and an ideal making for a more enlightened civilization throughout the world. 

 Against this background, the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar stands revealed as the supreme expression of all those modern religious  tendencies animated by social ideals which do not repudiate the reality of spiritual experience  but seek to transform it into a dynamic striving for unity. The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar when clearly understood, gives the world its most potent agency for applying mystical vision  or idealistic aspiration to the service of humanity. It makes visible and concrete those deeper meanings and wider possibilities of religion which could not be realized until the dawn of this universal age. 

 The term 'Matriqu'1-A~lik~r' means literally,  'Dawning-place of the praise of God.' 

 To appreciate the significance of this Baha'i institution, we must lay aside all customary ideas of the churches and cathedrals of the past. 

The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar      

 fulfils the original intention of religion in each dispensation, before that intention had become altered and veiled by human invention and belief. 

    The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar      

 is a channel releasing spiritual powers for social regeneration because it fills a different function than that assumed by the sectarian church. 

 Its essential purpose is to provide a community meeting-place  for all who are seeking to worship God, and achieves this purpose by interposing no manmade veils between the worshipper and the Supreme. Thus, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is freely open to people of all Faiths on equal terms, who now realize the universality of Baha'u'llah in revealing the oneness of all the Prophets. 

 Moreover, since the Baha'i Faith has no professional clergy, the worshipper entering the Temple hears no sermon and takes part in no ritual the emotional effect of which is to establish a separate group consciousness. 

 Integral with the Temple are its accessory buildings, without which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar would not be a complete social institution.  These buildings are to be devoted to such activities as a school for science, a hospice, a hospital, an asylum for orphans. 

 Here the circle of spiritual experience at last joins, as prayer and worship are allied directly to creative service,  eliminating the static subjective elements from religion and laying a foundation for a new and higher type of human association.

        2. THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
                 MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR

            A LETTER FROM SHOGHI EFFENDI

  IT should be borne in mind that the central edifice of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, round which in the fullness of time shall cluster such institutions  of social service as shall afford relief to the suffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the bereaved, and education  to the ignorant, should be regarded apart from these dependencies, as a house solely  designed and entirely dedicated to the worship  of God in accordance with the few yet definitely prescribed principles established by Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. It should not be inferred, however, from this general statement that the interior of the central edifice itself will be converted into a conglomeration of religious services conducted along lines associated with the traditional procedure obtaining in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other temples of worship. Its various avenues of approach, all converging towards the central hail beneath its dome, will not serve as admittance to those sectarian adherents of rigid formulae and manmade creeds, each bent, according to his way, to observe his rites, recite his prayers, perform his ablutions, and display the particular symbols of his faith within separately defined sections of Baha'u'llah's Universal House of Worship. Far from the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar offering such a spectacle of incoherent and confused sectarian observances and rites, a condition wholly incompatible with the provisions of the Aqdas and irreconcilable with the spirit it inculcates, the central House of Baha'i worship, enshrined within the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, will gather within its chastened walls, in a serenely spiritual atmosphere, only those who, discarding forever the trappings of elaborate and ostenatious ceremony, are willing worshippers of the one true God, as manifested in this age in the Person of Baha'u'llah. To them will the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar symbolize the fundamental verity underlying the Baha'i Faith, that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is not final but progressive. Theirs will be the conviction that an all-loving and ever-watchful Father Who, in the past, and at various stages in the evolution of mankind, has sent forth His Prophets as the Bearers of His Message and the Manifestations of His Light to mankind, cannot at this critical period of their civilization withhold from His children the guidance which they sorely need amid the darkness which has beset them, and which neither the light of science nor that of human intellect and wisdom can succeed in dissipating.  And thus having recognized in Baha'u'llah the source whence this celestial light proceeds, they will irresistibly feel attracted to seek the shelter of His house, and congregate therein, unhampered by ceremonials and unfettered by creed, to render homage to the one true God, the Essence and Orb of eternal Truth, and to exalt and magnify the name of His 

Messengers and Prophets   

 Who, from time immemorial even unto our day, have, under divers circumstances and in varying measure, mirrored forth to a dark and wayward world the light of heavenly guidance. 

 But however inspiring the conception of Baha'i worship, as witnessed in the central edifice of this exalted Temple, it cannot be regarded as the sole, nor even the essential, factor in the part which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar,  as designed by Baha'u'llah, is destined  to play in the organic life of the 

Baha'i community. Divorced

 from the social, humanitarian, educational and scientific pursuits  centring around the dependencies of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, Baha'i worship, however exalted in its conception, however passionate in fervor, can never hope to achieve beyond the meagre and often transitory results produced by the contemplations of the ascetic or the communion of the passive worshipper. 

 It cannot  afford lasting satisfaction and benefit to the worshipper himself, much less to humanity in general, unless and until translated and transfused  into that dynamic and disinterested service  to the cause of humanity which it is the supreme privilege of the dependencies of the Mashriqu'1-A~~k6r to facilitate and promote.


<p570>
570            THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH

  Nor will the exertions, no matter how disinterested and strenuous, of those who within the precincts of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will be engaged in administering the affairs of the future Baha'i commonwealth, fructify and prosper unless they are brought into close and daily communion with those spiritual agencies centring in and radiating from the central shrine of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 Nothing short of direct and constant interaction between  the spiritual forces emanating from this House of Worship centring in the heart of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and the energies consciously displayed by those who administer its affairs in their service to humanity can possibly provide the necessary agency capable of removing the ills that have so long and so grievously afflicted humanity. For it is assuredly upon the consciousness of the efficacy of the 

Revelation of Baha'u'llah   

 reinforced  on one hand by spiritual communion with His Spirit, and on the other by the intelligent application and the faithful execution of the principles and laws He revealed, that the salvation of a world in travail must ultimately depend. And of all the institutions that stand associated with His Holy Name, surely none save the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar can most adequately provide the essentials of Baha worship and service, both so vital to the regeneration of the world. Therein lies the secret  of the loftiness, of the potency, of the unique position of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar as one of the outstanding institutions conceived by 

Baha'u'llah.

  The Mother Temple of the West, Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.A. The cornerstone was laid by 'Abdu'l-Baha on 1 May 1912. On 23 May 1978 the structure was designated by the United States government 'one of the nation's cultural resources worthy of preservation' and listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

             3. THE MOTHER TEMPLE OF THE

                INDIAN SUBCONTINENT

                      F. SAHBA

  To raise an edifice and create within it an atmosphere that will reflect the glory and majesty of the Greatest Name is indeed a challenging commission and a daunting task. This awesome responsibility devolves upon an architecture that in the fullness of time will be inspired from the ocean of Baha'i art. At this embryonic stage of our acquaintance with a Dispensation divine in origin, how can we be so presumptuous as to even make mention of 'Baha'i art' when we recognize that the Revelation of Baha'u'llah will eventually draw forth from countless minds and hearts and hands art forms of such splendour as we cannot now even dimly imagine. We in this day have the same feeling as a beginner in primary school who, while struggling to learn the basic alphabet, views the shelves of books in the libraries and has a vague precognition that when he has mastered the alphabet he will discover a great new world. Nevertheless, the restive imagination of the child cannot be prevented from roaming this mysterious world. 

 We may take comfort in the thought that one day in the distant future the true Baha artists of the Golden Age of our Faith may look upon our efforts with understanding and recognize that although we had no share of the boundless ocean from which they may draw their inspiration yet we, with hearts throbbing with longing, were ardently seeking it. I have not visited any of the existing Houses of Worship but one of the fondest memories of my childhood is listening to my mother's description of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 'Ish-q6b4d  with its heavenly atmosphere — the light that filtered through the arched, latticed windows onto the lectern; the echo of the chanting of prayers all mingling together to ascend upwards towards a dome resplendent with engravings; and, in the centre of the dome, a star that reminded one of celestial palaces. 

 Undoubtedly my mother had found beneath that majestic dome the spiritual comfort of which she spoke with so much feeling. This is how I first thought of a House of 

Worship.                   

 There is no doubt that the interest which 'Abdu'l-Baha expressed in the Taj Mahal of India had a significant influence on the designs of several of the Baha Houses of Worship. In designing the House of Worship to beerected in India one could not forget that He had expressed admiration for this splendid historical  monument. 

 There is a symbolism in the Taj Mahal which speaks to the very hearts of the people: with its roots in the earth, it speaks of divinity. It is like a white dove soaring in the blue sky. In sunshine, in rain, at sunrise, at sunset, it manifests varied splendours. Although the architect has created a unique building that is magnificent in itself, undoubtedly it is the story of the monument and its bond with the culture of India that have played a major role in making it immortal in the hearts of the people of that country. 

 Therefore, with the House of Worship of India, beauty and symmetry of architecture would not in themselves be sufficient:  the edifice must speak in a meaningful way to the hearts of the people. Perhaps nowhere else in the world is this matter of greater importance. India is a land of secrets and mysteries. Every shape and form has its own myth and legend and is a symbol of a cherished belief, and such beliefs are an inseparable part of Indian life. The little shrub growing in a corner of a temple court, the paint on the courtyard walls, the engravings visible on its fa~ade — a11 are bound with inseparable ties to the temple. In India, if you were to lead a blind person to a temple he would, from the smell of the plants and by touching the walls, be able to tell you the religion to which that temple belongs. 

 The House of Worship of India could not be an inspiration from or a derivation of any of the existing examples or schools of religious architecture for this would have identified it in the minds of the people with structures held sacred by other religions — Hindu, Buddhist or


<p572>
572                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Muslim. Although the building must come to be recognized as being associated with the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, manifesting and symbolic of the Greatest Name, its design must be familiar to the people of India, creating a bridge to their own heritage, in much the same way as when the principles of the Faith are explained to one with a receptive spirit the Listener feels that the words in all their freshness have a familiar strain, like a remembered dream that is now coming true. Such a concept could not be realized through instruments and capacities available to an architect regardless of the extent of his knowledge  and experience. 

 I am certain that it could only be confirmed through divine assistance. 

 Whenever it is asked how the idea of this design was conceived I realize with ever-increasing awe and wonderment that from the very first step I have been guided. However, it would be untrue to say that this was as a result of study and research or consultation with the learned and the accomplished. With excitement and anxiety and many questions in my heart I beseeched the prayers of the Universal House of Justice and set about travelling throughout India. I was attracted to people of diverse backgrounds and classes and am convinced that it was through the bounties of Baha'u'llah that these people were prompted to direct me. 

 At the outset, in a small city of India, a simple and goodhearted teacher spoke spontaneously to me about the lotus. On that day his purity and friendliness, more than his ideas, attracted my heart, but from then on the image of the lotus seemed to grow in my awareness more and more persistently, however much I tried to resist this notion with its attendant danger of producing a design that would be merely a poor imitation of nature. 

 Wherever I went, whether to ancient Hindu temples or Buddhist caves, among all the carvings and symbols the lotus flower seemed to stand out and to capture my eye until, for the first time without reservation, I shared my idea with a friend who had wide experience and knowledge of the cultures and religions of India and who had come to guide me round the temples of a city in southern India. He listened to me with shining eyes and growing excitement and together we were prompted to find a growing lotus plant. All day we searched, undeterred by the realization that it was not the season, and at last we found a single blossom in a small pond. On that day I resolved to justify the lotus as a concept for the House of Worship. 

 From then on, with each passing day, I became more strongly convinced that this was the only solution. 

 The lotus flower is rooted in slime and yet it speaks of a world of purity because it floats on the water's surface in the utmost purity and grace and remains untainted in the midst of filth. 

 The loveliness and immaculacy of this flower, which sparkles everywhere like a star on the waters of India, have made it a symbol of spirituality and beauty in the mythology of all the religions of that country. In Hindu mythology Brahma, the Creator, is described as having sprung from the lotus that grew out of Vishnu's navel when that deity lay absorbed in meditation; hence one of the epithets of Brahma is lotus-born. 

 In Buddhist and Jam temples all over Asia you will find idols of Buddha and of others always seated~ on the lotus flower. The lotus has been accorded the greatest importance in the decoration  of temples of all religions throughout India and perhaps all countries in East Asia. The most sacred prayer of the Buddhists of Tibet extols a sanctified jewel in the lotus flower: '0 Jewel in the Lotus.' 

 I learned that for centuries the people of India had conceived  the lotus as a temple of light, a dream-thought  which could now be realized. The glad-tidings of the 'Jewel in the Lotus' had been given to them and this Jewel could be none other than the Greatest Name. 

 When we made from cr&pe paper the first model of the design for the House of Worship of the Indian subcontinent I observed it keenly with awe and a dawning realization that the essential element of that design had not come from me. With gratitude and humility I then became assured that BahA'u' -11Th  had indeed answered my prayers.

574           THE BAHA'I WORLD

  4. THE LOTUS OF BAHAPUR

            SHERIAR NOOREYEZDAN

  THE designing of a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is a spiritual undertaking, an effort to clothe religious truth in material garb, an endeavour to symbolize divinity, an attempt to harmonize  the aspirations of peoples, an enterprise to establish upon the face of the earth a magnet to attract the bounties of God. It is an adventure in creativity that calls for more than the best architectural skills. 

 The renowned  architect of the Wilmette Temple, Louis Bourgeois, commenting upon his design for the Mother Temple of the West, has succinctly recorded: 'Its inception was not from man, for, as musicians, artists, poets, receive their inspiration from another realm, so the Temple's architect, through all his years of labour, was ever conscious that Baha'u'llah was the creator of this building to be erected to His glory.' 

 ft is therefore with awe and reverence  that an architect approaches the designing  of a House of Worship, an edifice designated  by the Supreme Pen as the 'Dawning-place of the praise of God'. 

 For general guidance the architect first immerses himself in the infalliffle 

Writings of Baha'u'llah     

 and 'Abdu'l-Baha  and seeks guidance in the writings of Shoghi Effendi. 

 Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas calls upon His followers to erect in every city Houses of Worship in His Name, as perfect as can be built on earth, wherein praise of the Lord may resound in a spirit of joy and radiance, hearts be illumined and eyes solaced. Among the encouragements and instructions that flowed from the pen of 'Abdu'l-Baha to the early American believers engaged in raising the Mother Temple in Wilmette is this brief description of the 'Ishqabad Temple: It has nine avenues, nine gardens, nine fountains, so it is nine on nine, all nines. It is like a beautiful bouquet. Just imagine an edifice of that beauty in the centre, very lofty, surrounded by gardens, variegatedflowers. 

 That is the way it should be matchless most beautiful. 

 And from the stream of directives of the beloved Guardian to National Spiritual Assemblies and individuals involved in the raising of different Houses of Worship the architect gleans that great emphasis is Laid upon the elegance and dignity of the building. 

 These being the general overall instructions with regard to the design, the architect must in addition take into account the religious and cultural background of the people of the land, accommodating their susceptibilities and aspirations.  Ideally, the design must be distinctive yet unrelated to any established school of architecture and dissimilar to traditional places of communal worship so as to attract all and exdude none. The architect is therefore called upon to weave into his design the basic tenets and symbolize the fundamental aim of the 

Cause of God.              

 Mr. Farfburz Sahb6, architect of the Mother Temple of India, had never conceived or attempted a total design for a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, although he had had some notions and innovative ideas on separate elements of a building with such spiritual significance. 
It was the Hand of the     

Cause Dr. Rahmatu'llhh Muhajir

 who first suggested to Mr. SaliM, who was then working as an associate architect  on the design of the permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice, that he prepare a design for the Indian Temple. Mr. SahbA admits, 'This suggestion and the thought of such an undertaking kept me awake many nights.' For the first time he began to give serious thought to this subject and he put on paper the images and ideas he had conceived for some separate elements of a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 Realizing the importance of a greater understanding and deeper ap-preckition of the multifaceted culture of India, Mr. Sahb6 embarked upon a 'voyage of discovery' to India whose rich and varied culture awed, illumined and inspired him. He travelled the length and breadth of the subcontinent  with an open mind, later stating: 'This journey provided me with a fresh insight into the boundless horizons of Indian culture and heightened my esteem and respect for India. 

 I also realized the difficulty of the task of producing a design, a concept, a symbol that would transcend every barrier of region, religion, language, caste and culture and


<p575>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH    575

  which would be capable of attracting the hearts of the varied and pure-hearted people of India.' 

 Elsewhere in this volume Mr. SahM has related how he came to select as the design concept of the Temple the Lotus, significant in Indian mythology and associated with worship in that country from time immemorial. 

 It became his task to work this concept into a design that would reveal the simplicity, clarity, freshness and unifying power of the Baha Revelation and be a constant reminder that all Revelation springs from one divine source. 

 He was concerned that the building should inspire reverence and be spiritually uplifting. 

 With his thoughts crystallized, Mr. Sahbd returned to the drawing-board. Step by step the building took shape on paper. He wanted the Temple to resemble the lotus bloom in its natural habitat as closely as possible. Into such a design there had to be worked, naturally, the directives of 'Abdu'l-Baha on the general design of a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. Nine leaves were created which serve as entrances and give the appearance of the completely opened petals of the Lotus. 

 Nine inner leaves constitute the dome, the leaves converging at the apex and giving the appearance  of petals just opening. And in order that the building resemble a natural lotus a third medial set of nine outer leaves was provided, these giving the appearance of semi-opened petals. 

 Internally, thirty-six unopened petals, or the lotus bud, took the form of nine thin hemispherical shells of concrete crisscrossing each other and constituting the interior dome. A Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is to have nine pools and fountains, according to the wish of 'Abdu'l-Baha, so nine pools were provided. 

 Administrative offices, conference and audiovisual rooms, residential accommodation for the caretaker and other facilities were provided  in the two wings of an ancillary building landscaped into the design by exploiting the natural contours of the site. All this gave symmetry and shape to the building but many other factors needed to be considered such as electrification, plumbing and water drainage and a suitable system of airconditioning that would make the temperature inside the auditorium equable and comfortable in the extreme temperatures of Delhi. 

 For the internal illumination of the Temple Mr. Sah&i concealed all electrical lighting within the interior dome, or the folds of unopened Lotus petals, so that when the lights were turned on a soft translucent light would fill the auditorium giving the impression of natural light filtering from outside through the folds of the Lotus bud. This would also symbolize divine bounties and spiritual illumination  flowing through the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to worshippers within. 

 External illumination of the building was designed to highlight only the superstructure against the dark skyline so as to give the impression that the Temple was not anchored to the earth like ordinary buildings, but appeared as a bright lotus bloom suspended between heaven and earth. The architect had always thought of using light and water to underline the characteristics  of the Temple and he has effectively done so in his design. With a stroke of genius he has created an eminently practical and economical system of airconditioning the large central auditorium using the pools and fountains already provided. The natural slope of the land is made use of in the creation. of a large basement at the level of the pools. 

 The floor of the auditorium is lowered by three feet so that five steps lead down from the outer podium and the spaces between the steps act like louvres that allow the air, cooled naturally by passing over the pools and through the fountain sprays, into the auditorium at floor level. The warm air rises up to the dome and escapes at the top so that a convection current is set up and the structure acts as a chimney. This process is supplemented by impellers and expellers fixed in the basement and interior dome respectively. 

 The entire system can be reversed during winter so that the temperature within the auditorium is always equable. 

 Now the architect's inspired dream had to be objectified in a building of structural reliability to serve as a monument that would stand for several centuries. This important responsibility was given to Flint and Neill of London, the renowned firm of structural engineers who worked on the Panama Temple. For over a year Mr. Sahb6 and Dr. Flint, with the assistance of specialist engineers and the use of computers, collaborated in working out all the details of the building's structure. 
A


<p576>
576                 THE BAHA I WORLD

  great deal of research and study had to be undertaken in London and Delhi and voluminous data, not easily assembled, were collected. As no geological survey reports were available test bores were made in order to study the rock stratification of the area. Meteordogical statistics of the past one hundred  years were researched to note the highest  and lowest temperatures recorded, the strongest winds, the severest earthquakes, the wettest monsoon and extremes of humidity. All these details, so critical in the designing of a monumental building, were painstakingly gathered and catered for in the final architectural  and structural designs. All structuTal drawings and calculations were double-checked in Geneva through the good offices of Prof. 

 Hushmand Naimi, lecturer and consultant  in structural engineering. 

 Nor did the checking end there. Although the behaviour of reinforced concrete and that of its ingredients are well known, yet the determination of the type of concrete and its strength for each part of the structure became a study in itself and called for conferences with specialist concrete technologists and the specialists of the Concrete Association of England. Moreover, a scale model of the Temple was made by specialists in London and subjected to various tests not usually applied to building designs. Wind tunnel tests proved that the building could withstand the strongest wind forces and rotary movement of the high superstructure was well provided for. To study the efficiency of the natural airconditioning system coloured smoke was injected from various points into the transparent plexiglass model, and the movement as well as rate of evacuation of the smoke bore out the viability of the design. 

 While no efforts could be spared to create a building 'upon which depended the prestige of the Cause' and to design a structure that would conform to the general configuration prescribed by 'Abdu'l-Baha, that would be both symbolic and of aesthetic beauty and that would be of such structural integrity as to last several centuries, the designers laboured under a serious constraint. 

 They did not have the freedom to employ the best materials and technology available in the world but were limited to the use of materials, skills and equipment available in India. At every stage the availability and quality of essential materials had to be verified and references continually made to the Code of Indian Standards  for construction materials: the available diameters and grades of steel; the types and strengths of cement manufactured; availability  of copper pipes for superstructure water drainage; of lead sheets for flashings; of galvanized reinforcement bars; of glass sheets of the required thickness for glazing; of cladding materials such as marble or special ceramic tiles for the petals, and hundreds of other items which are easily obtained in western countries. 

 This major constraint notwithstanding,  the design that finally emerged bears eloquent testimony to the inspiration and bounty that were bestowed upon the designers.  Their dedicated efforts were crowned with the completion of a design that has already attracted the attention of the architectural and civil engineering worlds and has come to be considered among professionals as one of the outstanding designs of the century. The model of the House of Worship has been accorded a place of distinction in the construction  department of the Science Museum of London and after completion of construction the model will be sent there. 

 Mr. Sahbd's three-year long odyssey of study and prayerful search was over at last and his chosen design was captured in some four hundred blueprints ready to be translated into an exquisite building. 

 The final design and layout were presented to the 

Universal House of Justice 

 in 1977. It was proposed that within the rectangular plot of land measuring about 450 metres in length in an east — west direction and 220 metres in width the Temple building would be located at the western end with its main eDtrance facing east. Entry to the Temple ground would be from the main road leading to a parking area at the east end of the estate. 

 A 250-metre walkway would lead to the ancillary building between the two wings of which would rise the main entrance steps to the Temple. At a point some 50 metres from the ancillary building two corresponding paths would diverge to the south and north for access to other entrances of the Temple. The ancillary building, completely landscaped and almost concealed, would provide about 900 square metres of space for administrative and other services. The steps between the wings of


<p577>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH   577

  the ancillary building would lead to a bridge over the pools and onto the outer podium or walkway around the main building. 

 Facing each of the nine bridges would be a doorway into the auditorium canopied by its entrance petal 7.5 metres high. Standing between the entrance petal and inner petals would be the outer petals, 22.5 

 metres in height, surrounding the external dome made up of the nine inner petals. 

 The diameter of the dome would be 35 metres and its height 28 metres from the floor of the auditorium and 43 metres from the main entrance steps. All the petals that, with the interior dome, comprise the superstructure would be thin double curvatured toroidal shells of white concrete finish internally and clad externally with white marble. The doorways  would lead into the auditorium down five steps under nine massive arches. The auditorium would be circular with a diameter of 36 metres and have a seating capacity of about 1,200, which could be increased by an additional 1,000 seats in the triangular balconies formed between the entrance and outer petals. The balcony and auditorium floors, as well as the steps and arches, would be covered with white marble, and the walkway around the central auditorium with red sandstone. The outer podium over the pools up to the bridges would be edged with specially designed  and precast banisters in white concrete. There would be a walkway around the tops of all nine pools while steps would take visitor and worshipper to the lower walkway at basement level around four of the pools. These walkways and steps would also be covered with red sandstone. Thus a part of the outer basement area would be open to visitors and the remainder would be enclosed and used for various installations and equipment. The distance across the pools would be about 120 metres while the area of each pooi would be 500 square metres. 

 Fountains would jet water outwards across the one-metre deep pools. Water in the pools would be replaced periodically but would be continuously filtered  and kept clean by filtration plants ensconced beneath the bridge abutments. 

 The surrounding grounds would be suitably landscaped and beautified with decorative trees and flowering plants. 

 The concept and design met with the general approval of the Universal House of Justice which, on 3 August 1977, confirmed Mr. Sahixi's appointment, stating: 'We are profoundly impressed by the beauty of the concept you have presented.' 

When Abdu'l-Baha  Rii~ffyyih

 Khdnum was invited to view the model she summed up the appreciation of all. 

 In her own words: 'When I was invited by the Universal House of Justice to see this design, I was apprehensive. 

 Being an architect's daughter I know what a difficult problem  it is to design a circular nine-sided building. But when I saw this beautiful model I was deeply impressed and I think that it will be a wonderful thing and very much loyed in India.' 

 On the symbolism of the lotus, Riihiy-yih  Kh6num added: 'The lotus has not only an association with Buddhism and Hinduism, but, par excellence, it is the symbol of the Manifestation of God. The Lotus is probably the most perfect flower in the whole world. 

 It is symmetrical, it is exquisitely beautiful. 
And how does it grow?      

 It grows in a swamp and it raises its head out of the slime absolutely clean and perfect. Now this is what the Manifestation of God is in the world: perfect. lie comes out of the slime. Lie comes from the worst place in the planet. He appears amongst the worst people in the planet, so that nobody can say that we made Him. They say oniy God brings forth such a being from such an environment. 

 This is perhaps the greatest symbolism of the Lotus.' 
                           
Fund Raising               

 Those beacons of divine illumination, the majestic Houses of Worship standing in different  continents of the globe beckoning the foundering ship of human society to the safe haven of the Cause of God, have been raised through the sacrificial outpourings of the worldwide community of the Greatest Name and are manifestations of the zeal and dedication of the followers of Baha'u'llah. 

 The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is a divinely-ordained institution of the Cause of God and endowed with power and potency so great that the beloved Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha, has affirmed that its mystery cannot be understood. 

 We have His assurance that Some material things have spiritual effect, and the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, though outwardly a material foundation, is possessed of spiritual effect and causes the union of hearts and the gathering of souls. In


<p578>

  their eagerness, therefore, to fulfil one of the injunctions of the Supreme Pen and to raise in the world institutions that can alter constructively the course of history and the spiritual destiny of nations and peoples, Ba-h~'is  everywhere rise spontaneously and make every sacrifice necessary, delighting to avail~ themselves of the priceless opportunity to share in such a glorious spiritual enterprise. The beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, has emphasized'. 

 the greater the sacrifice, the greater the power of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar'. 

 During the Ten Year Crusade, after approval  of Shoghi Effendi was received for the land, the National Spiritual Assembly entered into negotiations with the owners of the five separate plots that were comprised in the total area of about 92,000 square metres (22.5 acres) and settled for a price of Rs. 140,289. This was a considerable sum of money for the number of believers at the time, and the National Spiritual Assembly set about raising the sum. The amount was distributed among the communities of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, then under one jurisdiction, and members of the National Assembly set out in different directions to acquaint the believers with the need and to encourage them to raise this unprecedentedly large sum. The extraordinary response of a modest and devout believer, Mr. Ardashir Rustampiir of Hyderabad,  Sind, is alluded to in the 'In Mem-oriam' article appearing elsewhere in this volume of the international record. 

 As if he had waited a lifetime for this opportunity, he placed before the astonished members of the National Assembly, Mr. Isfandiar 

Bakhtiari and Mr. Abbas   

 Aly Bhatt, his entire savings of Rs. 100,190 accumulated from the operation  of his restaurant, remarking: 'It is not my mOney; all of it belongs to Baha'u'llah and I am happy to return it. I have been merely a trustee, a temporary keeper.' 

 When discreet enquiries by the representatives of the National Spiritual Assembly revealed  that indeed Mr. Rustampdr had no other savings and had kept nothing whatever for any contingencies they expressed to him their concern, urging him to keep some amount for himself, and received his ready reply: 'What I have given to the Cause I cannot take back. If I deserve it, then Baha'u'llah will surely meet my future needs.' 

 Only at the insistence of the National Assembly representatives, and as a token of obedience, did Mr. Rustamptir relent and agree to accept Rs. 190. His magnanimous contribution  covered the total cost of the first and largest of five plots. Now, as long as the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar stands at Bahapur, will generations of Baha'is recall the generosity and be inspired by the devotion of this humble believer. 

 Fund-raising for the construction of the Temple began in a very strange way and in a most unexpected place. 

 A Baha'i serving a prison sentence in Mozambique had made some simple rings out of ivory and had sent one to Abdu'l-Baha R6hiyyih Kh~num when she was in Africa. At the time of the dedication of the Panama Temple in 1972 when R6hfyyih Kfrmnum addressed the friends she expressed her thought that 'it wouki be lovely if we sent a little nest-egg from the dedication of this Temple for the next Baha'i Temple that will be built' and she offered the ivory ring for sale. 

 Present at that gathering was a young Baha'i from Hawaii who was a jeweller. Though not a wealthy man he had, in the course of his business, come into possession of a very large emerald. Impetuously, and though he could ill-afford it, he offered the valuable emerald, worth at least $25,000 to $30,000, for the inexpensive ivory ring. Later the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of Panama went to Hawaii especially to take charge of the emerald which had, in the meantime, been set in a large gold setting and she delivered it to R6hiyyih KhAnum during the International Convention in 

Haifa in 1973. Abdu'l-Baha

 Rahiyyib KlPnum entrusted the beautiful gem to the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of fran, also present at the Convention, instructing them to auction it, accept the highest bid and contribute the proceeds as the first contribution to the cast of constructing the future Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to be erected during the next teaching Plan. The emerald fetched the handsome sum of approximately $100,000. 

 Mysterious indeed are the ways of God! The simple ivory ring made in an African prison and worth perhaps one dollar, but offered with complete sincerity and love, became the largest single contribution and the nest-egg from the Panama Temple to the


<p579>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH    579

  Indian Temple. Nor was this the end of it, for when Rhhiyyih KMnum narrated this touching  story at the time the foundation stone of the Indian Temple was laid at Bahapur on 17 October 1977 the participants in that historic gathering were so moved that many divested themselves of their gold jewellery for the Temple fund, made cash offers on the spot and pledged contributions. 

 Thus the simple restaurateur of Hyderabad, the prisoner of Mozambique and the Hawaiian jeweller became the foremost benefactors of the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent and their example would be emulated by a host of equally dedicated believers throughout the Baha'i world. 

 This befitting beginning of fund-raising was followed by a more sustained and continuous  process. Interestingly, after the Indian Temple fund was announced internationally, among the first contributions to be received from abroad was from the Baha'i children's Moral Class of Samoa where another House of Worship was concurrently under construction.  As reports of. progress of construction were disseminated throughout the Baha'i world community the slow trickle of contributions swelled to a steady flow from both east and west. 

 All at once it appeared as though the Baha'i world had taken the lotus Temple to its heart. Each envelope received at the Temple office brought a token of love and devotion to the Cause. The heartwarming messages that accompanied the contributions were so touching as to bring tears to the eyes. Those servants of Baha'u'llah from the far-flung  corners of the world ceased to be faceless believers but were seen as partners with us in a great spiritual enterprise. The participation of the Baha'is in achieving a common spiritual goal formed a bond that linked continents and countries with Bahapur. Repeated and regular contributions were received  from many individuals and communities, strengthening the bond. 

 Was this part of the mystery of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar spoken of by 'Abdu'l-Baha Indeed, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, when completed, would symbolize the unity and strength of the Baha'i community,  would manifest the potency and divinity of the Supreme Pen and would disseminate  the divine fragrances — as assured by the Universal House of Justice — not only among the multitudes in the Indian subcontinent but throughout Asia. 

 Whereas the believers in all lands, territories and islands of the globe have contributed their mite to the Temple fund, it is significant that the beleaguered and oppressed community of the Greatest Name in fran have been at this time deprived of this privilege and bounty. However,  the very news of the progress of construction  of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar must assuredly  bring to their hearts a measure of cheer. 

 Within India itself the believers have responded with great generosity and self-sacrifice.  One anonymous village Baha'i, for example, dropped into the Temple fund box at an area teaching conference all the money he had, a two-paise coin (one-fifth of a cent) for which another believer offered Rs. 100). Their efforts to date have resulted in the community being able to meet twenty-three per cent of the construction cost incurred thus far. 
                           
Construction               

 One of the goals of the Ten Year Crusade was the acquisition of sites for Houses of Worship in three Asian capitals, including New Delhi. The National Spiritual Assembly of 

India, Pakistan and Burma  

 (as it was known from 1947 to 1957) set about locating a suitable site, their choice falling upon a large tract of hilly land in a totally undeveloped area of south Delhi. The site, which, as has been stated, comprised five plots collectively and measured about 92,000 square metres, was approved by the beloved Guardian. When the land revenue officials visited the site to demarcate the boundaries, their records revealed that the land was part of an ancient village named Bahapur, the 'Abode of Baha'. Baha'is see in this the mysterious hand of Providence. This hillock, they feel, was destined to become the footstool of God and the location of the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent. 

 The area was marked off by a low brick wall and a plaque was mounted designating the property as the site of aBahd'i Temple. This accomplished, the Baha'i community  looked forward to the next development which took place in August 1977 when the Universal House of Justice approved the Temple design and appointed Mr. Sahb4 as architect. 

On 17 October 1977 Abdu'l-Baha


<p580>
580                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  R6hiyyih KhAnum laid the foundation stone of the Temple amid prayers and recitations of praise and gratitude to Baha'u'llah. 

 An excavation contractor was appointed and work got under way at a steady pace. The site being on the brow of a bill its topsoil had been eroded and the foundation pits had to be carved out of granitic rock, weathered and soft in some places but mostly hard and difficult to excavate. During a period of almost twelve months a huge bowl approximately 150 metres in diameter was cut out of the hillside and, within the bowl, seven sets of nine foundation pits in concentric circles for the sixty-three columns and abutments that support the building. Meanwhile the contract and tender documents were drafted in England and in September 1979 tenders were invited. Six of the largest and most experienced companies in India made bids for the contract which, after exhaustive study and comparison, was awarded to Engineering Construction Corporation Ltd. on the first day of Ridvan 1980. Mobilization of the site took about two months, during which period the contractor brought engineers, surveyors, men and equipment  to the area and the next month saw the growth of a little township at Bahapur including site offices, storage facilities, accommodation  for labourers, etc. When trimming and preparation of the pits began it was discovered that in many of the pits soft and dangerous micaceous strata existed. 

 This called for further excavation until hard base-rock was reached in all pits, some at depths of thirty feet. The pits from which would rise the load-bearing columns of the main building were enlarged and deepened to ensure the consistency of hard-rock  strata. 

 A total quantity of about 6,000 cubic metres of rock was excavated, enough to build a stone wall five feet high and one foot thick extending over twelve kilometres. The excavation was completed without any mechanical  equipment and all excavated rock and earth was carried in head-loads. 

 30 July 1980 marked the day of the structural 'birth' of the House of Worship. While the sun played hide-and-seek among the dark monsoon clouds Mrs. Golnar SahM poured the first trowelful of concrete into the first pit of the innermost circle of columns. Prayers were offered and, following tradition, coco nuts were broken and sweets were distributed to the gathering which included representatives  of the Continental Board of 

Counsellors, the National  

 Spiritual Assembly, the Delhi Baha'i community and visiting Baha'is.

 Then came the pouring of concrete to the required levels into the readied pits from which the column footings would rise. 

 Soon the site was alive with the staccato sound of pneumatic drills, chugging and puffing of diesel-driven concrete mixers, whining of concrete vibrators, shouts of supervising foremen  and the singsong of women carrying head-loads of concrete from the mixers. By December 1980 all the yawning foundation pits were filled and the columns began to rise, while the general areas between the columns making up the basement of the main building and floor of the ancillary building were levelled. Now the outlines of the building were discernible. 

 By January 1981 when the Hand of the Cause Paul Haney visited the site, many columns  stood, like silent sentinels, and others were in various stages of construction. 

 The site took on a colourful look as work progressed. 

 The required concrete was churned out, under the watchful eyes of supervisors, by four mixers working in tandem at two convenient locations. 

 Male workers mixed the concrete and filled pressed-steel vessels which their womenfolk carried on their heads, walking  back and forth between mixers and site like an endless human conveyor belt.1 The women, clad in their traditional saris of many 1 Approximately ninety families were among the 500 workers at the site. 

 They were provided with living facilities, and a nursery and primary school were set up at the site to care for and educate the infants and children while their parents were working.

  hues and marching sedately in tune to their own singing, worked cheerfully in two groups, vying with each other. Thus all the columns of the main building were raised, as were also those of the ancillary building and its reinforced  concrete walls. 

 9 May 1981 marked the commencement, amid prayers and the distribution of sweets, of concreting of the podium which was completed  by 16 September. 

 Day and night the sit& during this period presented a picture of feverish activity with each team of skilled workers discharging its allotted responsibility and moving on to the next podium section while another team took over in rapid succession  to carry out its part of the operation. In addition to the normal supervision and precautions usual in the Indian construction industry consideration had to be paid to the extremely high temperatures in Delhi. When feasible, concreting was programmed to take place during the cooler summer nights under floodlights, and when concrete temperatures rose above the stipulated maximum, tons of ice had to be added to the concrete mix to lower the temperature. 

 During the podium concreting, a new element — the contractor's giant tower crane — was introduced. 

 One of the two concrete batching plants was assigned to the crane and the second remained the preserve of the labourers. Whereas earlier two labour crews had vied with each other in concreting footings and columns, now humans pitted themselves in high spirits against a machine. While the crane scooped up hopper-loads  of concrete, swinging into position and emptying 1,000 kilograms of concrete with a giant hiss, the women who made up the human conveyor belt rushed from mixer to site and back with 25-kilogram head-loads of concrete — and they invariably won. It was estimated that during the nineteen weeks devoted to the concreting of the podium each woman worker carried some 7,500 kilograms of concrete in 25-kilogram head-loads over 21 kilometres in an eight-hour working day! The quantity of material making up the podium with its columns — 40,OOO bags of cement, 3,600 cubic metres of aggregate (making 4,000 cubic metres of concrete) and 450 metric tons of reinforcement bars — would have been sufficient to have raised a solid concrete block 25 feet square and 225 feet high, the height Y tC'  — a 14< t ~Q a Construction worker at Temple site; 1983. 
of a twenty-storey building.

 While podium concreting progressed, the rise of the ancillary building kept pace and rose to join the main building over the main entrance bridge that connects the two structures. 

 Construction of the substructure and podium,  being of the normal column-beam-slab type, presented no special technical problems. However, construction of the superstructure with its thin double-curvatured shell elements was something that had never before been attempted in India and necessitated almost eighteen months' study, discussion, resort to computer facilities and the making of full-scale mockups. Designing of the temporary steel staging and support system for the superstructure construction alone, involving the planning, fabrication and erection of some 1,200 metric tons of structural steel, presented


<p582>

  more technical challenges than the contractor had ever faced before. Time and perseverance resolved all problems and overcame all challenges. 

 The exquisite beauty of the lotus design is in the perfect symmetry and sheer lines of the 'petals'. 

 Hence, in the construction of the supeTstructure adherence to the exact geometry  of the design was most critical and the error tolerance virtually nil. Checking systems that were virtually foolproof had to be devised.  The degree of accuracy required had to be achieved, especially in the formwork, with age-old traditional implements. 

 Any oversight or error would be magnified a hundredfold and completely destroy the symmetry and beauty of the building. 

 The first elements of the superstructure to be constructed had to be the nine massive arches, 8 metres high and 10 metres wide, that give entry into the central auditorium of the House of Worship. That happy day.when all the checklist and pour cards were signed off for the first arch concreting was 26 March 1982. 

 Once again the concrete mixers came to life churning out a very rich mix of concrete. When day temperatures were too high during the months of May and June concreting of the arches was carried out under floodlights at night, and under waterproof tarpaulins when monsoon clouds threatened. There was something  special about the second arch to be constructed. This was the arch that faced the Qiblili of the Baha'! 

 wodd, and in its crown, which from the centre of the auditorium exactly faces 'Akka, were embedded on 3 April 1982, the foundation stone and a brick from the SfyTh-ChM as directed by the Universal  House of Justice. The ninth arch was completed on 26 July 1982. The total quantity of materials that went into the arches was sufficient to build a reinforced concrete bridge half a kilometre long and twenty feet wide. Upon completion of this phase of construction another inspiring message was received from the House of Justice: NEWS COMPLETION

 The unique characteristic of the superstructure is that it contains no element with even a single straight line. 

 Such structures cannot be described in the ordinary plan-and-section drawings. 

 Extraordinary measures had to be adopted including the building of full-scale sections of different superstructure elements in timber for use as templates. The most practical method of ensuring accuracy of geometry was found to be to check the curvatures in both directions of every formwork  panel with the special templates, then completely assemble, at ground level, all the panels constituting the complete formwork or mould of each element, rechecking the overall geometry with other templates, number  and dismantle the panels and reassemble them in their respective positions in the structure. Indeed, construction of the superstructure is so difficult that a wellknown British architect, having glanced over the drawings, opined: 'To construct such a building  in Europe will be difficult; in India, impossible.' The complexity of the structure was also underscored by a senior Italian engineer of the firm supplying marble for the external shell cladding who remarked, after studying the drawings and the mockups: 'I cannot sleep at nights for thinking how to cover these leaves with marble.' One wonders, therefore, how those persons can sleep who are charged with the responsibility of supervision and construction of such a complex structure. 

 Another unique feature of the superstructure construction is that it is in white concrete, and galvanized reinforcement bats are used, both for the first time in India. 

 Special efforts were made to locate sources for the best quality white aggregate and white sand to be used with white cement for the superstructure concreting operation. 

 With the gigantic staging erected upon the auditorium floor to support the formwork of the inner leaves, the checked and numbered panels were raised to their respective positions and fastened in place. Panel by panel each inner leaf took shape reaching 30 metres into the sky and was subjected to a final geometry checkout with sensitive instruments. 

 The next phase of work will be the tying of reinforcement bars before the back shutters are erected and the 'sandwich' is completed. Then each leaf will be concreted, nonstop over twenty-four hours to completion, using

 additional adjoining lots have been acquired to permit direct access to the Temple from the main road. 

      At Ridvan 1978 Mr. Liusayn

 Amdnat was appointed architect and in September of that year his design for the Temple was approved by the Universal House of Justice. Following soil testing and engineering studies, tenders for the construction of the House of Worship were let in June 1980. Soil investigation had revealed the need for the injection of considerable  quantities of grouting in lava cavities under the foundation pads, a process occupying  the better part of four months. 

 A contract was signed with a New Zealand contractor and a building permit was issued in August. Tn September work started on the site and on 18 December 1980, in the presence of the Malietoa, the first concrete was poured for the foundations. 

 Construction is now progressing to the architect's satisfaction, and if ideal circumstances obtain, the building is scheduled  for completion by Ridvan 1984. 

 As is true of all Baha Houses of Worship the Samoan Temple will be a nine-sided building, b6autiful in design and workmanship.  This structure will be surmounted by a dome. Landscaped entrances ornamented with trees and fragrant blossoms will rejoice the eyes of the worshipper as he approaches the building to engage in communion with the Creator of his soul. 

 In creating a design for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Pacific islands, the first to rise there; Mr. Am6.nat said that he was much influenced by two factors, the simplicity of life of the Samoan people and the extremely lush, verdant quality of the landscape. Samoa is one of the most beautiful islands of the Pacific. The variegated tropical scenery, so filled with bright colour and busy pattern, suggested to Mr. AmAnat the need for a building of great simplicity that would be sympathetic to its setting, with white predominating against the natural background of blue sky and green verdure. 

 The local residential units indigenous to the island, called fales, are built on a round or


<p586>
586                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  elliptical plan, with ornamented timber posts serving as columns, supporting a thatched roof that has a delicately curved pitch. 

 The most distinctive aspect of a fale is its openness to light and air. Beautiful timber beams support the roof, the beams often handsomely carved and lashed with hemp rope. 

 Lovely, intricate patterns are created by the lashing. Between the posts woven screens are suspended  which may be lowered or raised, permitting maximum flow of air and providing privacy and shelter when needed. 

 The fale is the most significant manmade form found on the island, and its contour or silhouette is seen everywhere. 

 Mr. Am6nat has created for the House of Worship a design that reflects the harmonious relationship of the fale to its setting. 

 His design utilizes nine portals, reminiscent of the posts supporting the roof of the fale, and creating the same openness in the Temple. The dominant white dome is supported by buttress walls which, like the parapet, are of a rough granite of coral hue. 

 The aesthetic balance the architect desired to maintain was achieved through the arrangement of the structural elements and particularly the ribs of the dome. From the exterior the dome is seen to be made out of nine separate sections which are unified into one visual effect through the ribs. The core of each rib will be inset with a special glazing to reduce the effects of tropical heat and to admit light, so that gazing up to the dome from inside the eye will behold a pattern of a nine-pointed star. To avoid maintenance  problems the interior of the dome will be of white concrete, thus eliminating the use of paint and plaster and reinforcing the theme of simplicity which governed the architect in creating his design. The exterior of the dome will be covered with white mosaic tile. 

The                        

 building will be approximately thirty metres high; the height from the floor to the top of the dome will be approximately twenty-seven metres. 

 Materials for the construction of the Temple  have been brought from various parts of the Pacific: white aggregate was imported from Niue Island, white sand from New Zealand, granite from Australia, and cement and steel from New Zealand and Japan. 

 At mezzanine level wooden carvings and tappa designs adapted from the traditional bark cloth patterns used throughout the Pacific  provide simple but effective ornamentation that embellishes but does not over-whehn  the entrance portals. Words of Baha'u'llah  will be carved above the portals. 

 The building combines in its component elements the effect of warmth and nobility to which Mr. Am6nat was so attracted in the Samoan people, and the grandeur that befits a Baha'i House of Worship, yet the scale and proportion are in harmony with the setting. 

 The visitor to the Temple is admitted through a low approach. The overhanging mezzanine successfully protects him from feeling dwarfed or intimidated by the height of the dome. The entire effect is one of being gently enfolded in an atmosphere which invites  worship without distractions caused by ornate elements in the interior design. Raising his glance to trace the ribs of light that rise softly all about him the visitor's eyes will rest upon the symbol of the Greatest Name in the centre of the dome — the Name of Baha'u'llah truly raised aloft in the midmost heart of the ocean.

THE NONPOLITICAL CHARACTER

                OF THE BAHA'I FAITH

    EXCERPTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI

  THE Baha'i principles clearly define and explain the nonpolitical character of the Faith, and serve as a guide for conduct in the relations of Baha'is with one another, with their fellow men, and in their relations with different departments of the civil government. 

 A brief summary of excerpts from the Baha'i Writings will show that nonparticipation in political affairs is one of the basic axioms of Baha'i action. 

 The keynote to this theme may be found in the Writings of Baha'u'llah. He has stated: That one indeed is a man who, today, dedi-cateth himself to the service of the entire human race. 

 The Great Being saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds ofthe earth. In another passage He hath pro.claimed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens. 

 Sow not the seeds of discord among men, and refrain from contending with your neighbour Open, 0 people, the city ofthe human heart with the key of your utterance.. 

 That which beseemeth you is the love of God, and the love of Him Who is the Manifestation of His Essence, and the observance of whatsoever He clicoseth to prescribe Unto yOU, did ye but know it. Say.' Let truthfulness and courtesy be your adorning. 

 Suffer not yourselves to be deprived of the robe of forbearance and justice, that the sweet savours of holiness may be wafted from your hearts upon all created things. 

 Say: Beware, o people of Baha, lest ye walk in the ways of them whose words differ from their deeds. Strive that ye may be enabled to manifest to the peoples of the earth the signs of God, and to Gleanings from the Writings of Rahd'u'!ldh, p. 250. 
mirror forth His commandments.

 Let your acts be a guide unto all mankind, for the professions of most men, be they high or low, differ from their conduct. It is through your deeds that ye can distinguish yourselves from others. Through them the brightness of your light can be shed upon the whole earth. 

 The aim of the Faith is to produce the reality of virtue in souls and evolve institutions capable of dealing with social matters justly, in the light of the revealed truths. 

 This is entirely distinct from the province filled by partisan civil institutions. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha counselled the Baha'is from the early beginnings of the American Baha'i community not to discuss political affairs. 

 All conferences (i.e., all consultation and discussion) must be regarding the matters of benefit, both as a whole and individually, such as the guarding of all in all cases, their pro tec-tion  and preservation, the improvement of character, the training of children, etc. If any person wishes to speak of government affairs, or to interfere with the order of government, the others must not combine with him because the Cause of God is withdrawn entirely from political affairs; the political realm pertains only to the Rulers of those matters; it has nothing to do with the souls who are exerting their utmost energy to harmonizing affairs, helping character and inciting (the people) to strive for perfections. 

 Therefore no soul is allowed to interfere with (political) matters, but only in that which is commanded.3 

 With the development of a worldwide administrative structure within the Baha'i Faith, institutions have been set up in national and local areas which assure the unity and integrity of the Faith. In unfolding these 2 ibid., pp. 303 — 305.

  administrative institutions Shoghi Effendi has reiterated the importance of the nonpolitical character of the Baha'i teachings in a letter written 21 March 1932, to the Baha'is of the United States and 

Canada:                    

 'I feel it, therefore, incumbent upon me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance of an instruction which, at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application  to the East or to the West. 

 And this principle  is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as Local or National Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, eitlwr directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 Whether it be in the publications which they initiate and supervise; or in their official and public deliberations; or in the posts they occupy and the services they render; or in the communications they address to their fellow-disciples; or in their dealings with men of eminence and authority; or in their affiliations with kindred societies and organizations,  it is, I am firmly convinced, their first and sacred obligation to abstain from any word or deed that might be construed as a violation of this vital principle. Theirs is the duty to demonstrate, on one hand, their unqualified loyalty and obedience to whatever is the considered judgement of their respective governments. 

 'Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective nations, with the policies of theft governments and the schemes and programmes of parties and factions. 

 In such controversies they should assign no blame, take no side, further no design, and identify themselves with no system prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide Fellowship  which it is their aim to guard and foster. Let them beware lest they allow themselves to become the tools of unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious among their countrymen. 

 Let them so shape their lives and regulate their conduct that no charge of secrecy,  of fraud, of bribery, or of intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought against them. 

 Let them rise above all particularism and partisanship, above the vain disputes, the petty calculations, the transient passions that agitate the face, and engage the attention, of a changing world. It is their duty to strive to distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed with the aid of their elected representatives,  such posts and functions as are either diplomatic or political from those that are purely administrative in character, and which under no circumstances are affected by the changes and chances that political activities and party government, in every land, must necessarily involve. Let them affirm their unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God's immutable Purpose  for all men. 

 'It should be made unmistakably clear that such an attitude implies neither the slightest indifference to the cause and interests of their own country, nor involves ahy insubordination on their part to the authority of recognized and established governments. Nor does it constitute  a repudiation of their sacred obligation to promote, in the most effective manner, the best interests of their government and people. 

 It indicates the desire cherished by every true and Loyal follower of Baha'u'llah to serve, in an unselfish, unostentatious and patriotic fashion, the highest interests of the country to which he belongs, and in a way that would entail no departure from the high standards of integrity and truthfulness associated with the teachings of his Faith. 

 'As the number of the Baha'i communities in various parts of the world multiplies and their power, as a social force, becomes increasingly apparent, they will no doubt find themselves increasingly subjected to the pressure which men of authority and influence, in the political domain, will exercise in the hope of obtaining the support they require for the adyancement of their aims. 

 These communities will moreover,  feel a growing need of the goodwill and the assistance of their respective governments in their efforts to widen the scope, and to consolidate the foundations, of the institutions committed to their charge. Let them beware lest, in their eagerness to further the aims of their beloved Cause, they should be led unwittingly  to bargain with their Faith, to compro

THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH    591

  misc with their essential principles, or to sacrifice, in return for any material advantage which their institutions may derive, the integrity  of their spiritual ideals. Let them proclaim that in whatever country they reside, and however  advanced their institutions, or profound their desire to enforce the laws, and apply the principles, enunciated by Baha'u'llah, they will, unhesitatingly, subordinate the operation of such laws and the application of such principles  to the requirements and legal enactments of their respective governments. 

 Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavouring to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country's constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries. 

 'It should also be borne in mind that the very extension of the activities in which we are engaged, and the variety of the communities which labour under divers forms of government  so essentially different in their standards, policies, and methods, make it absolutely essential for all those who are the declared members of any one of these communities to avoid any action that might, by arousing the suspicion or exciting the antagonism of any one government, involve their brethren in fresh persecutions or complicate the nature of their task. How else, might I ask, could such a far-flung  Faith, which transcends political and social boundaries, which includes within its pale so great a variety of races and nations, which will have to rely increasingly, as it forges ahead, on the good will and support of the diversified and contending governments of the earth — how else could such a Faith succeed in preserving its unity, in safeguarding its interests, and in ensuring the steady and peaceful development of its institutions? 

 'Such an attitude, however, is not dictated by considerations of selfish expediency, but is actuated, first and foremost, by the broad principle  that the followers of Baha'u'llah will, under no circumstances, suffer themselves to be involved, whether as individuals or in their collective capacities, in matters that would entail the slightest departure from the fundamental  verities and ideals of their Faith. Neither the charges which the uninformed and the malicious may be led to bring against them, nor the allurements of honours and rewards, will ever induce them to surrender their trust or to deviate from their path. Let their words proclaim, and their conduct testify, that they who follow Baha'u'llah, in whatever land they reside, are actuated by no selfish ambition, that they neither thirst for power, nor mind any wave of unpopularity, of distrust or criticism, which a strict adherence to their standards might provoke.'1 

   And again: 'The Baha      

 Faith as it forges ahead throughout the western world and particularly in lands where the political machinery is corrupt and political passions and prejudices are dominant among the masses, should increasingly assert and demonstrate the fact that it is nonpolitical in character, that it stands above the party, that it is neither apathetic to national interests nor opposed to any party or faction, and that it seeks through administrative channels, rather than through diplomatic and political posts to establish, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the capacity, the sane patriotism, the integrity and high-mindedness  of its avowed adherents. 

 This is the general and vital principle; it is for the National representatives to apply it with fidelity and vigour.'2 These instructions raised the question whether Baha'is should vote in any public election.  A Tablet revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to Mr. Thornton Chase was sent to the Guardian, and the following reply was received, dated 26 January 1933: 'The Guardian fully recognizes the authenticity  and controlling influence of this instruction  from 'Abdu'l-Baha upon the question. He, however, feels under the responsibility of stating  that the attitude taken by the Master (that is, that American citizens are in duty bound to vote in public elections) implies certain reservations. 

 He, therefore, lays it upon the individual  conscience to see that in following the Master's instructions no Baha'i vote for an officer nor Baha'i participation in the affairs of the Republic shall involve acceptance by that individual of a programme or policy that contravenes  any vital principle, spiritual or social, of the Faith.' 

 The Guardian added to this letter the following postscript: 'I feel it incumbent upon me to clarify the above statement, written The World Order of Baha'u'llah, pp. 64 — 67. 

 2 U.S. Bah4'( News, December 1932.

  in my behalf, by stating that no vote cast, or office undertaken, by a Baha'i should necessarily  constitute acceptance, by the voter or office holder, of the entire programme of any political  party. No Baha'i can be regarded as either a Republican or Democrat, as such. He is, above all else, the supporter of the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, with which, I am firmly convinced, the programme of no political party is completely harmonious." 

 In a letter dated 16 March 1933, the Guardian  sent these further details: 'As regards the nonpolitical character of the Baha'i 

Faith, Shoghi Effendi      

 feels that there is no contradiction whatsoever between the Tablet  (to Thornton Chase, referred to above) and the reservations to which he has referred. 

 The Master surely never desired the friends to use their influence towards the realization and promotion of pohcies contrary to any of the principles of the Faith. The friends may vote, if they can do it, without identifying themselves with one party or another. To enter the arena of party politics is surely detrimental to the best interests of the Faith and will harm the Cause. It remains for the individuals to so use their right to vote as to keep aloof from party politics, and always bear in mind that they are voting on the merits of the individual, rather than because he belongs to one party or another. The matter must be made perfectly clear to the individuals, who will be left free to exercise their discretion and judgement. But if a certain person does enter into party politics and labours for the ascendancy of one party over another, and continues to do it against the expressed appeals and warnings of the Assembly,  then the Assembly has the right to refuse him the right to vote in Baha'i elections.'2 That this principle, as do all Baha'i principles, has worldwide application is made clear by Shoghi Effendi in a letter dated 

11 March                   
1936.                      

    'The Faith of Baha'u'llah  

 has assimilated, by virtue of its creative, its reguhtive and ennobling energies, the varied races, nationalities, creeds and classes that have sought its shadow, and have pledged unswerving fealty to its cause. 

 It has changed the hearts of its adherents, burned away their prejudices, stilled their passions, exalted their concep-'U.S.  Baha'( News, April 1933.

 tions, ennobled their motives, coordinated their efforts, and transformed their outlook. While preserving their patriotism and safeguarding their lesser loyalties, it has made them lovers of mankind, and the determined upholders of its best and truest interests. While maintaining intact their belief in the Divine origin of their respective religions, it has enabled them to visualize the underlying purpose  of these religions, to discover their merits, to recognize their sequence, their interdependence, their wholeness and unity and to acknowledge  the bond that vitally links them to itself. This universal, this transcending love which the followers of the Baha'i Faith feel for their fellowmen, of whatever race, creed, class or nation, is neither mysterious nor can it be said to have been artificially stimulated. It is both spontaneous and genuine. 

 They whose hearts are warmed by the energizing influence of God's creative love cherish His creatures for His sake, and recognize in every human face a sign of His reflected glory. 

 'Of such men and women it may be truly said that to them "every foreign land is a fatherland, and every fatherland a foreign land." For their citizenship, it must be remembered, is in the 

Kingdom of Baha'u'llah.    

 Though willing to share to the utmost the temporal benefits and the fleeting joys which this earthly life can confer,  though eager to participate in whatever activity that conduces to the richness, the happiness  and peace of that life, they can, at no time, forget that it constitutes no more than a transient, a very brief stage of their existence, that they who live it are but pilgrims and wayfarers whose goal is the Celestial City, and whose home the Country of never-failing joy and brightness. 

 'Though loyal to their respective governments, though profoundly interested in anything that affects their security and welfare, though anxious to share in whatever promotes their best interests, the Faith with which the followers  of Baha'u'llah stand identified is one which they firmly believe God has raised high above the storms, the divisions, and controversies  of the political arena. 

 Their Faith they conceive to be essentially nonpolitical, supranational  in character, rigidly nonpartisan, and entirely dissociated from nationalistic ambitions, pursuits and purposes. 

 Such a Faith knows no division of class or of party. It sub

  ordinates, without hesitation or equivocation, every particularistic interest, be it personal, regional, or national to the paramount interests of humanity, firmly convinced that in a world of interdependent peoples and nations the advantage  of the part is best to be reached by the advantage of the whole, and that no abiding benefit can be conferred upon the component parts if the general interests of the entity itself are ignored or neglected.'1 The unity of Baha'i action throughout the world is further emphasized in a letter from Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Vienna, written  in 1947 through his secretary, in which he said in part: 'We Baha'is are one the world over; we are seeking to build up a new world order, divine in origin. 

 How can we do this if every Baha is a member of a different political party —  some of them diametrically opposite to each other? Where is our unity then? We would be divided because of politics, against ourselves and this is the opposite of our purpose. 

 Obviously if one Baha'i in Austria is given freedom to choose a political party and join it, however good its aims may be, another Baha'i in Japan or America, or India, has the right to do the same thing and he might belong to a party the very opposite in principle to that which the Austrian Baha'i belongs to. Where would be the unity of the Faith then? These two spiritual brothers would be working against each other because of their political affiliations (as the Christians of Europe have been doing in so many fratrici-tial wars). The best way for a Baha'i to serve his country and the world is to work for the establishment of Baha'u'llah's World Order, which will gradually unite all men and do away with divisive political systems and religious creeds In the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha the Baha'is are instructed to obey and be the well-wishers of the governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king as disloyaltylo God Himself and wishing evil to the government  a transgression of the Cause of God.3 

 In explanation of this statement the Guardian wrote, in a letter dated 3 July 1948: 'Regarding your question about politics and the Master's Will: the attitude of the Baha'is must be twofold, complete obedience to the 'The World Order of Baha'u'llah, pp. 197 — 198. 2 U.S. Ba/id'!

 government of the country they reside in, and no interference whatsoever in political matters or questions. What the Master's statement really means is obedience to a duly constituted government, whatever that government may be in form. We are not the ones, as individual Baha'is, to judge our government as just or unjust — for each believer would be sure to hold a different viewpoint, and within our own Baha'i fold a hotbed of dissension would spring up and destroy our unity. We must build up our Baha'i system, and leave the faulty systems of the world to go their way. We cannot change them through becoming involved in them; on the contrary, they will destroy us.'4 Another application of this principle con~ cerns the right, propriety or usefulness of exerting Baha influence for the enactment of legislative measures reflecting more or less the purpose  of some Baha'i principle or teaching. For example, should a Baha'i community, local or national, lend the name of the Baha'i Faith to support legislation which seeks to abolish race and religious discrimination in matters of industrial employment, or intervene when measures concerning military training of youth are before a legislature? 

  The National Spiritual    

 Assembly of the• Baha'is of the United States has stated that, 'as a general policy subject to the Guardian's specific direction in special cases, Baha'is and their administrative institutions should not feel obligated to adopt a "Baha'i" attitude or course of action on matters of civil legislation. Our teachings and basic principles speak for themselves. 

 These we can always declare and set forth with all possible energy whenever occasions arise. But a truth which is sundered from its sustaining spiritual Source, lifted out of its organic relationship to the Baha'i community, broken off from the other truths, and made subject to the storm and stress of secular controversy, is no longer a truth with which we can usefully have concern. It has become an enactment to be carried out by institutions and groups committed to other enactments, other aims and purposes and methods not in conformity  with the "Divine Polity" entrusted to those alone who give full loyalty to Baha'u'llah. 

 Far better for us to strive to mirror forth radiantly the individual and community virtues of a new era than to hope that others than U.S. Baha'( News, January 1949.

Baha'i."                   

 Shoghi Effendi points out, as a guiding principle of Baha'i conduct, that 'in connection with their administrative activities, no matter how grievously interference with them might affect the course of the extension of the Movement, and the suspension of which does not constitute in itself a departure from the principle of Loyalty to their Faith, the considered  judgement and authoritative decrees issued by their responsible rulers must, if they be faithful to Baha'u'llah's and 'Abdu'l-Baha's  express injunctions, be thoroughly respected and loyally obeyed. In matters, however,  that vitally affect the integrity and honour of the Faith of Baha'u'llah and are tantamount to a recantation of their faith and repudiation of their innermost belief, they [the BaM'isj are convinced, and are unhesitatingly prepared to 'The Baha'( World, vol.

 'Small wonder if by the Pen of Baha'u'llah these pregnant words, written in anticipation of the present state of mankind, should have been revealed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the wholewo rid. The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens. 

 And again, That one indeed is a man who today dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race.

  2. THE BAHA'I VIEW OF PACIFISM

  IN a letter published in U.S. Baha'( News, January 1938, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha Faith wrote through his secretary: 'With reference to the absolute pacifists or conscientious objectors to war: their attitude, judged from the Baha'i standpoint, is quite antisocial and due to its exaltation of the individual  conscience leads inevitably to disorder and chaos in society. Extreme pacifists are thus very close to anarchists, in the sense that both of these groups lay an undue emphasis on the rights and merits of the individual. 

 The Baha'i conception of social life is essentially based on the subordination of the individual will to that of society. It neither suppresses the individual nor does it exalt him to the point of making him an antisocial creature, a menace to society. 

 As in everything, it follows the "golden mean." The only way society can function is for the minority to follow the will of the majority. 

 'The other main objection to the conscientious objectors is that their method of establishing peace is too negative. 

 Noncooperation is too passive a philosophy to become an effective way for social reconstruction. 

 Their refusal to bear arms can never establish peace. There should first be a spiritual revitalization which nothing, except the Cause of God, can effectively  bring to every man's heart.' 
                          
            3. SUMMARY OF THE GUARDIAN'S
         INSTRUCTIONS ON THE OBLIGATIONS OF
        BAHA'IS IN CONNECTION WITH MILITARY
                      SERVICE

  IMMEDIATELY prior to World War lithe Baha'i position on military training and service,  and the obligation of individual Baha'is to apply for and maintain a noncombatant status when this is possible under the laws of their country, were clearly stated by the Guardian of the Faith. 

 On 27 November 1938 he instructed his secretary to write to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles: 'He has noted your Assembly's request for his advice as to what forms of national service the friends may volunteer for in times of emergency. 

 While the believers, he feels, should exert every effort to obtain from the authorities a permit exempting them from active military service in a combatant  capacity, it is their duty at the same time, as loyal and devoted citizens, to offer their services to their country in any field of national service which is not specifically aggressive or directly military. Such forms of national work as air raid precaution service, ambulance corps, and other humanitarian work or activity of a noncombatant nature, are the most suitable  types of service the friends can render, and which they should gladly volunteer for, since in addition to the fact that they do not involve any violation of the spirit or principle of the Teachings  they constitute a form of social and humanitarian service which the Cause holds sacred and emphatically enjoins.' 
     A further query from that 

National Spiritual Assembly

 dated 9 May 1939 evoked the following  reply on 4 June 1939, in amplification of the above principles: 'His instructions on this matter, conveyed in a letter addressed to your Assembly during last


<p597>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH    597

  November, were not intended for that particular  occasion, but were meant for present conditions,  and for any such emergencies as may arise in the immediate future. 

 'It is still his firm conviction that the believers, while expressing their readiness to unreservedly obey any directions that the authorities may issue concerning national service in time of war, should also, and while there is yet no outbreak of hostilities, appeal to the government for exemption from active military service in a combatant capacity, stressing the fact that in doing so they are not prompted by any selfish considerations, but by the sole and supreme motive of upholding the Teachings of their Faith, which make it a moral obligation for them to desist from any act that would involve them in direct warfare with their fellow-humans of any other race or nation. 

 'The Baha'i Teachings, indeed, condemn, emphatically and unequivocally, any form of physical violence, and warfare in the battlefield is obviously a form, and perhaps the worst form which such violence can assume. 

 'There are many other avenues through which the believers can assist in times of war by enlisting in services of a noncombatant nature — services that do not involve the direct shedding of blood — such as ambulance work, anti-air raid precaution service, office and administrative works, and it is for such types of national service that they should volunteer. 

 'It is immaterial whether such activities would still expose them to dangers, either at home or in the front, since their desire is not to protect their lives, but to desist from any acts of wilful murder. 

 'The friends should consider it their conscientious duty, as loyal members of the Faith, to apply for such exemption, even though there may be slight prospect of their obtaining the consent and approval of the authorities to their petition.' 
    After the war, on 20 July 

1946, the National Spiritual

 Assembly of the United States enquired of the Guardian whether the existence  of the United Nations in its present form changed the attitude of the Baha toward military duties which might require the taking of human life. 

 The Guardian's reply, written by his secretary, was: 'As there is neither an 

International Police Force

 nor any immediate prospect of one coming  into being, the Baha should continue to apply, under all circumstances, for exemption from any military duty that necessitates the taking  of life. There is no justification for any change of attitude on our part at the present time.' 

 The Guardian therefore has made it clear that it is obligatory and not an optional matter for all Baha'is to apply for and maintain a noncombatant status if this is possible under the law. Where such a law exists, Baha cannot  voluntarily enlist in any branch of the armed forces in which they would be subject to orders to engage in the taking of human life. 

 The Universal House of Justice amplified this later statement: 'There is no objection to a Baha'i enlisting voluntarily in the armed forces of a country in order to obtain a training in some trade or profession, provided that he can do so without making himself liable to undertake combatant service. 

 'There is likewise no objection to a Baha seeking or continuing a career in the armed forces, provided that he can do so without making  himself liable to undertake combatant service.,

           BAHA'I CALENDAR, FESTIVALS AND

          DATES OF HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE

                     1. FOREWORD

  Excerpt from Baha'u'llah and the New Era by Dr J. E. Esslemont AMONG different peoples and at different times many different methods have been adopted for the measurement of time and fixing of dates, and several different calendars are still in daily use, e.g., the Gregorian in Western Europe, the Julian in many countries of Eastern Europe, the Hebrew among the Jews and the Muhammadan in Muslim countries. 

 The BTh signalized the importance of the dispensation which He came to herald by inaugurating a new calendar. In this, as in the Gregorian Calendar, the lunar month is abandoned and the solar year is adopted. 

 The Baha'i year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e., 361 days), with the addition of certain 'intercalary days' (four in ordinary and five in leap years) between the eighteenth and nineteenth months in order to adjust the calendar to the solar year. The Bab named the months after the attributes of God. The Baha'i New Year, like the ancient Persian New Year, is astronomically fixed, commencing at the March equinox (21 March), and the Baha'i era commences with the year of the Bab's declaration (i.e., 1844 AD., 1260 All.). 

 In the not far distant future it will be necessary that all peoples in the world agree on a common calendar. 

 It seems, therefore, fitting that the new age of unity should have a new calendar free from the objections and associations which make each of the older calendars unacceptable to large sections of the world's population, and it is difficult to see how any other arrangement could exceed in simplicity and convenience that proposed by the Bab.

                 SHOULD BE SUSPENDED

  The first day of Ridvan, The ninth day of Ridvan, The twelfth day of Ridvan, The anniversary of the declaration of the BTh, The anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah The anniversary of the birth of the Bin, The anniversary of the ascension of Baha'u'llah, The anniversary of the martyrdom of the BTh The feast of Naw-Riiz. 

  NOTE: 'Abdu'l-Baha, in one of His Tablets addressed to a believer of Nayriz, Persia, has written the following: Nine days in the year have been appointed on which work is forbidden. Some of these days have been specifically mentioned in the Book. The rest follow as corollaries to the Text.. Work on the Day of the Covenant (Fete Day of 'Abdu'l-Baha), however, is not prohibited. Celebration of that day is left to the discretion of the friends. Its observation is not obligatory. The days pertaining to the Abh~ Beauty (Baha'u'llah) and the Primal Point (the B~b), that is to say these nine days, are the only ones on which work connected with trade, commerce, industry and agriculture is not allowed. In like manner, work connected with any form of employment, whether governmental or otherwise, should be suspended. 

  As a corollary of this Tablet it follows that the anniversaries of the birth and ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha are not to be regarded as days on which work is prohibited. The celebration of these two days, however, is obligatory. 

  Baha'is in East and West, holding administrative positions, whether public or private, should exert the utmost effort to obtain special leave from their superiors to enable them to observe these nine holy days. 

         4. ADDITIONAL MATERIAL GLEANED FROM
          NAB IL'S NARRATIVE REGARDING THE
                   BAHA'I CALENDAR

THE Badi' Calendar (Baha'i  

 Calendar) has been taken by me from the Kitd b-i-AsmtV , one of the works written by the Bab. As I have observed in these days that certain believers are inclined to regard the year in which Baha'u'llah  departed from Ba~d~td to Constantinople as marking the beginning of the Badi' Calendar, I have requested Mirza Aq~ Jan, the amanuensis of Baha'u'llah, to ascertain His will and desire concerning this matter. Baha'u'llah answered and said: 'The year sixty A.H.1 
'(i.e., 1260 All.)         

 (1844 A.D.), the year of the Declaration of the BTh, must be regarded as the beginning of the Badi' 

Calendar.' The Declaration 

 of the B~b took place on the evening preceding the fifth day of Jam~dfyu'1-Avva1, of the year 1260 A.H. It has been ordained that the solar calendar be followed and that the vernal Equinox, the day of Nawruz, be regarded as the New Year's Day of the Badf' Calendar. 

 The year sixty, in which the fifth day of Jam~dfyu'1-Avva1 coincided  with the sixty-fifth day after Nawruz, has accordingly been regarded as the first year

 As in that year, the day of Nawruz, the vernal Equinox, preceded by sixty-six days the date of the Declaration of the Bab, I have therefore, throughout my history, regarded the Naw-Rflz of the year sixty-one A.H. (the Nawruz immediately following the Declaration of the Mb) as the first Nawruz of the Badi' Calendar. 

 I have accordingly considered the Nawruz of this present year, the year 1306 A.H., which is the 47th solar year after the Declaration of the BTh, as the 46th Naw-Rflz of the Badi' Calendar. 

                     Soon after Baha'u'llah    

 had Left the fortress of 'Akka and was dwelling in the house of Malik, in that city, He commanded me to transcribe the text of the Badf' Calendar and to instruct the believers in its details. On the very day in which I received His command, I composed, in verse and prose, an exposition of the main features of that Calendar and presented it to him.

  March inclusive — The first day of each month is thus the day of   ing of 19 months of 19 days each, with the Baha, and th& last day of each month the day of   addition of certain intercalary days. He has 'Airt'.named the New Year's Day, which is the day of The Bab has regarded the solar year, of 365     Nawruz, the day of Baha, of the month of days, 5 hours, and fifty odd minutes, as consist-BaM.  He has ordained the month of 'AlA' to be


<p601>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U                the month of fasting, and has decreed that the day of Nawruz should mark the termination of that period. As the Mb did not specifically define the place for the four days and the fraction of a day in the BadlY Calendar, the people of the Baydn were at a loss as to how they should regard them. The revelation of the Kitd b-i-A qdas in the city of 'Akka resolved this problem and settled the issue. 

 Baha'u'llah designated those days as the Ayy~m-i-HA and ordained that they should immediately precede the month of 'AlA', which is the month of fasting. 

 He enjoined upon His followers to devote these days tq feasting, rejoicing, and charity. Imitiediately upon the termination of these intercalary days, Baha'u'llah ordained the month of fasting to begin. 

 I have heard it stated that some of the people of the Baydn, the followers of Mirza Ya~yA, have regarded these intercalary days as coming immediately after the month of 'AIW, thus terminating their fast five days before the day of Naw-Rfiz. This, notwithstanding the explicit text of the Baydn which states that the day of Nawruz must needs be the first day of the month of Bah6, and must follow immediately after the last day of the month of 'AU.'. Others, aware of this contradiction, have started their fasting on the fifth day of the month of 'A1&, and included the intercalary days within the period of fasting. 

 Every fourth year the number of the intercalary days is raised from four to five. The day of Nawruz falls on the 21st of March only if the vernal Equinox precedes the setting of the sun on that day. Should the vernal Equinox take place after sunset, Nawruz will have to be celebrated on the following day. 

 The Bab has, moreover, in His Writings revealed in the Arabic tongue, divided the years following the date of His Revelation into cycles of nineteen years each. The names of the years in each cycle are as follows: 

1.  Alif                   
2.  BA'                    
3.  Ab

Most Luminous.             
Unity.                     

 Each cycle of nineteen years is called VThid. 

 Nineteen cycles constitute a period called Kull-i-Shay'. The numerical value of the word V6hid is nineteen, that of Kull-i-Shay' is 361. 

 VM?id signifies unity, and is symbolic of the unity of God. 

 The Bab has, moreover, stated that this system of His is dependent upon the acceptance and good-pleasure of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest'. One word from Him would suffice either to establish it for all time, or to annul it forever. 

 For instance, the date of the 21st of April, 1930, which is the first day of Ridvan, and which according to the Kitab-i-Aqdas must coincide with the 'thirteenth day of the second Baha'i month,' and which fell this year (1930) on Monday, would, according to the system of the Badi' Calendar, be describbd as follows: 'The day of KamAl, the day of Qudrat, of the month of JalAl, of the year Baha'i, of the fifth VAhid, of the first Ku11-i-~ay'.'

IN MEMORIAM

  ADELBERT MUHLSCHLEGEL      

 1897 — 1 980  

On 16 October 1920 'Abdu'l-Baha.
addressed the following    

Tablet to Adelbert Miihlschlegel:
    0 thou son of the Kingdom! 
Thy letter hath been received.

 It was like unto a bag of musk. When I opened it, the fragrance of the love of God was perceived. 

 It is my hope that thy rivulet may develop into a sea and surge with the breezes of divine guidance, casting a wave to the East and another to the West. 

 Be thou deeply thankful to thy teacher and show unto her heartfelt and spiritual gratitude, because it was she who caused thee to hear the divine call and it was through her that thou didst attain to eternal grace. Thou wert earthly and thou becamest heavenly, thou wert in darkness and thou didst attain illumination; thou wert of the world of matter and thou becamest divine, and thou didst obtain a portion and share of the eternal bestowal. 

 Be filled with happiness and derive joy from the melody of the Supreme 

Concourse!                

 It is my hope that thou wilt follow in the path of Baha'u'llah. Thine honoured wtfe will be favoured at the threshold of Oneness and looked upon with the eyes of the merciful Lord. Upon thee be the Glory of the All-Glorious. 

 This hope of 'Abdu'l-Baha that Adelbert Muhlschlegel would walk in the path of Baha'u'llah came true and he continued in this path devotedly to the end of his life. He was born on 16 June 1897 in Berlin. His father was a military doctor in the service of the King of Wurttemberg, which influenced young Adelbert's choice of profession. His mother was the daughter of the pastor of Biberach, and she passed on to her son the longing for spiritual values. Adelbert described his childhood, part of which was spent in Stuttgart, as a cheerful one. He lived for many years in a house with a large garden. His parents gave him much love and attention. 

 He had the example of his mother's pious and radiant soul as well as his father's discipline and encouragement in sports. In addition, he had a charming little sister who later emigrated to eastern Europe and accepted  the Faith there. 

   During World War I Adelbert

 served in the medical corps and struggled to harmonize within himself the hard facts of medicine with the longing for spiritual enlightenment. His medical studies took him to Freiburg, 

Greifs-wald  and Tubingen. 

 He grew increasingly convinced that a new era was coming into being and he became a true seeker. In 1920 he received a letter from his mother in which she said that she had found a new and universal Cause, the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 He studied the few texts which were available at that time, realized that it was the truth he had been searching for, and accepted the 

Faith.                     

 In 1922 he opened his first medical practice, in Stuttgart. There followed a time of inner struggle to harmonize his profession and his private life with the Teachings. He participated in the community life of Stuttgart, gave talks and wrote a melodrama for the third 'Baha'i Congress', held in September 1924. Two years later he married Herma Weidle, They had two girls and three boys of whom one died in early childhood. Herma was a radiant mother and Adelbert's close companion in all his Baha'i activities until she was called to the Abh6 Kingdom in 1964.1 

 They had the great privilege of making a pilgrimage together in 1936 and of being in the presence of Shoghi Effendi who walked alone with Adelbert for a quarter of an hour in the gardens. 

 Then came the time in 1937 when the Faith was prohibited in Germany. 

 Throughout the years of the Second World War Adelbert remained with his family in Stuttgart, as a doctor. Their apartment was bombed. In 1945, in their new home, Adelbert and Herma created a true centre for Baha'i activities and, in addition, a place to which many young Iranian Baha'is turned upon their arrival in Germany. A warm atmosphere full of humour enveloped everyone. 

 If any material difficulty arose, as was not unusual in those post1

 Adelbert Miihlschlegel    

  war years, Adelbert would compose a song making light of the problem. 

 He continued to provide translations of Baha'i literature and widened his working knowledge of a number of European languages. He wrote many articles  on Baha'i subjects that appeared in various publications. 

 For many years — and until January 1958 — he served as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria, and was often its chairman. 

        In February 1952 Adelbert 

 Mflhisehiegel was appointed a Hand of the Cause of God and from 1959 devoted his entire time. 
to service to the Faith.  

 In 1957 a profound spiritual experience deeply affected him, preparing  him for a life of complete dedication to service to Baha'u'llah. 

 In that year, when the beloved Guardian passed away, 

Abdu'l-Baha  R6hfyyih    
Khdnum asked Adelbert     

 to wash the body of Shoghi Effendi before interment. 

 This experience is best described in his own words: 'Something new happened to me in that hour that I cannot, even after a few days, speak of, but I can mention the wisdom and love that I felt pour over me. 

 In that room —  which to worldly eyes would have appeared so different — there was a tremendous spiritual force such as I have oniy felt in my life in the holy Shrines. My first impression was the contrast between the body left behind and the majestic, transfigured face, a soul-stirring picture of the joyous victory of the eternal over the transient. My second impression, as I prayed and thought and carefully did what I had to do, was that in this degree of consecration to the work of God I should work all my life, and mankind should work a thousand years, in order to construct "the Kingdom" on earth; and my third thought was, as I washed each member of his body and anointed it, that I thanked those beloved hands which had worked and written to establish the Covenant, those feet that had walked for us, that mouth that had spoken to us, that head that had thought for us, and I prayed and meditated and supplicated that in the short time left to me, the members of my body might hasten to follow in his path of service; and my last thought was of my own distress because I felt how unworthy my hands were to anoint that blessed brow with attar-of-rose  as the Masters of old were wont to do to their pupils; and yet what privileges, what duties fall to us, the living, to watch over what is past and mortal, be it ever so exalted. A great deal of mercy, love, and wisdom were hidden in this hour.'1 The Hand of the Cause 

Adelbert Mull-schiegel    

 was one of the Chief Stewards of the Cause who guided it through the dark corridor from 1957 to 1963 when the 

Universal House of Justice

 was elected. During this time he visited many European countries, assisting in increasing the number of National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 there from three, in 1953, to sixteen, in 1963. In 1958 Dr. Mtihlschlegel and his wife pioneered from Stuttgart to various centres and finally to Ttibingen where Herma passed away in 1964 following a long and severe illness during which she was cared for by her husband. 

 A shining light had left this world to continue her services in another realm, and to assist her dear husband in this one. 

 After the death of his wife in 1964 Dr. Mfihlschlegel moved to Vienna to help consolidate  this still struggling national corn-See See The Baha World, vol. XIII, pp. 218 — 219.

IN MEMORIAM                613

  munity, The secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly was Ursula Kohler who, a year later, became his wife and close collaborator. Then in 1970, when Switzerland needed heLp to open one of its French-speaking cantons, Dr. Mflhlschlegel registered in the University of Fribourg in order to obtain his residence permit. 

 Soon a healthy community was established  in Fribourg with his help and that of his wife. From Austria and Switzerland his travels in Europe continued. When, in 1968, the Hands of the Cause were freed to serve on a worldwide basis through the establishment of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, Dr. Miihlschlegel made his first trip to other continents. In 1969, at the request of the Universal House of Jusfice, he journeyed to Asia, visiting Persia, India, West Pakistan (now 

Bangladesh) and Nepal.    

 Having achieved his purpose in Switzerland, Dr. Mfihlschlegel and his wife moved in 1974, at the suggestion of the House of Justice, to Hoffleim, Germany, very close to the Mother Temple of Europe. Again their home became a centre of Baha hospitality enriched by the great wisdom of Dr. Mfihlschlegel who shared his knowledge with the visiting friends. 

 In addition, he travelled to Africa in 1971 and 1972, and to South America in 1975. During these long trips he was accompanied by his wife, and although his heart was beginning to fail, he yet felt that he could render stilL another service by moving to a new country —  the source of the classical tradition so dear to his heart, namely Greece. And so in 1977, at the age of eighty, he settled, with Ursula, in their last pioneer post, Athens. 

The first National Spiritual

 Assembly of Greece was elected that year. 

 Now came a time of spiritual maturity for Dr. Miihlschlegel, The harmony of his home attracted friends from near and far, and all drew benefit from his combination of love and wisdom. Restricted in his travels, this faithful servant of the Cause devoted his time to study and to the preparation of a book concerning the achievement of maturity in the Cause. God took the pen from his hand before this work could go to the printer. However, his wife, Ursula, intends to complete for him this last effort of service. On 

29 July 1980 the Hand     

 of the Cause of God Adelbert Muhl-schlegel  joined his BeLoved and his loved ones in the AbhA Kingdom, leaving his wife, Ursula, to continue serving, assisted by him from on high. LIe is buried on the shores of the Mediterranean whose waters lap his rest-ing-place and the shores of the Holy Land, which he so often visited to pray at the holy Shrines. Dr. Miihlschlegel had delighted a great number of friends with his poems; in 1977 a collection of these was published by the Baha Publishing Trust of Germany, commemorating  his eightieth birthday. His last poem describes his dedication to the essence of life. 

 A copy appears in the original German in the poetry section of this volume of the international record. 

 The Universal House of Justice informed the Baha world of his passing in its cable of 29 July:

  and women who have given their Lives to promoting the new Message and who have become stars in the new heaven, second only in brilliance to those original Companions, Apostles, Letters, attendant upon the Prophet Himself during His earthly sojourn. 
Such a one was Paul Haney. 

 He was born of Baha'i parents on 20 August 1909, during the ministry of 'Abdu'1-l3abA and his mother confided in writing to Abdu'l-Baha  Rhhiyyih KhAnum 'I was carrying him when we were in the presence of the Master in the Most Great Prison in 'Akka in 1909 — and I have always felt he was destined for the Cause.' 

 Paul always maintained that this was his first pilgrimage. 
    Mary Ida Parkhurst and     

Charles Freeborn Haney     

 were married in 1893 and became Baha'is in 1900. They were both of true, Godfearing, religious stock, Charles's father having been a wellknown Methodist minister in Illinois, and one of the six founders of Northwestern University, in Evanston. 

 His grandson, Paul, benefited from the provision in perpetuity of scholarships for descendants of the six. Not until nine years after their recognition of Baha'u'llah, and in the seventeenth  year of their marriage, was Paul born, the only child of parents already immortalized as among the handful of first believers in the American continent. Prom the day they embraced  the Faith, the whole life of the Haneys revolved about 'Abdu'l-Baha; to serve Him, to consult Him, to be sure they were fulfilling His wishes, to receive His good pleasure, was their all in all. It was 'Abdu'l-Baha 

Who called Mary Haney      

 'Mariam', a name she henceforth used all her life. This complete orientation to the Centre of the Covenant became foi Paul — indeed for all that generation  of Baha'i children — the primary relationship in life. 

 We know little of the effect of prenatal influences on the soul and not enough about those of childhood, but the indications are that it woffid be hard to overstate them. Paul's entire environment, from that first embryonic visit to the Master, was entirely Baha'i, focused on the Centre of the Covenant and later on the Guardian. 

 Mariam wrote, 'Almost immediately after he was born the Master gave him His own name — Abdul Baha — He also gave him the name Paul', and Corinne True confirmed, in a letter to Mariam from 

Alexandria on 19 November  

 1919, that she had asked the Master 'if He had given the name Abdul Baha to Paul as had been reported to you and He confirmed what you were given. Paul for the outside world. 
His real name is Abdul     

Baha.'                     

 Many Tablets from the Master to Mariam refer to Paul. The newly born babe is blessed, and acceptable in the Divine Kingdom. 

 He is a servant of the Blessed Perfection and belonged-i to Him. Thank God for having been confirmed to attain such a blessing     I ask God that my namesake, Abdu'l-Baha, may grow and develop day by day and that his radiant face may be illumined with the light of the greatest bestowal. It was also noted that. 

 thy dear son, Paul, feeleth greatly attracted to the Kingdom of Abhd. This news imparteth the utmost ]oy and happiness Send Paul to school; I hope he will become a verdant and fresh plant in the Abhd Paradise With such showering of grace from the Centre of the Covenant and with such spiritual antecedents it was natural to expect great things from him. 

 Paul fulfilled those hopes —  even as a child. 
He was a charming boy.     

 His red hair — inherited from his mother — his blue eyes, frank and open countenance and cheerful  disposition, even his unusual height and gangling gait, delighted people and endeared him to them. May Maxwell wrote to Mariam as Paul's fifteenth birthday approached, tell me if Paul has a tennis racquet because I would like to give him one on his birthday. 

 I have a peculiar love for that dear, blessed boy.' 
     His mother adored him.     

 She referred to him in her letters as 'beloved 

Paul', 'pure-hearted Paul' 

 who 'loves everyone'; '. he is not mine any more for I have given him to the Most Great Cause.' The boy's father died when Paul was barely ten years old and Mariam raised him within the aura of her own single-minded devotion to the Master. 

 She raised him alone and under great financial stress, but surrounded him with such tender care and infused into him such complete dedication to the Centre of the Covenant, and to the Covenant itself, that service tQ the Great Cause became the one purpose of his life. 

 The loss of his father undoubtedly helped to develop in him that sense of responsibility

IN MEMORIAM               615

      Paul E. Haney              

  which was so marked a feature of his character. 

 There is a touching story from his early youth demonstrating this feeling in relationship to his beloved mother. 

On Paul's entering Central 

 High School, one of Mariam's neighbours  said to her, 'Your lovely son will not come out of school as good as he is now.' Shortly after that Paul assured his mother that she need never worry about him; he was not attracted by the wild life which so many youth feel to be a necessary proof of their manliness. There was no trace of sanctimoniousness in this attitude; he was just not attracted. There was a pure-heartedness about him which seemed an essential, unforced part of his nature. He enjoyed being decent and spiritually-minded and concerned with others. The Master's bestowal and his mother's loving education caused him to flourish spiritually. It would be hard to overestimate Mariam's influence, not only upon the development of his character but upon his chief interest in life, for she was totally involved in the work of the Cause in North America, being secretary of the National Teaching Committee from 1920 — when Paul would have been eleven — for several years onward, and took an active part in the conferences, Conventions and summer schools. In fact the first Convention for Amity between the 

Coloured and White Races   

 was held in Washington, D.C., in May 1921, where the Haneys lived. Mariam had asked the Master where she and her son could best serve the Cause, and He sent her a message through Corinne True to go to Washington, where she found a small apartment, of which she wrote, '. 

 we are both very happy and our one room apartment is a haven of rest for us both .' As a youth Paul formed a close friendship with Mary Maxwell — later Abdu'l-Baha Riihfyyih Kh4num — whom he met with other Baha'i children at the Green Acre Summer School, Conventions, and on other Baha'i occasions. 

 Before going to Northwestern University, Paul obtained work in a government office in Washington, and attended night school. When he was twenty-two years old he was appointed to the National Teaching Committee  of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, an appointment which drew forth from May Maxwell the following note: 'As for you dear Paul I feel that you bring to the National field of teaching not oniy the steadfast faith, the spirit of devotion and sacrifice which so characterized the older generation of Baha and on which foundation our beloved Cause has been established  in America, but the forward vision, the worldwide horizon, the thrilling life and motion of which our youthful Guardian is the Head and

 The Baha'i Magazine of January 1934 contains an article entitled 'The 

Economic Organization      
of Society in the New      

World Order' by Paul Edmond

 Haney, M.B.A., and is described as 'written by a young Baha'i student of economic problems Paul was by now a professional economist, having graduated from Northwestern University. 

 At this time his life revolved around his professional duties and active service to the promotion  of the 

Cause in North America.    

 He was a member of the first National Youth Committee in the United States and was constantly active in the work of the Cause. 

 In 1946 he was elected to membership of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada. Canada established its own National Spiritual Assembly in 1948 and


<p616>

  Paul remained a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, serving as its chairman from 1950 to 1957. During these years he served the National Spiritual Assembly in innumerable ways. He was chairman of the Temple Trustees 

Construction  Committee   

 for the completion of the interior of the Baha House of Worship in Wilmette; he represented the National Spiritual Assembly at the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada; in 1951 he represented the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States at the formation of the Regional 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of South America, and in 1953 at the formation of the Regional National 

Spiritual Assembly of Italy

 and Switzerland. Paul's Baha background,  his deep knowledge of the Cause, his upright and distinguished character lent prestige  to the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the United States, while at the same time his services as its chairman increased his own distinction in the Baha'i world. 

 It therefore came as no surprise when, on 19 March 1954, the following cable came to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 

States: ANNOUNCE  ALL     
NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES ELEVATION PAUL
HANEY RANK HAND OF THE     
CAUSE. The                 

  Guardian's cable to Paul himself read: ANNOUNCE 

YOUR ELEVATION HAND CAUSE  
CONFIDENT  DiVINE BLESSINGS
FUTURE SERVICES.           

  Paul's reply to the Guardian was: OVERWHELMED  OUTPOURING 

BELOVED GUARDIAN'S BOUNTY  
BESEECH PRAYERS DIVINE     
ASSISTANCE RENDER ACCEPTABLE
SERVICES RISE ABOVE FEELING 
COMPLETE UNWORTHINESS      
DEVOTED LOVE PAUL HANEY.   

  For the next three years Paul Haney's life was one of constant service in many parts of the world. 

 In April 1956, on behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, he attended the Convention of South and West Africa; in April 1957 he represented the Guardian at the first Alaskan Convention in Anchorage, where he read the message from the Guardian to that Convention. A letter from the Guardian to Mariam, during these years, contained the following passage in the section written by the Guardian's secretary: 

'He Shoghi Effendi]       

 hopes that dear Paul will ever-increasingly be able to render the Cause important services. Surely you and his father in the Abh4 Kingdom must rejoice to see how your cherished hopes are being fulfilled in this beloved son, who is so devoted, and has the interests of the Faith so completely at heart.' 

 Paul Haney, in his personal life, was unassuming, warmhearted, friendly and even-tempered.  He was a founder and one of the most popular members of the Caesaria Golf Club, where he often acted as judge in competitions and tournaments. One of the latter was an annual event for a trophy presented by the Baha'i community of Haifa. 

 In the very early 1940s, when he attended the Green Acre Summer School, he delivered a message from his beloved mother to Helen Margery Wheeler, a Baha'i from Worcester, Massachusetts. 

 They were married in 1942 on 15 July, •at Worcester, and went to live in Washington, not far from Mariam. 

 They remained there until their removal to the 

Holy Land in 1958. On      
1 September 1965 beloved Mariam

 Haney passed to the AbhA Kingdom. An account of her life may be read in The Baha'i World, vol. XIV, pp. 346 ff. 

 The year 1957 brought to all the Hands of the Cause of God the greatest crisis — and the climax — of their lives. The sudden passing of the beloved Guardian, in London, on 4 November of that year, brought instant tragedy and dismay to the heart of every Baha'i. But it was the Hands of the Cause who bore the main brunt of that bludgeon stroke, for they had been nominated, in the last message penned by Shoghi Effendi, 

'Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's
embryonic World Commonwealth'.

 Upon them fell the burden, while bearing the stress of their own unendurable heartache, of preserving the unity of the Baha'i world, reassuring the friends everywhere  and encouraging them to maintain, unabated, the magnificeHt forward march of the Cause of God which had been built up during the first four years of the beloved Guardian's 

World Crusade. Their       

 story is told in other places.1 But that was their day of immortality, when they rendered historic and effective service to the whole of humanity. After the funeral in London they gathered in Haifa, and in the Mansion at Baha, to take up their glorious labours. One of their decisions The Baha'i World, vol. XIV, pp. 431 — 435; see also Hofman, A Commentary on the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Epilogue, Rev. ed. (1982).

IN MEMORIAM                617

  was to elect nine of their members to remain in the Holy Land and serve at the World Centre of the Faith to continue the Guardian's work and bring to a successful conclusion his World Crusade with the election, in 1963, of the Universal House of Justice. Paul Haney was one of the nine elected; they were known as Hands of the Cause of God Residing in the Holy Land. 

 The great change for Paul entailed considerable sacrifice. Not only would he be separated from his beloved mother, but, in his professional life he was within sight of appointment to a very high and well-paid position. 

 It is recorded that when requested to serve in the Holy Land he bowed his head and immediately agreed. A letter from 

Mariam to Abdu'l-Baha    

 R6hiyyih KhAnum dated 12 April 1958 reads as follows: 'The beloved Paul is so pure-hearted, so conscientious, so noble a soul that when this great blessing and honor came to him — that is, of being one of the nine Hands of the Baha Cause to abide in Haifa — he said he could not live with himself had he not accepted this tremendous spiritual bounty naturally I miss Paul — the pure-hearted  — but I believe I am with him daily in his service. 

 Distance is no real separation when there is understanding and love.' 

 From now on Paul's entire life and total energies were concentrated on service to the Cause of God. He prepared the definitive statement on the Hands of the Cause of God and their activities during the interregnum between the passing of the Guardian and the election of the Universal House of Justice, which forms one of the most important items in the monumental vol. XIII of The Baha'i World, and he played his part in composing the messages of explanation and encouragement which flowed from the Custodians, as the nine Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land became known. He travelled the world as representative of the Custodians, attending 

National Conventions      

 in long-estab-lished  Baha'i communities and those inaugurating  new National 

Spiritual Assemblies.     
At the great Jubilee in   

London's Albert Hall      

 in 1963, celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Baha'u'llah and the victorious culmination of the World Crusade, he presented a significant paper on the importance of the World Centre of the Faith. 

 One of the first actions of the Universal House of Justice was to invite five Hands of the Cause to remain in the Holy Land for certain specified duties and as advisers to the House of Justice. 

 Paul Haney was one of the five. One of his first appointments was to the Editorial Committee responsible for gathering information from the entire Baha'i world and rewriting and editing it for distribution to all National Spiritual 

Assemblies. At Ridvan 1965

 he attended the fifty-sixth Annual Convention  of the United States Baha community  as the official representative of the Universal 

House Qf Justice. And     

 thereafter, Paul Haney, Hand of the Cause of God, distinguished, incorruptible, adamantine in his defence of the Covenant, sound in his judgement and greatly loved by Baha'is everywhere, travelled throughout the world as representative of the Universal House of Justice, visiting Baha'i communities and their institutions to advise, encourage and instruct. He attended diplomatic and governmental functions in Jerusalem as representative of the Baha'i World Centre. 

 Together with other Hands of the Cause he played a great part in the development of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, and later the International Teaching Centre, representing the Universal House of Justice at the inaugural gathering of the Continental 

Board of Counsellors      

 for Asia, held in New Delhi in 1981. He took part in all four International Conventions held during his lifetime, and was chairman at the opening session of the 1968 event. 

 In August 1982 he represented the House of Justice at the Continental Conference in Quito, Ecuador, followed by a meeting with the 

Board of Counsellors      

 for the Americas and attendance at the satellite conferences in 

Costa Rica and Panama.    

 On his return to the Holy Land he delighted the Baha'is at the World Centre with his characteristically jovial, spiritually uplifting and informative account of the journey. 

 On 3 December 1982 he met death suddenly  and instantly in an automobile accident. The Universal House of Justice sent the following cable to the Baha'i world:

       ENOCH OLINGA              

 1926 — 1979 Enoch Olinga came from a family of devout Christian converts taught by the Church Missionary Society, now the Native Anglican Church of Uganda. His people lived in the Teso northeastern part of the country and belonged to the Atesot tribe, of the clan of Aatekok or Iraraka. His father, Samusan Okadakina, of the village of Tilling in Ngora County, volunteered in 1920 to take Christianity to Soroti County where he became a catechist in the church, and where, in 1921, he married, according to church ritual, Eseza Iyamitai, who gave birth on 24 June 1926, in r4< ¾ 

A —  Enoch Olinga           

  the village of Abaango, to her second son, Enoch. 

 In 1927 Enoch's father returned to his permanent home in Tilling — a name which will forever be associated not only with Africa's oniy native Hand of the Cause, but with the first substantial conversion of the African people to the Faith of Baha'u'llah, an event which was a source of immense joy and pride to the heart of the beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi. 

 Enoch's stature must be seen against a unique period in Baha'i history, for he accepted  this new Faith of God shortly after its introduction into black Africa through a vast planned drive to carry Baha'u'llah's message to its people. During the last thirty years of Baha'u'llah's ministTy a few of His followers Living in Egypt and the Sudan were the recipients of His praise and encouragement; during 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry the Faith bad reached Tunis, and for the first time some of its occidental supporters, greatly encouraged by the Master, were spreading its message in southern Africa; it remained, however, for the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, at the time of the British National 

Spiritual Assembly's

  year interim plan in 1950 — 1952, to truly inaugurate the spiritual conquest of Africa through the strong support and guidance he gave to Persian, British and American believers to pioneer there. This initial step he followed up on a grand scale through the provisions of his World Crusade, inaugurated in 1953 — a Ten Year Plan which, among other objectives,was to open to the Faith 131 virgin territories in the five continents of the globe; many of its objectives concerned the work in Africa, whose pioneers were responsible for the phenomenally rapid spread of the Teachings amongst a race whom Baha'u'llah Himself  had compared to 'the black pupil of the eye' through which 'the light of the spirit shineth forth' — a statement fraught with profound  implications, for the sight of the eye is in the pupil. 

 The current of Enoch Olinga's destiny carried him towards a fixed point; for the ten years after his father returned to Tilling in 1927, Enoch received his schooling locally and at Ngora, a small town not far from his home; later he went to high school in 

Mbale; during World War    

 IL, in 1941, he joined the British Army Education Corps and went to Nairobi in Kenya, later serving in the East African King's 

Rifles Corps in South      
East Asia, visiting Burma, 

East Pakistan, Ceylon      

 and India. By 1946 he had returned to Uganda, a young man of twenty, and joined the Government 

Department of Public       
Relations and Welfare.     

 For a time he was stationed in Soroti and Mbale, producing two books in his own language, Ateso, which were of assistance  to the Government 

Education Department      

 in the Teso district; later he moved to Kampala, the capital of Uganda. 

 By the time Enoch came in contact with the Faith in 1951 his personal life had assumed an entirely new aspect; he was now married and had his first children; he was a gifted translator  working for the government, but also a somewhat disillusioned man who bad become a very heavy drinker, a fact of which the government service that employed him had become aware and which led to his dismissal, in spite of his marked capacity and relatively long record of service. Unfortunately the reports on this serious impairment to the discharge of his duties had already gone through when Enoch accepted the Faith and upon his enrolment gave up all alcohol immediately. 

 Enoch was the third Ugandan to accept Baha'u'llah, but the first of the Teso tribe; he heard about the Faith from a friend who introduced him to 'Au Na}~jav~ni, the son-in-Law of Mr. and Mrs. Bantni who had left Persia to pioneer, in response to the wishes of Shoghi Effendi, had proceeded to Africa and settled in Uganda with their daughter Violette, her husband 'Au, and theft daughter, aged three, arriving there in 1951; Mr. Ban6ni purchased a home in the heart of 

Kampala, at 3 Kitante      

 Road; events were to take place there, of both joy and grief, which are inextricably interwoven with the unfoldment of 

'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine      
Plan in that continent.   

 Once Enoch had met 'Au a friendship began to unfold and Enoch attended the regular evening meetings held for enquirers in the Ban6ni home, where the warmth of this Persian Baha'i household greatly attracted him. In February 1952 Mr. and Mrs. Ban&ni left on their pilgrimage to the World Centre, and it was agreed that during this time the pioneers in Kampala would hold a special meeting for all the Africans who were interested  in the Faith and that this would coincide with the time in Haifa when the Guardian usually visited the Shrines; Mr. Baha'i would inform him of this and ask for special prayers. Shoghi Effendi was happy to comply with this request, and he and Mr. Ban~ni visited the Shrines together at that hour. Enoch attended that meeting in Kampala — but nothing happened!  The three pioneers — the Na~jj avThis and Philip Hainsworth — felt very discouraged. Later that night, however, he returned, posed many questions and ended up by asking 'How does one become a Ba1A'fl' Early the following  morning he appeared with a letter requesting  to be accepted as a believer; from the very beginning Enoch had avidly read every Baha'i book he could get, and this Laid the foundation  for his deep knowledge of the Teachings.  Mrs. Olinga, making no secret of the fact that it was the remarkable transformation in her husband's conduct since he had become a Baha'i that influenced her decision, also embraced the Faith. 

 Gradually others swelled its numbers in Kampala so that by 21 April 1952, the first, historic Local 

Spiritual Assem


<p620>
620                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  bly of Uganda, of which Enoch was a member,  could be elected in that city. 

 Some months later Enoch returned to his Teso home in Tilling to spread the glad tidings of Baha'u'llah's teachings and aroused such interest that he returned to Kampala and persuaded 'Ali to visit Tilling, as the people there wanted to see with their own eyes the white man who had converted Enoch to this new doctrine. 'All, first with Enoch as interpreter, later with Enos Epyeru, one of the first Teso believers, travelled and taught in the Teso district for several weeks, where regular enrolment now began, one of the first being Enoch's own father, who became a very staunch Baha'i. 

 In the beginning of January 1953 — eight months after the Local Assembly of Kampala was formed — the Guardian cabled the Baha world: 

SHARE BAHA COMMUNiTIES   
EAST WEST THRILLING REPORTS
FEATS ACHIEVED HEROIC BAND
PIONEERS LABOURING DIVERS 
WIDELY SCATTERED AFRICAN  
TERRITORIES PARTICULARLY 

 UGANDA, and went on to liken these feats to episodes related in the Book of Acts in the Bible and to the rapid and dramatic propagation of our own Faith by the Dawn-Breakers  of its Heroic Age. He stated that what was happening in Africa eclipsed even the marvellous accomplishments in Latin America and surpassed the exploits which immortalized the European Crusade. 

 Shoghi Effendi attached great importance to the identity of people; the believers were never an amorphous  mass who accepted Baha'u'llah; they were individuals, interesting, like the coloured pieces that make up a beautiful mosaic picture. It was at this moment that the spotlight went to Uganda and was held there till the end of Shoghi Effendi's life. 

 In that same cable he went on to say: NUMBER AFRICANS 

CONVERTED CAUSE LAST FIFTEEN
MONTHS RESIDING KAMPALA OUTLYING
DISTRICTS PROTESTANT      
CATHOLIC PAGAN BACKGROUNDS
LErrERED UNLETTERED BOTH  
SEXES REPRESENTATIVE      
NO LESS SIXTEEN TRIBES    
PASSED TWO HUNDRED. This  

 was the first blast on the trumpet of 'entry by troops' predicted and so much hoped for by 'Abdu'l-Baha.  In that same cable the Guardian announced that no less than nine localities would be qualified in RiQvTh to form their Local Assemblies; still more significant, however, was his announcement that he would send to the first of the four Intercontinental Conferences to be held in 1953 — which was the African one held in Kampala — a copy of the portrait of the BTh, the showing of which he w~s confident would bring the new African believers 

CLOSER SPIRIT MARTYR-PROPHET

BENEDICTION ALL GATHERED  
MEMORABLE SESSIONS EPOCHMAKING 

 CONFERENCE. It was Enoch, the new Baha'i, who found himself on the Kampala Local Assembly, caught up with veteran believers in making plans for this unique and historic gathering. 

 When Enoch had been disheartened over losing his job, Mr. BanAni, in a flight of prophecy, had rallied his spirit, assuring him he would get an even better job — which he later did. The Conference was to be held from February 12th to 18th and the Guardian himself had placed a sum of money in charge of Mr. Ban~ni to be used exclusively to bring some of the new Baha'is as his guests. As the 'mass conversion' was taking place in Teso, this meant that about 200 people would be brought down by bus from this northeastern province, which was a trip of over 200 miles. 

 'Au NaThjav~nf went to escort the friends and invite them to be Shoghi 

Effendi's guests. When    

 the men got on the buses many of the women wept and wailed because they were afraid their men were being taken off to be slaves! 

 In his greeting and message to this 'epochmaking' Conference, which the Guardian hailed with a 'joyous heart', he said 'welcome with open arms the unexpectedly large number  of the representatives of the pure-hearted and the spiritually receptive Negro race' and pointed out that their continent had retained its primitive simplicity and 'remained uncontaminated'  by what he characterized in scathing terms as the evils of 'a gross, a rampant and cancerous materialism undermining the fabric of human society alike in the East and in the West' and 'threatening to engulf in one common catastrophic convulsion the generality of mankind'. 

 Weighty words containing a weightier warning. In this message Shoghi Effendi outlines the vast amount of work lying ahead for the six sponsoring National Assemblies,  the indigenous believers themselves, and their pioneer helpers. 

 No less than thirty-three virgin territories are to be opened to the Faith and three giant National — really


<p621>
IN MEMORIAM               621

  regional in nature — Assemblies are to be formed, embracing the continent: Central and East Africa with its seat in Kampala, South and West Africa with its seat in Johannesburg, and NorthWest Africa with its seat in Tunis. Amongst other additional objectives, the Hand of the Cause for Africa, Mr. Ban6ni, is to nominate during the following Ridvan, 

1954, an Auxiliary Board   

 of nine members to assist in the tasks that lie ahead. 

 Every one of these points touches on Enoch's own life: it was his people, the Tesos, numbering many tens of thousands, who formed the vast majority of Baha'is in Uganda before the civil war; he responded to the appeal for pioneers to open the thirty-three territories and himself became a Knight of Baha'u'llah; he was elected to the first National Spiritual 

Assembly of NorthWest Africa;

 he was appointed a Hand of the Cause in the last contingent of eight elevated to that rank by Shoghi Effendi just before he passed away. Enoch thus became the colleague of M6sA BanAni, in whose home he had accepted the Faith. There can be no doubt, as we look back on his life as a Baha'i, that the experience  of Enoch, when he saw the portrait of the Martyr-Prophet of his Faith, did indeed bestow an 'everlasting benediction' upon him. 

 Enoch was now established in his new job and his reformed way of life — but a strong wind was blowing, the wind of God calling the souls of the receptive Baha'is to arise and hear the call of their Lord and carry His Message to far places. As Enoch's father had once arisen to carry the Christian Faith to another territory, so now Enoch and two other new Ugandan be1i~vers arose to leave family, home, job and country to carry the glad tidings of Baha'u'llah across the continent to West Africa, to some of those waiting, unopened countries. Mr. BanAnf, the Spiritual Conqueror of Africa, as Shoghi Effendi called him, had recently bought a small Peugeot station-wagon which he placed at their disposal.  Originally the trip had been planned to take Violette to visit a Baha family in the Congo, but now its character entirely changed when the ever-faithful and ever-enthusiastic 'All volunteered to drive the three wouldbe pioneers across the continent in his capacity of spiritual pilot and physical chauffeur. 

 The five set off, on 27 August 1953, with not too much money and almost no information about the route that lay ahead, on probably the most abominable roads in the world, in a passenger car certainly not equipped to cope with them. Their consolation then, and throughout the entire journey, was a cable received from their beloved Guardian on the eve of their departure: LOVING, 

FERVENT PRAYERS ACCOMPANYING 
YOU.                       

  About a week later Samson Mungono was dropped off in Kamina, in what was then the Belgian Congo (now Zaire), which already had two non-African believers living in different  parts of the country; by 26 September Max Kenyerezi, the Knight of Baha'u'llah for French Equatorial Africa (now Congo Repub-lie), had been established in Brazzaville. The longest and hardest part of the journey, however, still Lay ahead through the deep tropical jungles of Gabon: passing through a disease-decimated area, plagued by insects, constantly getting stuck in the mud, 'All or Enoch had to walk many miles to get help from villagers to lift their car out of the bog; so difficult was the road that in one day, during sixteen hours, they progressed only 100 kilometres. On the next day they made only 25 kilometres in fourteen hours; finally the car really broke down; Enoch volunteered to walk ahead 50 miles, with a villager as a guide, to get help from a town that reputedly had a garage; separating from Enoch distressed the NakhjavThis even more than their own plight; 'All — no mechanic — at last succeeded in repairing the car's clutch sufficiently to limp along on Enoch's trail, constantly breaking down, but eventually managing to overtake him the following day after Enoch had walked 35 miles; he was exhausted from bad dysentery,  in pain and very worried over them; on reaching the town 'All, who had been badly bitten by tsetse flies — the dread carrier of sleeping sickness — and Violette, who had also been bitten by them, went to the hospital for tests and treatment, but Enoch was so ill he was hospitalized for two days and could not travel for a week. 

 When they had overtaken Enoch he told them that the night before, when he was alone with only strange Africans around him with whom he could not talk, afraid for his safety and the money he was carrying, full of misgivings and doubt, asking himself why he had left home and family on


<p622>
622                 TIlE BAHA'I WORLD

  such a mad undertaking, he dreamed of Shoghi Effendi, who took him in his arms and held him close, and into him had poured comfort and reassurance; this dream restored his strength and affected him so profoundly he cried out in his heart to the Guardian that he was willing to go through such hardships for him every day of his life! 

 Finally, on 10 October, the little party crossed into French Cameroons, but Enoch's objective was British Cameroons, a goal which he was to fill on behalf of the 

British National Spiritual 

 Assembly. The main bridge between the two countries was down; by a long and agonizing detour the party at last drove into Mamfe — rushing for the post office there to cable the Guardian that British Cameroons was now opened by Enoch's arrival. 

 It was 4 p.m. and ithe postmaster was closing up, but 'Au begged him to reopen so that this important cable could get off before the Hoiy Year ended on that very night of 15 October. On the 16th they arrived in Victoria, on the coast, where Enoch was to live for the coming ten years before returning permanently to his homeland in East 

Africa.                    

 The Africa of those days was still under colonial administration; reluctantly the Nakh-jav6nfs  and Enoch agreed that their association might place in jeopardy the object of so much effort and sacrifice because Victoria was oniy a small town and two white orientals and a black Ugandan were far too conspicuous a combination. 

 The first problem was where to find lodging for Enoch; tribalism, even today, makes one group very suspicious of any other; no one wanted to take in a man from another people 3,000 kilometres away, the other side of Africa. Finally, thrnugh the familiar odd series of circumstances which seem so often to open doors for Baha'i pioneers, a young man working in the local library got into conversation  with Violette, found she was worrying over how to find accommodation for a 'young Ugandan we know', and asked to meet Enoch. The upshot was Enoch became a lodger in the home of David Tanyi, who not only accepted the Faith through him, becoming the first believer in the entire Cameroons., 

 but later became the Knight of Baha'u'llah for French Togoland. 

 The Naj~jav~infs removed to nearby  Douala, in the French Cameroons, where they could still be close to Enoch without arousing the suspicions of the local authorities in Victoria because they wanted to be sure he would get his residence visa and was safely settled in his pioneering post before they returned to Uganda. Enoch himself discreetly but eagerly began to teach new friends. 

 The period of the Guardian's World Crusade  was indeed a time of flame. A holy enthusiasm to teach the Cause of God to humanity spread far and wide. Shoghi Effendi,  greatly encouraged by the remarkable trek across Africa which had already led to the opening of two new countries, now encouraged Enoch to do the seemingly impossible and raise up, from among his new converts, pioneers to go forth and open other virgin territories. 

 When one realizes that Enoch himself was a new Baha'i and a recent pioneer, his success was almost miraculous. In a Ltter addressed to Leroy Loas dated 15 April 1954 — exactly six months after his arrival  in the British Cameroons — Enoch wrote: 'Praised be to God that our Beloved Guardian's admonition to assign and get pioneers settled in the five virgin territories has through Beloved's Boundless Grace been fulfilled. We prayerfully raise up our suppliant hands and voices of praise to Baha'u'llah for His guidance  and confirmations, and I believe very firmly that He will assuredly assist and guide these new and young soldiers in His triumphant  Army, and render them victorious for, according to my little understanding and belief, they have in them such a rare spirit of love and devotion to His Best 

Beloved Cause.'            

 At first, he wrote, it looked almost impossible to get any of the new believers to leave their homes and move to foreign lands: •hut I knew very well that the Beloved Guardian, who is actually watching the world and all the believers, could not have asked for the impossible. 

 As soon as the news reached their attentive and sensitive ears the believers reacted in such a manner that a spectator could take them for drunkards. they really became intoxicated with the choice wine of His love and of submissiveness and obedience to the call of their Best Beloved. 

 Pioneering offers poured in like locusts and clear signs of obedience to move the next minute were made manifest, forgetting their property and loving relatives and families.' 
Indeed, so many


<p623>
IN MEMORIAM                623

  offers to pioneer were made that in the end they had to draw lots to see which five would be chosen to go. 'All flew back to Victoria to help make the arrangements for visas and transportation — in those days a much more complicated matter than today in independent Africa. 

 'When 'AU arrived', Enoch wrote, 'not a single moment was wasted. Off they flew like very mighty eagles in the heavenly sky. Such are the soldiers of Baha'u'llah. 

 0! How I wish I accompanied them! May Baha'u'llah sustain them and guide their footsteps along the glorious path of spiritual understanding and selfless sacrifice so that they may grow into trees whose fruits will be the food for the hungry ones. My constant prayer is that they may find means of settlement. 

 I know the Beloved Guardian's fervent prayers are with them.' 

 Enoch also reports that the letter of Shoghi Effendi to David Tanyl, received on the eve of his departure to pioneer, was indeed a remarkable coincidence and that David had said he was going to frame it. At the airport, while relatives dissolved in tears, the pioneers cheerfully marched to the plane, a contrast which to Enoch crowned 'the pioneering of these gallant and stalwart soldiers of the Ancient Beauty'. 

 In answer to his letter Enoch was assured that the Guardian 'was deeply moved by the reports which you sent and the manner in which the friends received his call to pioneer in the virgin areas. He feels this is truly historic, because it means that people who have been Baha'is for oniy a short period, have arisen to carry the Glad Tidings to peoples of new lands. The manner in which the Faith has spread in Africa is truly remarkable,  and overshadows the manner it has spread in other parts of the world. 

 It indicates how glorious will be the future of the Faith in that great continent.' 

 The names of these precious and distinguished  spiritual children of Enoch, who received each the title, like himself, of Knight of Baha'u'llah, are as follows: 

David Tanyi, French Togoland;
Edward Tabe, British Togoland;
Samuel Njiki, French      
Cameroons Benedict Eballa,

Ashanti Protectorate;     
Martin  Manga, Northern  
Territories Protectorate. 
   Two months later, on      

14 June 1954, Enoch       

 wrote his first letter to Shoghi Effendi; as far as records go it seems this was his only one, hence I will quote it in full as it well reflects his love, his respect, his obedience to the Head of his Faith and the one who had become the focal point of his life: 

     My Well-Beloved Guardian  
 I must first thank my     

Well-Beloved Guardian     

 for continually praying for my spiritual welfare as well as of those who are now serving the Ancient Beauty, and for the Beloved Guardian's guidance, without which the present spiritual achievements of our beloved Faith would have not been possible. 

 Furthermore, I very humbly beg to assure my dearly loved Guardian of my unreserved loving devotion to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, and my submissiveness to every one of the Guardian's admonitions in the way of promoting the fundamental interests of our Faith, which is now overshadowing the entire world. May I also be permitted to express the joy and delight which the letters received by the individual Baha'is from the Beloved Guardian have brought to the hearts of all the believers of this nascent community. 

 These letters, like the fervent prayers of the Beloved Guardian, do wonders here. Our daily prayer and hope is that God, the All-Compelling, the All-Protecting may prolong  the days of our Beloved Guardian's unbroken service to His Cause and mankind. 

 As my Beloved Guardian    

 may be aware, an Assembly was elected here last Ridvan, and through Beloved's Grace the coming Ridvan may bring us a number of local Assemblies. 

 I have just returned from a two weeks' teaching trip which took me right inside the country where I had quite thrilling and exciting experiences; especially when I had to live among the villagers who believe in witchcraft and potency of 'Juju' (fetish, I think) practices. 

 Quite terrifying it was to hear very frightful stories told by 'Juju' adherents, but with much confidence in Baha'u'llah I was never deterred. 

 Fortunately  enough a few of them were enabled to see the Truth of the Message of Baha'u'llah  — may my life, soul and spirit be a


<p624>
624                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  sacrifice unto the lowliest of His servants! It may please my Beloved Guardian to know that ten new centres have been opened to the Faith, making a total of twelve centres in British Cameroons. We want to develop all the eleven towards Assembly status before the next Ridvan. We really need our Well-Beloved Guardian's special prayers for success in this somewhat ambitious project. 

 We receive very encouraging letters from all our five pioneers who have gone to open virgin territories. 

 They all seem very happy there and are waiting for the doors of success to be opened for them. 

 We all hope and pray that in time they will find jobs they can do. This is not only because they will thereby be able to support themselves,  but also because they will feel so much more happy and settled when they have jobs of work to do. They will take root and feel they belong. We always encourage them to remain there as much as we can when we write to them. 

 My Well-Beloved Guardian   

 may be interested  to know that the number of believers is increasing very rapidly in British Cameroons. The present situation is: accepted believers, up to 30; declarations, up to 40; centres now opened to the Faith, ~2. 

 Please, my Beloved Guardian, I know how much busy you are, therefore I shall not dwell on inconsequentialities. 

 I very reverently beg to send my loving greetings and best wishes to my Beloved Guardian and all members of family. 

 With warmest Baha Love    

 from Victoria believers, I beg to remain, my Beloved Guardian, Your devoted servant, 

 Enoch Olinga               

  It was not the custom of the Guardian to keep copies of his wide correspondence; we do know, however, that this letter was answered by him on 9 August but, unfortunately,  the original has not been found. 

 In those days the Baha'is throughout Africa were few and far between but part of the great Ten Yeai 

Plan of Shoghi Effendi     
was to create not only     

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 but bodies to fulfil the functions of National Spiritual Assemblies; he solved the problem of too few believers in any one country to justify an independent National Assembly by constituting,  in 1956, a number of giant administrative units so that the Baha'is could learn to think and function in an administrative manner. 

 The biggest group — united under the umbrella of the National Spiritual Assembly of NorthWest Africa, with its secretarial seat in Tunis, Tunisia — comprised no less than 25 territories, namely, Algeria, Ashanti 

Protectorate,  British    

 Cameroons, British Togoland, Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands, 

French Cameroons, French   

 Morocco, French logo-land, French West Africa, the Gambia, Gold Coast, Liberia, 

Madeira, Morocco (Inter-national 

 Zone), Nigeria, Northern Territories Protectorate, 

Portuguese Guinea, Rio     

 de Oro, St. Thomas Island, Sierra Leone, Spanish Guinea, 

Spanish Morocco, Spanish   
Sahara and Tunisia. In     

 spite of this impressive list there were only about 1,000 Baha in this vast area and the National Body rested on 38 Local Assemblies; thanks to Shoghi Effendi, however, Tunis had its own National Baha'i Headquarters, and Bomi Hills, in Liberia, was the proud possessor of the only endowment; Enoch Olinga was elected chairman of this new Body. It seems unbelievalMe that in the brief space of three years, of the thirty-three virgin territories throughout Africa to be opened to the Faith, twenty-nine had already received pioneers. 

 In the heart of Enoch burned the great desire to make the pilgrimage to the World Centre and meet his b&loved Guardian in person. 

 Permission was finally asked and granted by Shoghi Effendi who, as was his custom, set a date by week, in other words Enoch was informed he would be welcome as a pilgrim in the first week of February 1957. Dr. Ugo Giachery, Hand of the Cause and member-at-large of the International Baha'i Council in Haifa, was residing in Rome; he has given us this endearing image of 

Enoch:                     

 he arrived from Tunis the morning of 1 February 1957, 'he was young, lean, lovable at first sight and believing that this Hand of the Cause could perform miracles. He had an old English passport that had expired some years before, and practically not a penny (of any currency) in his pocket. I took him to the


<p625>
IN MEMORIAM                625

British Consulate. The    

 wax-moustached Consul, for a solid twenty minutes, denied the possibility to renew the passport. 

 I had told Enoch not to say anything but recite the Remover of Difficulties When I said that Mr. Olinga had been called by the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, to Haifa, the Consul opened a drawer of his desk, took a voluminous dossier with blue pages, leafed them with great attention and then said: "I think I can do it." With the valid passport in hand we rushed to the Israeli Embassy for the visa, which was granted immediately. Then I thought that Enoch could be hungry and asked him if he was. 

 "Yes", he said; he had not eaten from the night before Dear, dear Enoch, he had stolen our hearts!' 

 Enoch, in his wide travels all over the world, often had recourse to the 'Remover of Difficulties'. I remember once his telling me that at the end of a long trip, as he went to embark for Uganda, the air company employee who was weighing him in said he was overweight and must pay so and so much excess baggage; Enoch said he was on his way home after a long trip and just did not have the money; she said he must either pay or leave his Luggage behind. Whereupon, standing  there in the airline queue, he drew out his prayer book and began to read a prayer to himself. The girl said, 'What are you doing!' Enoch said: '1 am praying, what else can I do?' She was so nonplussed by this she waved him and his baggage on with no extra payment. 

 On 3 February Enoch arrived in Haifa and left on the 13th; he stayed in the 

Oriental Pilgrim House    

 near the Shrines on Mount Carmel, which meant Shoghi Effendi was going to treat him as an oriental pilgrim; the men who stayed there had the privilege of not only taking walks in the gardens with the Guardian but the great blessing of always visiting the Shrines with him and hearing him chant the 

Tablets of Visitation     

 in his wonderfully  melodious voice; to add to this privilege Enoch was most of the time alone; naturally Shoghi Effendi spoke to him in English. Sometimes Enoch would recall his first impressions,  how anxiously he waited to be called to the presence of his Guardian, how he could not imagine what Shoghi Effendi would be like or how he would look but then discovered with what majesty he spoke and that when he saw him walking 'he walked like a king' and one knew it was his to command, that he held the authority. Enoch told his children Shoghi Effendi was like a lion, but at the same time very gentle; he reported an experience common to a great many pilgrims, that he found before he had a chance to ask his questions, Shoghi Effendi had answered them. 

 Unlike most pilgrims, however, when the Guardian said goodbye to him he kissed him on both cheeks. 

 Few pilgrims, indeed, left the Holy Land without their visits to the Shrines and their meetings with the Guardian beginning to work a change in them; Enoch was no exception; the love showered upon him by Shoghi Effendi, the illuminating quality of his conversation, profoundly affected Enoch's whole life; whereas before he was a needle jumping about in the direction of north he now became like an adjusted compass oriented firmly to the Centre of his Faith, his Guardian, his true king. He went back to West Africa enkindled, reassured, more mature. 

 Excerpts from two of Enoch's Letters to me, written in 1956 and 1957, vividly reflect the depths of his attachment to Shoghi Effendi: 'Please, will you remember me to the beloved Guardian and tell him how much we all love him'; 'Having visited and prayed in the Blessed Shrines, gazed on the holy face of our Guardian and heard his melodious voice, I am sure a new day has dawned upon me!' 

 A letter written on 15 February 1957, on behalf of the Guardian to MiisA Ban~nf, expressed 'his pleasure with the visit on his pilgrimage of the first African Baha'i of the Ten Year Crusade — in fact, the first Negro Baha'i from Africa. Enoch Olinga has achieved many victories for the Faith; first in his work in Uganda; then by pioneering in the British Cameroons, becoming a Knight of 

Baha'u'llah  there. Five 

 of his spiritual children went from the Cameroons, to virgin areas of the Ten Year Crusade, thus becoming themselves,  Knights of Baha'u'llah. He himself has confirmed 300 souls, with five Assemblies. The Guardian considers this unique in the history of the Crusade, in both the East and West; and he has blessed the one who so selflessly served, and won these victories for

 the Cause of God, by naming him "Abu'1-Futiih",  the 

"Father of Victories".     

 The Guardian felt you and Au would be pleased to know this, as he was AU's spiritual child, For various reasons, economic and otherwise,  Enoch's wife and children had remained in East Africa; now, however, with his elec-lion  to the NorthWest 

African National Spiritual 

 Assembly and his ever-incteasing teaching activities, it seemed he was permanently  settled in West Africa, and shortly after his return from pilgrimage he went back to Uganda to fetch them. It was on 2 October 1957, at the time of this visit, that Mr. Ban~iini received a cable from Shoghi Effendi requesting  him to inform Enoch Olinga, as well as two pioneers serving in Africa — John Robarts and William Sears — of their ELEVATION RANK HAND CAUSE, adding FEEL CONEIDIENT 

HIGH LUS-TINCTION  WJLL    
ENABLE THEM ENRICH RECORD THEIR
MERITORIOUS SERVICES.      

 Enoch was summoned  to that same home where he had accepted the Faith and the Guardian's cable placed in his hands; he read it and then prostrated himself flat on the floor, a mark in Africa of deep submis~ion to one's Liege. 

 It must be remembered that for Enoch and the seven other Hands of the Cause appointed by Shoghi Effendi at the same time, his death, one month later, coming as it did so swiftly upon the already stunning news of being raised to the rank of a Hand, was a tremendous  shock; before they could do more than acknowledge this new station conferred upon them, their guide and 'true brother' was gone! Enoch cabled Shoghi

  Returning to live in Victoria with his family, Enoch's teaching activities throughout West Africa continued on an ever-wider scale; all the British territories in that region were controlled and administered from Nigeria and many new converts were brought into the Faith by him in that country, which he frequently visited, as well as in the Cameroons. 

 His oldest son, George, recalls that during those West African years his father was often absent on very long teaching trips outside the country; Enoch himself mentions Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia  'to mention', he says, 'but a few', where he was 'instrumental in guiding many souls to the Cause of God'. 

 The vivid stories he told his family when he returned stimulated the children's interest in the Faith; sometimes, if he was only on a weekend trip in the Cameroons, he took George with him. Not only was his service to the Faith a special thing for Enoch but in his borne there was always a special place for his treasured photographs of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 and Shoghi Effendi and places with sacred associations. 

 All this implanted in the hearts of his children a similar love and respect; all of them grew to be staunch Baha'is. 

 Although the formalities required to attend the beloved Guardian's funeral in London prevented Enoch from being present, he was able to join his fellow Hands at their first Conclave held immediately after Shoghi 1317-fendi's  passing, in Baha, on 18 November 1957, and to be present at all the others. In spite of the fact that Enoch had the gift of words and was a brilliant public speaker, he was remarkably silent, I remember, during our meetings, following carefully the long hours and days of discussion in two languages, English and Persian, keeping his own counsel deep in his heart, making up his own mind. When one remembers he was a new Baha'i of only four years' experience, that he was a young man only thirty-one years old — our baby Hand — one must realize that these were years of great stress for him; they were terrible years of stress for his much older peers, many of whom were born Baha'is! 

 One of Enoch's most endearing qualities was his laugh, a great, joyous, consuming and contagious laugh. 

 His fellow Hands were not slow to appreciate this and went so far as to save up funny stories the whole year so they could tell them to Enoch at the next Conclave; God knows our hearts and minds were weighted down enough with our responsibilities  and problems so the laughter at our dining table was a welcome relief for often sad and exhausted minds, but sometimes they made Enoch laugh so much that I scolded them, saying they would make him ill; of course others laughed too — but not like Enoch,


<p627>

  who would begin by chuckling and end up convulsed. 

 Ever since his pilgrimage Enoch and I had become very close; some of the Hands slept in Baha while others returned for the night to Haifa; Enoch and I were among those who always  remained in Baha during the entire Conclave; I remember once, when we had a regular plague of snails devouring the gardens, I insisted that the Hands come out and pick snails, giving them buckets and bowls to put them in: in the bright moonlight about eight of us started down the borders in front of the Shrine; eventually when I turned around I found everyone had sneaked off, only faithful Enoch and I were still gathering snails! 

 Those years from 1957 until 1963 — when Enoch returned to live in East Africa — were in many ways very difficult for him; his relations, with Eunice, his first wife, were going from bad to worse; finally, after about three years, she returned to East Africa, but the children remained with him; a divorce was obtained in 1961 and in 1963 Enoch went to Nairobi with his second wife, Elizabeth, by whom he had two children, 

Lennie and Tahirih.        

 While still resident in West Africa Enoch returned to Kampala to attend the historic occasion of the laying of the foundation stone of the Mother Temple of Africa on 14 January 1958; he took part in the African Teaching Conference held concurrently with that event, he and I sharing the platform of the public meeting; a week later the impressive 

Baha'i African Intercontinental

 Conference, called by the Guardian, was held in Kampala — one of five similar conferences marking the midway  point of his World Crusade; Enoch was chairman of one of its sessions and speaker at another, his theme: 'The Vital 

Process of Individual Conversion.'

 All these events and pressures on Enoch's life were — as should be the case for each of us — shaping his character, helping him to grow spiritually into his own potentialities, maturing him into a truly great man, but not without suffering, anxiety and descending into valleys as well as scaling mountains. In a letter to me on 13 October 1963 Enoch wrote from Nigeria: 'I am now on my way to Nairobi where I intend to make my home', and where he says he will have 'to overcome many difficulties which are bound to come my way; he asks for prayers for his 'weak, frail and helpless self the pain I experience these days is big pray for me that I may rise above the present mental and soul-destroying condition in which I sadly find myself. 

 He always supplicated his beloved Blessed Perfection, 'I know He will help me to disintegrate the wall which surrounds my entire being and which I am struggling to break.' Dark years of upheaval for Enoch. 

 He finally returned to live in his native village of Tilling in Teso, Uganda, and build a house there for his family. Gradually, through the loving guidance of the Universal House of Justice, he once again began to travel widely for the Faith. Like other Hands of the Cause, he often represented the House of Justice at International Conferences and inaugural Conventions  of new National Spiritual Assemblies all over the world. His travels to these, as well as many long tours undertaken in all the continents of the globe, were a source of happiness to both Enoch and the thousands of believers who met him; he grew steadily into his maturity. He was a very intelligent man, a very eloquent, self-possessed speaker; he was both dignified and urbane in his handling of officials and the media. 

 Enoch had presence; it is hard to describe because there was something very African about it, the 'presence' of a big chief, who is both a father-figure and rules. He was sincerely kind, loving and interested in other people and they felt this —  high and low alike — and responded. That big, spontaneous laugh was also there, to carry others on with it in a great relaxing wave of sheer mirth. 

 The Hands of the Faith chose Enoch to be chairman of the opening session of the beloved  Guardian's Baha World Congress, held from 28 April to 2 May 1963, commemorating  the end of his great Ten Year Plan, his World Crusade. About 7,000 Baha'is were present, from most of the territories and major islands of the world, gathered in the beAutiful 

Albert Hall of London.     

 The big, black Enoch was a befitting Iigure to stand before such a motley crowd on such an historic occasion! 

 Enoch met many heads of state as he visited different countries; one of the most interesting  interviews he ever had was with the 

Dalal


<p628>
628                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Lama in October 1968, in his retreat at Dharamsala in India; the party were first thoroughly searched by the Lama's security people, and after some delays, received by His Holiness, the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people and to them the reincarnation of Buddha. He was surprised and interested to see these guests who included a black African his wife and daughter, an Englishman and two Indians. Although he spoke through a translator, it was evident that he understood English; he commented that they were all different people, to which Enoch replied, 'Yes, but we are all of the same family', and went on to elaborate this theme and also to give an account of Baha'u'llah's exiles, imprisonment and sufferings, which struck a deep chord of sympathy in his host. 

 Their visit lasted over an hour — which was unusual — and His Holiness showed them excessive courtesy; there was no doubt of the impression Enoch had made on him as he set forth many of Baha'u'llah's teachings. 

 The common sense and wisdom of Enoch are nowhere better exemplified than in the conversations his Persian daughter-in-law Forough Ehsani, a pioneer in Uganda, has recorded having with her much-loved father-in-law in connection with her marriage to his son George. 

 In Tilling Enoch had a special office of his own, his 'prayer room', in which were his pictures of the Master and the Guardian and things that were dear to him; there he often spoke with her. 

 It was in this room one day that he asked her if she was sure she wanted to marry George: '"Do you like to marry him? 
marriage is not so easy.   
You have to be careful.    

 Have you thought of the future and how the difficulties will be? You are different, from different homes and country, do you in your heart accept that? 
Do you really like that?"  

 Many times he asked and I said, "Yes, I do." 

 So he hugged and kissed me and said, "The rest is with Baha'u'llah, He will solve the problems."' A day came when a crisis arose; after her child was born, during the first year of her marriage, a serious misunderstanding between her and a member of the family took place; she was so distressed she took up the child and left the house. 'Enoch', she said, 'sent one of his sons after me with this message: "Tell Forough to come and leave the child in this house, and whenever she wants to go, she can go."' When she confronted Enoch she said: 'But this child is mine!' ISnoch replied, 'No, this child belongs to this family; if you have a misunderstanding you solve it with the members of the family. 

 You cannot mix up the child with your problem and somebody else's problem. 

 Leave the child and then we can solve it all together. Don'tmix up the child with this problem.' She remembers that: 'When he said that I felt my knees shaking! 

 I put the child down and said, "But how can I go without my first child?", and then he told me, "When your anger has dropped, you come to my office. I want to see you, not with George, you only."' George remained quiet throughout, praying inwardly that all would resolve itself. She went to Enoch's office, in what must have been a terrible upheaval for all of them; he reminded her how, before her marriage, he had warned her there would be problems; earnestly, looking into her eyes he said: 'Forough my dear, your behaving as you did, taking the child out and not solving the problem, does not help you, does not help me, and especially does not help the Faith. You know that whatever you are doing from today should help the Faith, the name of the Faith. 

 And you know the slightest problem between you and George, how it can damage the Faith. Will you please think this way and forget the rest!' Forough recalls: 'He completely changed me. He said a prayer, he hugged me, and he cried. 

 He cried and I felt the wetness of his crying, and he said, "Please, please help the Faith!"' She rejoined the family, was completely reconciled, and from then on harmony prevailed. Enoch had impressed on her the greatest lesson of all — the Faith comes first. 

 There followed many years of active service; Enoch, often accompanied by his wife Elizabeth  — herself a devoted and active believer —  travelled widdy, visiting and stimulating the Baha'is, meeting high officials, bringing the Faith before the public and the media. His children grew up, two daughters married Baha'i pioneers, George and Forough had two more children. Alihough the Olinga home was in Teso, after the death of Mr. BanAni, Enoch purchased the historic house in which the BanAni-NaljjjjavAni family had lived for so many years in Kampala, the home in


<p629>
IN MEMORIAM                629

  which he himself had accepted the Faith and learned of his elevation to the rank of Hand of the Cause. 

 To enumerate in detail his services and travels from 1958 until his death in 1979 is impossible; long and authoritative biographies are required to recount the exploits of the Hands of the Cause appointed by Shoghi Effendi; only a glance at Enoch's major activities during those years is included here. He attended three of the 1958 midway point of the World Crusade continental conferences called for by Shoghi Effendi, namely, that of Africa, held in Kampala; Europe, held in Frankfurt; and Asia, held in Singapore. After the latter he made a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa and Pakistan, it being the policy of the Hands to make as wide and economic use as possible of the visit of a fellow Hand to attend conferences or conventions by visiting, going and coming, as many centres as possible throughout the area. In 1960 Enoch visited many places in West and North Africa, Sicily and Italy; in 1961, after representing the Hands of the Cause at the inaugural Baha'i 

Conventions in Jamaica, Dominican

 Republic and Cuba, he toured the Greater Antilles and Central America for four months; in 1962 he travelled extensively in East Africa, the Sudan, Ethiopia and the Congo (now ZaYre); in 1964 he represented the Universal House of Justice at the inaugural  Conventions of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Indian Ocean, in Mauritius, and South 

Central Africa, in Rhodesia

 (now Zimbabwe); in 1967 he represented the Universal House of Justice at the inaugural Convention of the National Spiritual Assembly  of Swaziland, Lesotho and Mozambique; in 1968 Enoch attended the large Mediterranean  Baha Conference held in Palermo, Sicily, and — like most of his fellow Hands —  was present at the glorious celebration in Baha of the one hundredth anniversary of Baha'u'llah's arrival in 'Akka as a prisoner; also in 1968 when Enoch was received by the Dalai Lama at his headquarters in India he visited many Baha centres in that vast subcontinent;  in 1969 Enoch represented the Universal House of Justice at the election of the first 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Burundi and Rwanda; in 1970 he represented the 

Universal House of Justice

 at the formation of the first National 

Spiritual Assembly of Upper

 West Africa, making later that same year an extensive tour of South America, Central America and the Antilles, passing through the United States and visiting many centres there; he then proceeded to the Pacific where he visited the Solomon Islands and Japan, attending in January 1971, as representative of the Universal House of Justice, the South 

China Seas Oceanic Conference

 in Singapore, and later that same year fulfilling the same function at the inaugural Convention of the National Spiritual Assembly of Chad; in 1971 Enoch represented the 

Universal House of Justice

 at the first Convention of the National Spiritual Assembly of Iceland and afterwards exhaustively toured the Baha communities in Scandinavia, Britain and Italy, visiting 

Persia with Elizabeth     

 in July to pay his homage to the House of the BTh in Shir~z and other Baha historic sites. Enoch was becoming increasingly preoccupied with Africa as the problems of that continent steadily augmented: in 1973 — 1974 he went on a five-month teaching trip to twelve countries of West Africa; 1975 saw him back in that area to attend, as the representative of the Universal House of Justice, three inaugural Conventions during the Ridvan period — not an unheard of event as other Hands on occasion duplicated such efforts — for the election of the National Spiritual Assemblies of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and Upper West Africa; during this same year Enoch again toured twelve West African countries, assisting them to win their goals, and, returning  to Uganda, spent the remainder of that year as well as the opening monYhs of 1976 intensively working amongst the Baha'i communities  there. During the summer of that year Enoch also revisited eight countries of West Africa before representing the Universal House of Justice, in January 1977, at the International Teaching Conference held in Brazil and later attending a similar conference  in M6rida, Mexico, visiting some other countries in the western hemisphere, and returning from the New World to Africa in timeto represent the Universal House of Justice  at the inaugural Convention of the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Upper Volta.  

 Having revisited various neighbouring countries, Enoch returned to Uganda to devote the


<p630>
630                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  remaining two years of his life to protecting, comforting, stimulating and preserving the endangered Baha'i community of his native land, in the bitter throes of a terrible civil war, the aftermath of which eventually led to his own death. 

 News of the banning of the Faith in September 1977 — the official dissolution of all its administrative bodies and activities —  reached Enoch in Kampala; he is reported to have said: 'No! No one can ban the Faith of God For the Baha it was a shocking and heartbreaking experience, the more so because the first Temple of Africa stood on Kikaya Hill, on the outskirts of Kampala, and the Ugandan believers had always been a distinguished and thriving community. 

 Enoch drafted a letter to the President, which he and the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly  delivered to the President's office, calling his attention to the nature and status of the Faith and the respect it had always enjoyed in Uganda. This and other petitions had no effect whatsoever. 

 Enoch's deep study of the Teachings and wide experience made him an ideal shield for the Cause of God during that crucial period; realizing the hopelessn&ss of protest and petition, he set himself to do three things: to ensure that the believers obeyed the government  implicitly; to encourage them and keep alive their faith; to protect the Baha'i properties  and remove to a safe place its sacred and irreplaceable archive materials, which he stored in Tilling. 

 Immediately following the edict Enoch and Mr. Isimai, the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly, had closed the 

National Headquarters     

 at the Temple site, refusing even to sell Baha books. 

 There can be little doubt that this complete obedience to the government decree, conforming as it did with the explicit instructions of Baha'u'llah Himself that Baha'is must obey their governments,  was the best possible way of protecting the precious Temple, which was never confiscated,  occupied or damaged, but left in the custody of the 

Baha.                   

 Following upon the banning of the Faith, the Universal House of Justice made the Hand of the Cause and the two Counsellors, Oloro 

Epyeru and Kolonario      

 Oule, responsible  for the guidance and protection of the Ugandan community, a duty they discharged with great devotion until the Universal House of Justice was able to reestablish an administrative body in August 1979. 

 As the months went by Uganda sank ever deeper into bitter civil war, terrorism and chaos, in the tide of which Enoch and his family were eventually so tragically engulfed. It should be remembered that Enoch was not only a famous Baha'i — the first African Hand of the Cause and one of the oniy two Negro Hands, the other being Louis Gregory of the United States — but also a wellknown capable, prosperous business man, with relatives and friends in high positions. As a consequence of this prominence he was a target for subversive elements. His son George recalls his father's telling him, even before the war broke out, that he had discovered his name was on a list due for 'elimination in Teso. During those crucial times Enoch often said he would never leave Uganda, never run away. 

 In March 1979, when the war of liberation was gaining momentum day by day, he decided to motor from Tilling to Kampala, a distance of some 300 kilometres; his uncle came to remonstrate with him, pointing out the dangers, and urging him not to go, but Enoch was not dissuaded and said: 'What do I have to fear? Did the Mb run away? Did Baha'u'llah run away? Did 'Abdu'l-Baha run away?', and described how wonderful it was to die a true believer, that if the veil were lifted between this world and the next we would yearn to die. 

 On the way to Kampala he met with a terrible automobile accident when an army lorry struck his car, knocking it off the road into a gorge, where it rolled over and over; he was also robbed of a large sum of money. This occurred on the 25th; that night, as Enoch and his family prayed together in their Kampala home, he assured them that were it not for Baha'u'llah, he would most certainly have died from such an accident. 

 As if this were not enough shock for the family to bear, two days later Enoch's son Bach vanished without a trace; a week later, however, he returned unscathed; it seemed soldiers had hijacked him and his pickup for a job out of town, later releasing him. After Badi disappeared, as the situation in the city became increasingly dangerous, the Olingas went up to the Temple


<p631>
IN MEMORIAM                631

  property, about 10 kilometres away, a long and exhausting walk for Enoch, who was still in great pain after his accident. By 6 April he decided to send his youngest child, Tahirili, with her mother back to Tilling — which they were fortunate to reach alive as the train was strafed by bullets many times on the way. Miraculously Badi returned safely at this time and Enoch promptly sent him and his brother Patrick after them. He himself was too weak as a result of the accident to make the arduous trip back to Tilling. 

 Enoch now returned alone to his home on Kitante Road. By 10 April thousands of people were in flight from Kampala, which was being heavily bombarded; once again Enoch was persuaded to seek refuge on the Temple property and made his painful way there, on foot, struggling against the frightened crowds of people leaving the city. All that night a fierce artillery battle raged around Kikaya Hill; he spent the night praying and wondering what was happening to the House of Worship and if he would ever see the dawn. 

 The next day, however, the Temple still stood unscathed and the Longed-for news was broadcast that Amin's government had been defeated. Enoch and another believer hastened to the Mother Temple of Africa, opened all the nine doors and offered prayers of thanksgiving to Baha'u'llah. How appropriate, how mysterious, that dear Enoch, who had been present at the cornerstone-laying of the Temple in 1958, shouLd with his own hands throw open those doors! 

 The following day Enoch went to Kampala, anxious for the safety of his house, as both the soldiers and the local population were extensiv&Iy looting the city; he arrived to see it being stripped bare and narrowly escaped being shot as he was accused of being one of Amin's men — an accusation which fortunately he successfully refuted! There being nothing he could do, he returned to the Temple where his protection was essential during those wholly lawless days of transition. 

 Elizabeth and his children were eager to rejoin him, so he decided to restore and refurnish his home. 

 Although the ban on the Faith was not officially lifted for some months, the situation had entirely changed and the Universal House of Justice decided to appoint an interim administrative body to gradually reorganize Baha activities and take charge of Baha'i properties in preparation for the time when the National Spiritual Assembly could be reelected.  The first meeting of this Uganda Administrative Committee would take place on 25 — 26 August in the National Headquarters; the derelict state of this and other buildings at the Temple site distressed Enoch very much and with few to help him, he set about preparing the Hazfratu'L-Quds, cleaning it up, arranging the offices and files, even going so far as to himself assist in washing the floors. For Enoch service always meant doing what needed to be done. He was radiantly happy over this event; when the Committee members gathered, each was presented with the gift of a new prayer book, with passages marked to be read, for Enoch had a 'well-worked-out and soul-stirring devotional programme'; the group then proceeded to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar for the solemn inauguration of their historic function, and afterwards visited the grave of the Hand of the Cause M6sh Ban~ni, who is buried in its vicinity. 

 Enoch was invited to chair the first meeting and read the letter of the 

Universal House of Justice 

 appointing the Committee and outlining its functions; he then observed that they were now 'an arm of the Universal House of Justice stretched over Uganda' and called upon them at all limes to rely on the power of the Holy Spirit to assist them. 

 On the second day Enoch again was invited to act as chairman; he outlined their duties, stressing the crying needs of the Baha community throughout the country and the serious condition of the Temple property, which had perforce been neglected and suffered depredations — telephone connections, water supply, lawn mowers, office equipment, all required urgent attention. 

 Enoch's son George, recalling his father's last days, says he spent most of his time on Kikaya Hill; he was happy, the formation of the new Uganda Administrative Committee had lifted a great burden; after all the years of frustration and anxiety, at last the administrative  edifice of the Faith was again raised and he told some of the friends that this was such a relief, he was ready to die. He loved serving the Temple, cleaning and sweeping it out on Saturdays so it would be ready for the Sunday morning public service; many times he himself would slash away at the overgrown


<p632>
632                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  lawns surrounding it with the heavy panga knife, working to the point of exhaustion. When he heard the lawn mowers had at last been procured in Nairobi for this work he was delighted as now the much-neglected, beautiful gardens could be gradually restored. 

 The strain and horror of the months of violent war had particularly affected the health and spirits of Enoch's youngest child, Tahirib, who was approaching her fifteenth birthday. 

 It was the family custom of the Olingas to gather together on holidays and special occasions, and Elizabeth and Enoch decided a reunion should take place around the weekend of Sunday, 16 September, which they hoped, in addition to all being together again, would cheer Tahirib up. 

 Forough was in her late pregnancy and had been badly beaten and kicked when soldiers broke into her home in Fort Portal; she did not know if the baby still lived, and after this attack she and George and the children went to Enoch's home in 

Kampala, where Porough    

 saw a doctor; Elizabeth, however, was not satisfied and insisted that George must take her to a Baha doctor in Mombasa, Kenya, for examination  and treatment, and gave her some money to purchase while there a skirt and blouse for Tahirih as there was nothing to be obtained in Uganda. Enoch told them he would be expecting them back for the family reunion; all of this took place about three weeks before his death. 

 Enoch did not attend the second meeting of the 

Uganda Administrative     

 Committee, which was held on 15 September in the Hazfratu'1-Quds, the Counsellor, Mr. Kolo-nario Oule having specially come from Teso to discuss certain matters with them. In the Kitante Road house only Tahirili, Lennie and Badi were with their parents that weekend; George and his family were still in Kenya, Patrick was delayed on a job in Teso and Godwin was also late in getting home. The arrival of these three sons of Enoch was delayed, seemingly by trivial circumstances, yet thus their lives were saved, for had they returned earlier they would surely have been murdered with the rest. It was the custom of the family in those disturbed times to always leave someone inside the home to protect it, in addition to the houseboy who also acted as gardener and lived next to the house in a separate building. On that Sunday, however, 16 September, Forough reports, Enoch insisted  they should take a picnic lunch and all of them go to Kikaya Hill for the day. 

 Mrs. Catherine Kabali, an Auxiliary Board member, was an eyewitness to the events of those days. 

 The friends were going to the Temple grounds earlier than usual because the Hand of the Cause was going to brief them on the situation of the persecuted Baha'is in Ir6n. 

 She describes Enoch, in his white suit, with his 'brilliant and dignified face', joyfully joining the singing in the Temple service of a Swahili offering, 'Be happy, be happy, because  it is the day of oneness today!' Some Baha young people had come down from Teso with Mr. Oule to help clean up the Temple property and later in the day they provided music; Enoch and Elizabeth joined in the dancing; when Tahirili hung back shyly her parents swept her into the dance too and all danced and danced. 

 Mrs. Kabali writes: 'I remember Elizabeth dancing, waving her hands, not knowing yet she will leave this world tonight. She waved and waved, saying goodbye~' When the family returned home, neighbours later mentioned, Mr. Olinga had seemed in a very good mood, walking about his garden, waving to them and saying 'hello'. After the terrible events of that night the Counsellor, Mr. Peter Vuyiya arrived in Kampala from Nairobi a few days later. His report conveys an accurate observation of the situation in the city at that time, the background against which the terrible drama of Enoch's murder took place: 'Staying in the middle of the town, I had the full effect of the state of anarchy in Kampala at night it was impossible to tell the police Kombis from any other that might have been responsible for murders in the city and its environs. Every night, however, brought with ii the murder of yet another family.' He wisely adds: 'With so much speculation regarding what may have been the motive of the murders, I have thought it more safe to steer clear of the questions why, when and how the murders took place.' 

 With surety we will never know — as with all evil deeds, unwitnessed, in nights of terror and chaos throughout history. 

 From many firsthand accounts, however, the following events of that terrible crime


<p633>
IN MEMORIAM                633

  seem clear: the family had its evening meal together — the houseboy had seen them about to serve it; the dishes were neatly stacked in the kitchen sink as usual, where they were found the next day; the houseboy stated that he was in his room when, about 8.30, he heard someone shaking the gate to the compound and, looking through the window, saw five armed men walking towards the back door leading to the kitchen (it is believed a sixth man was left to guard the gate). 

 They shouted 'Open' and banged on the door. Lennie opened the door and there was a sound of shots; the houseboy fled over the fence to hide in the neighbour's bushes and remained there in terror all night, seeing nothing but hearing shooting and other sounds going on for about two hours; at dawn he ventured out of hiding, went to the house, seeing the body of Enoch lying in the courtyard and inside, all in an inner bedroom, the bodies of Elizabeth, Tahirib, Lennie and Badi, heaped on the floor where they had fallen when shot to death. People were beginning to gather outside and they told him he should inform the police, which he did, and then, with singular loyalty to Enoch and his family, went to Kikaya Hill to give the news. Mr. Oule from Teso, who was sleeping on the Temple property, was informed of the unbelievable tragedy which had taken place; it was only because he wished to go at dawn to the Temple for prayers — not having been in Kampala for some time — that he was not killed also for he invariably stayed in Enoch's home. 

 Mr. Oule, the Board member Catherine Kabali, and her sister Edith Senoga — who both lived on Kikaya Hill — then rushed to the home of Enoch. 

 Their horror and grief at what they found was indescribable. It is greatly to the credit of the African friends in Kampala that, crushed and overwhelmed as they were by this truly staggering tragedy — a tragedy which shocked the Baha'i world to its furthest corners — they went into action immediately and efficiently in spite of their personal, heartrending grief. 

 The oldest pioneer, Claire Gung, frail and in her seventies, was at once informed and was able to telephone Nairobi and give the news. George and his family had motored up on the 16th from Mombasa to Nairobi and at the 

National Headquarters      

 found a telegram from Enoch giving a list of spare parts for his car he wished them to bring in addition to a number of other things he had ordered. Planning to buy these things and then proceed to Kampala — an eight-hour drive — George and Forough went shopping in the city. It was while they were absent the news came from Kampala; the 

Counsellor, Peter Vuyiya   

 was there and was able to telephone the Universal House of Justice, which was in session at the time, and speak to Enoch's spiritual father, 'AU NakhjavAnf. If anything could be considered  fortunate during so much calamity it was this, that the House of Justice was in a position to immediately instruct the friends that the Counsellor Kolonario Oule, together with the 

Uganda Administrative      

 Committee, whose members were already gathered in Kampala, should take charge of the situation, make all necessary arrangements and ensure that a befitting funeral for the Hand of the Cause and his family would take place. 

 The problem facing the Baha'is in Nairobi was how to break the news to George and Forough. 

 To blurt it out was beyond the capacity  of these loving friends, so the National secretary wrote a short, most tender letter of condolence, explaining what had occurred and it was handed to George and Forough when they came back to the Centre. 

 George's one desire was to reach his father and do everything necessary. 

 In spite of remonstrances, the family left for Kisumo that same afternoon and that night George, to his great comfort, was able to talk to 'All 

Nakhjav~ni in Haifa. The   

 next morning, well knowing nothing was available in Uganda, they bought the material for the five shrouds and left for Kampala. 

 In the midst of lamentation and shock, the surviving sons, Patrick and Godwin, joined George; Enoch's two older daughters, Grace and Florence, married and living abroad, hastened to Kampala with their husbands, as did Forough's brother; already friends and relatives had arrived from Teso on the night of the 17th, including the Counsellor, Oloro Epyeru, who had been prevented by illness from coming to Kampala for the meetings of the 

Uganda Administrative      

 Committee;  everyone shared the grief of the children, everyone came to be present at the funeral; the harassed family, for over a week, fed from eighty to one hundred and fifty

  people a day in the Kitante Road home. The bodies of the slain Olingas had been removed to a hospital pending arrangements for the burial. During the hours of curfew every night the city was still racked with gunfire and acts of terrorism, including the murder of many other entire families. Indeed, during that week Enoch's home was subjected one night to heavy gunfire, everyone in the house lying on the floor for protection; fortunately no one was injured and the police put a guard on the building. To make all the arrangements, procure suitable coffins, dig five graves on Kikaya Hill, get the authorities to provide police escort for the funeral cort~ge, find transportation for the coffins, the family and the large throng of mourners — it all required truly herculean efforts. 

 In the world press the murder of Enoch received wide notice: 'A world leader of the Baha'i religious sect, his wife and three children were murdered in the 

Ugandan capital Kampala   

 on Sunday', it spread like wildfire; the Ugandan radio, on 17 September, broadcast the news in six verhacular languages so that the Baha'is throughout the country might be informed of the fate of the 'Father of Victories'. 

 On the morning of 24 September — which coincided with Tahirih's birthday — the five coffins were removed from the mortuary of the hospital and taken to Enoch's home where, flower-draped, they were placed in the sitting-room; prayers were read, and many people came to pay their Last respects; by 12.15 the funeral procession was ready to leave for Kikaya Hill, two motorcycle policemen  preceding it, then a car carrying the Counsellors, followed by the car carrying the coffin of the Hand of the Cause which was followed by another one carrying Elizabeth's coffin and a third carrying the three coffins of the children. 

 It was oniy through the cooperation  of many non-B ahd'i friends that this transport had been procured. Followed by cars bearing the family, the cortege went slowly along Gayaza Road towards the Tem-pie;  hundreds of people lined the streets, some wept while some were heard to cry: 'Look at the bodies! Eli, cli, another one! Oh, another one!' A wave of public sympathy swept the crowd. 

 With great respect the five coffins were placed in a row in the hail of the National Headquarters, flowers laid upon them, and a beautiful and uplifting funeral service held; a number of prominent Ugandan officials, friends of Enoch and admirers of the Faith, attended it. In a burial plot not far from the Temple on Kikaya Hill Enoch Olinga was laid to rest next to Mds6 Ban6nf, his fellow Hand; the one designated the 'Spiritual 

Conqueror  of Africa'    

 w~s joined in death by the 'Father of Victories'. 

 Nearby Elizabeth and Tahirih, Badi and Lennie were placed in their graves. 

 To the Baha'is of the world the Universal House of 

Justice announced Enoch's 

 passing:

  Enoch had an example he used to give to the Baha'is: he said all of us are like guitars; when a guitar hears of a great Divine Musician he hopes to be played upon by this Musician. He offers himself to the 

Supreme Musician. The     

 Musician accepts him, takes the guitar close to Himself, plays upon it. But soon He finds the strings are out of tune. The Musician starts tuning one, winding the string tighter. The pressure is painful to the guitaT, it resists the winding. 

 Then instead of yielding, the string breaks. As it is the wish of the guitar to give forth the divine melody, the great Musician plays upon the strings that remain. But the tune is still wrong. So the Musician starts tuning another string. It resists and finally breaks. Still the guitar wishes to be played upon. The Musician plays upon these

  fewer strings. Again and again a string needs tuning. 

 Again and again the guitar refuses to yield to the winding, the pressure. 

 At last only one string is left and to be faithful to the offer of the guitar the Divine Musician says, 'I will play on this one string.' But that too is out of tune. Again the winding, the terrible pressure, and this one string also breaks. Then the Musician has no choice but to lay the guitar aside. 

 Thus are tests given by God to perfect us, not to destroy us. The destruction comes oniy from our resistance to the tuning. The purpose is not punishment but the intention  to fulfil the desire of the guitar to be played upon. 

 How many tests Enoch surmounted, submitting  in the Hands of his beloved Baha'u'llah, to the tuning of the Divine Musician, until finally the guitar was laid aside for good — but the music remains.

636                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

    Has an M. Baha'i          
                           
Hasan Muvaqqar Baha'i     

 was loved and honoured both in his native fran and his adopted England, and by virtue of his consistent  services in the British Baha community for nearly fifty years earned a central role in its history. A student from his youth, he became in the last decade of his life and in the sight of all the Baha world, its preeminent scholar, yielding place only to Mirza Abu'1-Fadi,  by whose learning Mr. Baha'i was himself astonished. 

 He seemed, from his earliest years, a mature and balanced person, as though his gentle yet remarkable qualities were his by birth — an innate courtesy and kindliness, an easy yet dignified bearing, a delightful wit and humour, an appreciation of every effort or service offered by others for the Faith, understanding of apparent frailties of behaviour, seeing beyond these to the longings and pain of human souls, quiet perseverance in fulfilling his own responsibilities, untarnished steadfastness in his loyalty to the Covenant of Baha'u'llah, complete  and heartfelt obedience to the Central Figures of the Faith and its Guardian, staunch and knowledgeable support of all the institu tions of the Administrative Order — these give but an incomplete portrayal of one whose presence conveyed to those who knew him a sense of wellbeing, tranquillity and hope. 

 At the moment of his first meeting, in his youth, with Shoghi Effendi, his inmost being was quickened to the reality of the Guardian's servitude at the Holy Threshold, and his sensitive, receptive spirit became, and ever remained, centred upon the greatness and glory of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. His life can be understood in no other terms than his striving to serve that Revelation, in whatever course events might take, in health or in sickness, to his closing days in this world, when his utmost longing was to lay his head on the threshold of the Most Holy Shrine and offer to the King of Glory with his own hand the gift of his last, heroid labours. 
                           
   I. Family and Youth        

  -Hasan  Baha'i shared with the Guardian of the Faith descent from the same great-grand-father, HAji Mfrni Abu'1-Q~isim —  — one of the two brothers of Khadfjih-Bagum, the wife of the BTh — whose daughter, F~timih-Su1t6n-Bagum, was Mr. Balyiizf's paternal grandmother.  His paternal grandfather was Mu-hammad-Hasan, a merchant of a Bushire family, whom Baha'u'llah accepted as of the family of the Bib, and a son of this union was Mirza 'AU Aq& later entitled Muvuqqari'd-Dawlih, the father of Ilasan Baha'i. His mother, Munavvar KhAnum traced her descent from both brothers of the wife of the Bab, and thus Mr. l3aly'.izf's 'illustrious lineage' had a twofold bond with KhadijilvBagum for whom he had a particular love and esteem. 

 Abu'1-Q~sim Afnan, close relative of Mr. Baha'i and Custodian of the House of the BTh in Shfr6z has stated that during his pilgrimage the Guardian of the Faith referred to three outstanding members of the Afnin family. The most distinguished was Khadijih Bagum, the wife of the Rib, then 1-Idji Mirza Siyyid 'All, the uncle of the BTh and one of the Seven Martyrs of Tihr4n, while, 'at the present moment', the most distinguished was Hasan Baha'i, and 'all the Afn6n should follow in his footsteps'. 

 Hasan Baha'i was born on 7 September 1908 in Shirhz where, at the age of four, he began to acquire his mastery of the English


<p637>
IN MEMORIAM                637

  language. Most of his early years, however, were-spent t in Bushire where his father — diplomat  and later Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports and Islands — resided, and he entered school when about five. When, in the First World War, Bushire was occupied by British Forces, his father was exiled to India where the family lived in Bombay and then for four years in Poona. 

 They were accompanied by two outstanding scholars, friends of his father, who tutored him in Persian, Arabic and history until he entered Bishop's College in Poona, an English high school where he perfected his English. He also learned Urdu, and is remembered as translating, at about the age of nine, for Abbas Dehkan who first met him there. When his father returned to Tihran after the War to become a member of the Cabinet (Vazir) as Minister of Interior, Hasan attended the Cyrus School, whose headmaster was Prof. ~adfq-A'Lam, Later Persian Ambassador  in London and Minister of Education. A year or so after his father's death in May 1921, he accompanied his mother to Shir6z, but as educational opportunities for him were lacking at that time, in 1925 his uncle addressed  Professor Browne to ask him to take charge of his nephew's education in England, whence Hasan's mother desired to send him. In his reply 5 May 1925 Browne referred to ilasan's father, 'my old friend 'Ali-Muham-mad KhAn Muvaqqari'd-Dawlih, whom I became  acquainted with about 1885 in London under the name of Mirza 'Au AqA and of whom I sa'~v so much in Shfraz in the Spring of 1888', and added: 'I need hardly say how glad I should be to do anything I could for his son. But I am afraid that my health makes it impossible for me to take charge of his education here .' 

 Browne had suffered a severe heart attack some months before and died 5 January 1926. In recounting this incident Hasan comments: 'However I was then not old enough or qualified to enter a university in Britain. 

 Thus it was that I went to Beirut, and to the Preparatory School of the American University there. My journey to England in pursuit of education had to wait for several years when I could come to take up higher studies.' 

 'A Personal Note', written by Mr. Baha'i in May 1969, continues with an account of his journey to Beirut and his memorable welcome in Haifa, at the age of seventeen, by Shoghi Effendi, the young Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. At that time Hasan knew little about the Faith as a religion, although aware of family relationships with 'Abdu'l-Baha, the visits of distinguished Baha'is such as Mirza Malim6d-i-Zarq6ni, and social occasions to which their neighbour in Shir~z had invited him. 
He had, it is true, found  

Some Answered Questions    

 among his father's books and had begun to read it with the intention of rebuttal, but unable to find fault he was left frustrated although interested. On asking for further books he was given a manuscript of the TdrikWi-Jadid. Nonetheless, writes Dr. Moo-jan  Momen, 'had it not been for his meeting with Shoghi Effendi, he would probably have recorded himself as a Muslim at the University', and this is confirmed by Farhang Afnan's comment that 'prior to going to Haifa, in his heart of hearts he could not reconcile himself one hundred per cent that there could be any prophet after Mu4arnmad This is Hasan's own description: 'My route to Beirut was through the Red Sea, Port Said, Haifa. It was in the latter part of 

Nov6mber 1925 and John     

 Ebenezer Esslemont, the immortal author of Baha'u'llah and the New Era, lay mortally ill in the old Pilgrim House. His illness greatly occupied the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. 

 'During my stay of one night (November 

2lst — 22nd) on Mount Carmel 

 two eminent Persian Baha physicians who were there, Dr. 

Y6nis KhAn Afr6klitih      

 and Dr. Arastii KLPn Hakfm, were called in the early hours of the morning to Dr. Esslemont's bedside. Shoghi Effendi sat up with him through the night. 

 'The next day I left for Beirut in the company of Dr. Afr6khtih and Dr. Hakim. 

 'It was that bounty of meeting Shoghi Effendi and all that I saw in him, which confirmed me in the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 The course of my life was changed.' 

 Dr. Momen has supplemented this account with notes taken during various conversations with Mr. Baha'i: 'He was taken to the house of the Master and put into a drawing-room all by himself. He did not know what was going to happen. Suddenly Shoghi Effendi entered the room. 

 Baha'i rose and wanted to kiss his hand [as was the Persian custom], 

 but Shoghi Effendi would not allow this and instead


<p638>
638                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  embraced him. Then Shoghi Effendi sat him down and talked with him for more than an hour. What particularly impressed Hasan was the way in which Shoghi Effendi would answer a problem or a question by drawing the answer out of the questioner 'And so it was that his Faith was confirmed and when he went on to Beirut and at the University he was asked his religion for the official forms, he said "Baha'i".' 

 In the words of Mrs. Ba~y6zf, ~Hasan was so struck by the kindness and courtesy of the Guardian, at such an anxious time, to a boy of seventeen, that from that time he became confirmed in the Faith.' 

 Hasan spent seven years, 1925 — 1932, in Beirut, reading for a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry after a preparatory year, and then turning to a study of Diplomatic History for an M.A. 'He took a full part in University life,' writes Mrs. Baha'i, 'playing football and tennis, and engaging in the activities of the Dramatic Society, the Debating Society and of course the Baha'i Society.' 

 In his brief time with the Guardian he had accepted the Faith of Baha'u'llah with his whole heart and at once became one of its most active supporters. 

 According to the Hand of the Cause Abu'1-Q6sim 

Faizi, the 'beloved Guardian

 encouraged the Persian youths [to] continue their studies in the American University of Beirut, rather than going straight from Persia to the European countries Gradually it became a centTe of attraction', the 'number of Baha'i students increased, and this large community needed a brotherly leadership. 

 This mantle suited' Hasan Baha'i, who had been one of the first of the Baha'i students there. 

 'With great wisdom and heartfelt affiliation to the Cause of God', he gathered the students together, arranged weekly programmes in the home of the IqMl family, encouraged every student to prepare a talk in English on an aspect of the Faith, and reported to Shoghi Effendi the details of an annual meeting. Tie also sought permission from the Guardian for the Baha students to visit Haifa during their Easter holiday, and Mr. Faizi recalled that Shoghi Effendi advised them to come in small groups at Easter and other holidays as well. It was Hasan who planned the prayers and readings whenever his and Mr. Faizi's group met the Guardian. 'That was the happiest period of our lives when dear Hasan put all of us on a path conducive to the approval and appreciation of the beloved Guardian.' And after he had departed to study in London, 'he kept us happy and uplifted us by his beautiful letters'. 

 In February 1932, because of work on his thesis at Easter, he obtained permission to visit Haifa in the midterm break. 

 He was accompanied by his brother and Mr. Faizi, 'and Hasan believed that it was the first occasion on which pilgrimage had included a visit to the newly-restored Mansion of Baha. Lie never met Shoghi Effendi again'. 

(Moojan Momen)             
                           
  II. The British Isles      

  In September 1932, following his studies in Beirut, 'Hasan came to London armed with a letter of recommendation from his professor', Dr. Roger H. Soltan, to Prof. Harold Laski at the London School of Economics, and was accepted as a postgraduate student. 

 He read Diplomatic History, with special reference to the relations of the European Powers to the Persian Gulf States, and in 1935 received his M.Sc.(Econ.). 

 He pursued his studies in the field of British 

Public Opinion on Franco-German 
Relations after World      

 War I, but his thesis for a doctorate was delayed by the difficulty of finding a suitable supervisor and the outbreak of the Second World War cut short his university career. 

 Within months of his arrival in London, Hasan was elected at Ridvan 1933 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the British Isles and also to the 

London Spiritual Assembly. 

 Administration was little past its infancy in Britain at the time of 1-lasan's arrival. An editorial note in Unfolding  Destiny, a collection of the Guardian's letters to the British Baha'i Community, states that from the end of 1930 until early 1934 only five or six short meetings a year were recorded in the 'scanty Minutes of the National Assembly' and no records exist of messages from the Guardian. 

 It was at this juncture that Hasan was faced with a decision that would change the pattern of his life. He had published in a Persian newspaper an article on the current political


<p639>
IN MEMORIAM                639

  situation in Europe, but on 8 February 1934 the Guardian addressed him through his secretary, expressing astonishment, after, his own 'repeated and emphatic warnings to the friends that they should refrain from participating whether directly or indirectly in any political activity .' We cannot know what thoughts and emotions may have disquieted this young scholar, standing at the threshold of a beckoning career, but the nature of his reply to the Guardian is attested in a long and significant letter from Shoghi Effendi dated 2 

March:                     

 He was much impressed by your immediate  response and he has deeply appreciated the firm decision you have taken not to enter any political ordiplomatic career. He is fully conscious of the sacrifices you have accepted to undergo for the sake of maintaining the integrity of the Teachings. For the field of work which your parents wanted you to enter was one in which you had great possibilities  of progress, and you might have even had a chance to attain the position which your father had occupied in the ministry. 

 But you can be certain that the example you have set before the friends by refusing to meddle in any sort of political activity is one which all of them will appreciate and through which they will be encouraged to suffer even greater sacrifices. 

 The Cause, indeed, can progress only through the continued and wholehearted sacrifices of the believers. And it is on young, intelligent and well-educated Baha'is like yourself that has been laid the chief responsibility of demonstrating to the friends and to the nonbelievers alike, that the spirit of heroism, of loyalty and of unqualified devotion to the Faith is more than ever animating the faithful and is moulding and shaping their lives And I am sure you fully realize that nothing short of such an attitude can effectively maintain the unity of the Faith and insure the stability ~nd the efficient working of its newborn institutions.' (through his secretary) A plan then in 1-lasan's mind, to work in the offices of the League of Nations in Geneva, was fully approved by Shoghi Effendi provided the work would be 'purely administrative',  but his closing advice was to retain his membership 'both in the N.S.A. and in the London Assembly. 

 Your cooperation has been greatly appreciated by all our English friends, and it is hoped that this will encourage you to continue working with them.' (through his secretary) Many years later, when klasan's handsome inheritance of properties and wealth in frdn offered him every comfort and ease of living in that country, lie explained to Dr. Jraj Ayman why he did not take this up. 'I am oniy interested in serving the Cause wherever the beloved Guardian wants me to serve and I am not a bit interested in all that belongs to me in IrAn.' For a quarter of a century he would devote himself to the progress of the Faith in the British Isles, until his responsibilities as a Hand of the Cause would call him to wider fields. 

 Already by 1935 his presence in London  was 'a tremendous and unique help to the friends' and he had 'indeed, contributed a valuable share towards the expansion and consolidation of the Movement not only in London but in some other parts of England as well.' (secretary of the Guardian, probably writing personally) The year 1936 signalled a marked increase of Baha'i activities, when a young 

English Baha'i, David      

 Jlofman, arrived in the spring from America where he had experienced various aspects of the evolving 

Administrative Order.      

 He became secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly at Ridvan of that year and Hasan assistant secretary. For a good many years these two cooperated in manifold services to the Cause they both loved, together  with others whose names are now part of Baha'i history in the 

British Isles.             

 In rapid succession during the few years before the outbreak of war in September 1939, a teaching campaign throughout England was inaugurated (1936), the first official Baha Summer School was held, the Baha'i Journal was initiated, an annual midwinter

 began, the Publishing Trust was established and issued its first two publications in 1938, a monthly magazine, New World Order, was founded (1939), and the long-sought legal incorporation of the N.S.A. was achieved in August 1939, Hasan being one of the nine signatories as a 'research student'. 

 In all of these national activities Hasan took an active part, not only as an officer of the N.S.A., but often as Convention chairman, Summer School organizer and teacher, a member of the Reviewing

  tee, an active participant at Teaching Conference, a contributor to New World Order, and a travelling teacher in England both north and south. At the same time he was a member of the London Assembly and the London Baha Youth Group which earned the congratulations  of the Guardian for its 'splendid achievements' and he was 'acclaimed as a first-rate  speaker'. 

 He has been described in those early years by several who knew him. 

 'He was young, attractive and very courteous 'Nobody was more patient, considerate, informative and humorous. He was both gentle and wise His temperament was quiet and conciliatory.' on a boy of nine his absolute calm, and the love that poured out when he spoke made an indelible impression One grew up under his patience, kindliness, wisdom and love.. .' 

(Ursula Saman-dart  Louis  
Ross-Enfield and Hugh      

 McKinley in that order) Often he and Molly Brown, his future wife, came to Baha'i firesides and social occasions, including evenings at the home of Lady Blomfield. 'On every occasion Hasan and Molly brought out the best in everyone.' 

 He 'had a deep love and respect for the early believers in the British community, such as beloved Lady Blomfield, dear old and gallant Miss Gamble, Mine Scaramucci, Mrs. George and Mrs. Slade, and they in turn had a deep affection for him. 

 Another very touching relationship was with darling Mr. 

Azgarzadeh                 

 •    He used to give Persian Feasts, and Hasan was always the honoured guest.' 

(Louis Ross-Enfield, Ursula
Samandari)                 

 As war loomed on the horizon, Shoghi Effendi expressed his delight 'with the work which is being so energetically conducted, •    and particularly by their national elected  representatives whose magnificent efforts, courage and perseverance deserve the highest praise .' 

(10 February 1939) The     

 Guardian's  love and concern for the English Baha'is was never more evident than during the years of the Second World War, as his more than threescore messages during these years attest. The friends, for their part, prosecuted their teaching campaign with increasing vigour and in ever-widening circles despite 'the unprecedented calamities and confusion that now afflict their country'. (Shoghi Effendi, 

22 November 1940) Hasan    

 had become vice-chairman chairman of the National 

Assembly at Ridvan 1940    

 and that summer moved with the newly-created Persian Section of the B.B.C., to which he had been appointed as a senior member, to Evesham in Worcestershire where broadcasting was carried on until August 1942 when the Department returned to London. His appointment had assured his continued residence in England when war began. 

 We are indebted to Mrs. Baha'i and Abbas Dehkan, whom he invited to join the B.B.C., for a description of his professional work, which included a great deal of original writing of special features such as talks on English writers and history, translating English poetry and short stories, giving talks on current affairs, translating and announcing routine news bulletins (later taken over by junior staff), writing plays and performing in them, assisting in productions of Shakespeare, and presenting a series of English by Radio. 

 He resigned from the B.B.C. in 1958, but continued for some years with particular assignments.  A three-month tour of duty in Iran in 1956 for the B.B.C. enabled him to attend to family affairs in and near ShfrAz after the death of his mother, visit Isfahhn and stay a few days in Tihr~n where, as chairman of the British National Assembly, he made contact with its sister Assembly in fran. 

 It was his first visit since he had left his homeland as a youth, and it was to be his last. 

 Dr. Iraj Ayman has given the following fascinating glimpse of Irlasan in his professional  career. 

 Among his colleagues were several distinguished Iranian scholars and writers, men such as MujtaM Minuvi, 

Mas'fld Farz4d and Guichin.

 He himself produced more than a thousand radio programmes on Iran and its history and literature, and some of his translations of English literature have become part of modern Persian literature. He contributed to the development of the Persian language, as well, by coining many words now commonly used in IrAn in the translation of modern terms, and he also 'made new and different uses of old words to convey new meanings'. 

 Indeed, 'his style, his mastery of and his special approach to Persian were unique and highly appreciated' by Iranian writers. 

 It was during this period that Hasan wrote A Guide to the Administrative 

Order (1941)


<p641>
IN MEMORIAM                641

  and gave invaluable assistance to the editor of The Chosen Highway by Lady Blom-field, whose death on 31 December 1939 had 'robbed the Cause in England' of her 'ready and invaluable support'. 

 (Shoghi Effendi  through his secretary, 18 February 1940) In June 1941 Hasan and Mary (Molly) Brown were married in the Baha'i 

Centre in Torquay. The    

 daughter of Kathleen Brown (later, Lady Hornell), who was one of England's most steadfast and active Baha'is, Molly bad been a member of the Sadler's Wells Ballet before marriage. 

 Their first son, Hushang, was born in Evesham in 1942 and during the next years there were four other sons, Robert, Felix, Richard and Simeon. 'A girl has not been born into our family for two hundred years,' Hasan told Alma 

Gregory.                  

 Molly had many gifts and, on a number of occasions, assisted Hasan in the production of dramatic scripts about the Faith which he or Mary Basil Hall had written, creating 'performances  of moving distinction'. (Hugh McKinley) And 'when he and Molly and their children came to Summer School they brought a joyous atmosphere'. 

 (Ursula Samandari) No doubt Hasan recognized the unequal share which fell to Molly, as she gave herself to the care and rearing of their young family. 'So gifted herself, she devoted her life to enable others to express their gifts.' (ibid.) But it was a willing choice, for Molly preferred, she has said, her role at home to a more public one. It can truly be said that they sustained and complemented each other throughout the nearly forty years of marriage. A friend who visited them in 1979 was 'much touched by the love and consideration which they showed for each other. I realized that he could not do his vastly important work without her devoted care.' 

 (0. Z. Whitehead) And after his passing Molly described herself as fortified 'against any and every pressure' by 'his love, forethought, wisdom and discernment'. 

 1-lasan, for his part, deeply cherished his sons, prayed for their spiritual progress, took pride in their scholarly achievements, but was prevented by his work schedule with the B.B.C. and his Baha'i responsibilities from spending much time with them. 'What was Ito do?' was his sad lament shortly before his death. 

 In 1942 Hasan became chairman of the N.S.A., a post to which he was elected annually for seventeen years (excluding 1943 —  1944). 'Who that ever served on the N.S.A. with him can ever forget his unending, loving patience, his deep sympathy and his profound wisdom and his lovable hilarity?. 

 Who can ever forget the lunch, tea and supper breaks of N.S.A. meetings with beloved Hasan entertaining us with his lighthearted stories and anecdotes? He was such a perfect chairman,' wrote Ursula Samandari, 'that I could never believe the British Community could be the same' when, in 1960, he retired from membership. And Philip Hams-worth  has added: ... I can remember only the joy of those meetings, an eagerness and excitement which I never seem to have recaptured'; Hasan was 'a very great gentle man who influenced my Baha'i life in a way he probably never suspected'. 

 Although the most demanding of Hasan's time and energy, his N.S.A. service was by no means all he was doing. Over the years he was often chairman of the Annual Convention and of the London Spiritual Assembly. When special committees were formed, whether to formulate publishing policy (1942) or plan press publicity for the completion of the exterior of the BakEf Temple in Wilmette (1943), or prepare a history of the Faith in the British Isles for the 1944 Centenary, or examine how to promote the Six Year Plan (1944), Hasan was secretary or member. He accepted whatever needed doing, for years addressing and dispatching the Bahd'iJournal to the national community. 

 And always he spoke, at Summer Schools, the gnnual Teaching  Conferences, public meetings and firesides. 

 'I was once chairman at Summer School when he spoke about 'Abdu'l-Baha; there was not a dry-eyed member of the audience.' (Ursula 

Samandarf)                

 Indeed, the record of his services on national committees, from 1943 to 1960, and often for several years, is daunting to the reader. Reviewing, New World Order, Literature (secretary), Archives (eleven years), National Contacts and Public Relations, National Scripts,

  lation and Maintenance plus Reception Committees for the Haziratu'1-Quds 

(1955 — 1956), Haziratu'1-Quds

 (1956 — 1957) — the very names elicit memories of the development of the British Baha'i community. 

 Although listed as a member of the newly-appointed Persian Committee oniy for four years (between 1950 and 1956), Hasan was always in close touch with the young Persians who came to Britain for education. 

 'It is clear that he exerted a most beneficial influence on all the Persian friends. 

 He was beloved by them and he encouraged their participation in Baha'i activities.' (Ursula 

Samandarf) At Sununer      

 Schools, which he regularly attended, 'be would either conduct sessions in Persian or would brief Persian friends after each session. On a number of occasions he mentioned that the frequency and amount of references to him by Persian believers' exceeded those of the N.S.A. 'Once I asked him how he could attend to all these different and almost contradictory engagements. He pointed to his chair and desk in the corner of the room in the old apartment' where they were living and said, '"many nights I sit there all night and do not go to bed". 

 I specially verified this with Molly and Lady Hornell I asked him how he could subject himself to such continuous hardship' and he replied, 'whenever I think of what our beloved Guardian is doing for us I am ashamed of how little we are doing in response and sleep escapes my eyes'. (Iraj Ayman) An English believer of early days remembered: 'I used to go with him and other Persian students on picnics We had great times together. 

 He was always witty with inborn gentleness, that shone from his eyes.' (Louis 

Ross-Enfield) And a Persian

 Baha'i, Habib Hazari, who came to England in 1950 has described what he must have meant to them all: 'I was showered by his kindness, generosity and affection.' About 1951 'I wrote to the Guardian and said, "His inspiration in serving the Faith is this verse of the Aqdas: 'Observe My commandments for the love of My beauty.' 

 He is kind to everyone, and is the best and closest friend and counsellor to the Baha'i friends A few weeks later I received a letter from Dr. Hakim, including "What you have said about the Afn6n, Hasan Muvaqqar Baha'i, was also noted by the Guardian, who said, 'Write [to Habfb]: "Yes, you are right."' Then he said: 'I pray for him, he can be sure.'"' As early as Ridvan 1943 the Guardian directed the thoughts of the British Baha'is to the Centenary of the Declaration of the BTh. He was anxious that 'the British Baha'is should demonstrate to the public and to their fellow believers, the vitality of their community and the marked advancement it has made of late.' 

 (through his secretary, 17 June 1943) Hasan was chairman of the Centenary Committee and secretary of the committee  which produced The Centenary of a World Faith, subtitled 'The History of the Baha 

Faith and Its Development  
in the British Isles.'     

 It was 'most excellently gotten out and not oniy well written but calculated to arouse the interest of the reader and impress him with the true stature of our World Faith'. (Shoghi Effendi through his secretary, 12 August 1944) During the weeklong programme  opened by Sir Ronald Storrs at the Centenary Exhibition, a review of Baha history in dramatized form was presented by Flasan, who was also one of the speakers at the large public meeting on 23 May. The 'patient efforts and sacrifices of the members of the N.S.A., and all those who contributed to the marked success of the Centenary celebrations brought happiness to his often heavily overburdened heart,' wrote the Guardian's secretary in the same letter. 

 It was during the historic Convention of that week that the delegates resolved to inaugurate a Six Year Plan for teaching and turned to the Guardian to fix the goal. His reply on 25 May signalized a great new phase for the British community: 

WELCOME SPONTANEOUS  DECISION.
ADVISE FORMATION NINETEEN 
SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLIES       
SPREAD OVER ENGLAND  WALES
SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND  

  AND EIRE At that time there were no believers in the British Isles beyond England except 

George Townshend!          
  Throughout the Six Year    

 Plan Hasan's administrative burdens were in no way lessened;  indeed, the claims on the N.S.A. and its officers multiplied as the Plan progressed and the challenge to the community intensified. 

At the Teaching Conference 

 of February 1946, a turning~point for the Plan when the nine goal towns of the Initial Phase were chosen, the N.S.A. session lifted the friends to a 'realm of


<p643>
IN MEMORIAM                643

  dedication and spiritual resolution, which was immeasurably reinforced by Hasan Balyiizf's inspired message'. There are reports of his speaking in Northampton, Torquay, Exeter, Leeds, and he is on the 'honour roll' of travelling teachers, participating fully in the Summer Schools which were so crucial to winning the Plan, and chairing the 1949 Teaching Conference, attended by Mrs. Amelia Collins, when 'the very room seemed to vibrate with the power of the Cause'. And then, following a year of deep anxiety, at the victory Convention of 1950 'our dear, perennial Hasan Baha'i read the cable, and so the whole tone of Convention was set'. HEART FLOODED JOY were the Guardian~s opening words; it was a moment no one present will ever forget. 

 Never one to pause in his compelling vision of the ultimate triumph of the Faith, the Guardian in this same message called on the British community to BRACE ITSELF 

EMBARK                     
AFrER ONE YEAR RESPITE     

 YET ANOTHER HISTORIC UNDERTAKING, and he sketched the outlines of the Two Year Plan or African Campaign. It was the first stage in the Divine Plan in which several National Assemblies would march together, and the British N.S.A.'s trust was to be 'the consultative body for all African territories' with whom 'the other National Assemblies should keep in close touch The time was indeed short until the centenary in 1953 of the birth of Baha'u'llah's prophetic mission in the SiyAh-ChAL. Yet despite the brevity of the Two Year Plan it was laden with unimagined significances, first indicated by Shoghi Effendi on 16 January 1951 when in four score words he unveiled the events of the next thirty years and far beyond. 

 The African Teaching Conference, in which 123 African Baha'is of some thirty tribes participated with many other believers, was the first of four Intercontinental Conferences convened in 1953. It was the British N.S.A.'s responsibility to plan it, in cooperation with the five other National Assemblies of the Plan, and its chairman's responsibility to convene it. In the event, Hasan and John and Dorothy Ferraby, all N.S.A. officers, attended this unique Conference which, with the three to follow, launched the FATE-LADEN, LADEN, SOUL-STIRRING, 

DECADE-LONG, WORLD-EMBRACING 

 SPIRITUAL CRUSADE known as the Ten Year Plan. It was Flasan's first mission overseas, during which he presided over all sessions, spoke at the public meeting in Makerere University College, and participated in the two consultations of the N.S.A. representatives with the Hands of the 

Cause.                     

 Once again the Guardian, in his long cablegram to the 1953 British Baha'i Convention,  after warmly congratulating the delegates 

ON MAGNIFICENT VICTORIES

  We are grateful to the Hand of the Cause Dr. Ugo Giachery for a description of Hasan at this time: 'The first time I met him was in 1953 at the 

Stockholm Conference;      

 he was young, elegant, soft-spoken, gentle and graceful.  His luxuriant black hair enhanced the handsomeness of his countenance; to me he appeared the embodiment of the perfect Persian aristocrat. His linguistic ability was truly superb In Stockholm he was happy and exuberant, and Angeline and I became his good friends.' 

 Uasan carried great responsibilities in the World Crusade for, apart from his chairmanship of the N.S.A. during the first seven years, he served on five national committees including chairmanship (1953 — 1957) of the European  and Asian 

Teaching Committee which Wad

 under its wing the Knights of Baha'u'llah opening seven European goals and consolidation  of the Faith in Eire and Hong Kong. Barbara Lewis, its secretary, recalls Hasan's chairmanship: 'I remember how much I learnt about Baha'i affairs, and how to handle them, from his loving and wise direction of the Committee He was, I felt, a man of great stature, and of outstanding qualities, and these he brought to bear in his guidance to the Committee during consultation about the wellbeing of those Knights of Baha'u'llah

  with whom we were concerned His has been a lasting influence on me throughout the thirty years I've been a Baha'i' One ought to remember as well his young family of five sons,. the eldest eleven when the Ten Year Phn began. And for almost seventeen  years he accepted into his home and caje his young relative, Farhang Afnan. 'From the moment when I first saw him [September 1951], I was enraptured by his kindness, gentleness and understanding. As time passed, I came to realise more and more what a unique person he was... He was like a many faceted precious jewel.' 

 The first year of the Crusade elicited an expression of the Guardian's pride in the British community's RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS; all their overseas goals had been filled and their Local Assemblies at home maintained. At the same time a strenuous search was being pursued for a National f{aziratu'1-Quds in London. Over thirty properties were considered  and many viewed before success, hailed by the Guardian as a 

HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT.     
(16 October 1954) Hasan    

 and two Hands of the Cause, Dr. Grossmann and Mr. Urns, spoke during the Teaching 

Conference and Dedication  
held on 15 January 1955.   

 Hasan's next mission overseas occurred at Ridvan 1956 when as N.S.A. chairman he convened in Kampala, Uganda, the first Convention of the Baha'is of Central and East Africa, meeting for the election of their dwn Regional Spiritual Assembly oniy five years after the inception of the 

African Campaign. 'My      

 heart brims with joy and my soul is uplifted with thankfulness', were the Guardian's  words as he greeted the four African Conventions, paying a 'warm and heartfelt tribute' to all who had contributed to 'so coloss4 an enterprise', including the members of the six National Assemblies supporting the work, and appealing to them 'not to abandon these fledgling African Baha communities •   .' Ijasan performed other services in Kampala, including an introductory talk for the viewing of the cloak of Baha'u'llah, a press interview and radio broadcast. The following. weekend in Leicester he described to the British Convention the exciting events of the African Convention, the 'staunchness and divotion' of the African Baha'is, the tremendous  sacrifices of the pioneers, and some of the challenging problems confronting the new Regional Assembly. He had promised to raise their cry for assistance, and this he did most movingly in 

Leicester.                 

 Ever since the appointment of the first contingent of the Hands of the Cause in December 1951, the British Baha'is had received the blessing and guidance of their 

OWfl DEARLY LOVED MUCH     
ADMIRED GREATLY GIFTED     
OUTSTANDING HAND CAUSE     
GEORGE                     

  TOWNSHEND, thus extolled by the Guardian on the occasion of his death in March 1957. It was only five months later, in his last major letter to the National Assembly, that intriguing reference was made to their 'future Hands', a puzzle soon resolved in his message to the Baha'i world, October 1957, in which eight more Hands were appointed. 

 They included the chairman and secretary of the British National Assembly, 

Hasan Baha'i, 'representing 

 the Afn6n', and John Ferraby. In reply to the N.S.A.'s cable of gratitude came these final words of the beloved Guardian to the British friends: 

CONFIDENT BRITISH          
COMMUNITY RICHLY DESERVES  
NEW HONOUR.                
                           
SHOGHI. (11 October 1957)  
                           
III. The Hand of the Cause 

  Who could foresee at that joyous hour of the receipt of the October message from Shoghi Effendi, vibrant with his vision of the fourth phase of the World Crusade and the five Intercontinental Conferences to inaugurate it, that this would be his last call to action to the Baha'i world, that the next messages would be from Abdu'l-Baha Ri2~yyih NM-num  announcing his passing on 4 November in London and his funeral a few days later? In her hour of indescribable shock and gTief, with the need to convey this terrible news to the Baha'is, she thought, she has written, 'of the two British Hands of the Cause, so recently eleva$ed to this high rank She first turned to Hasan Baha'i, an Afndn cousin of his who, on arrival, telephoned 

John Ferraby; the Hand     

 of the Cause Ugo Giachery was also called and arrived that night. From 'the very day of his ascension', these four Hands 'became responsible for all the pressing matters that had to be attended to in such a short space of time The following afternoon  Hasan and Dr. Giachery accompanied her 'to inspect possible sites for the grave


<p645>
IN MEMORIAM                645

  within an hour's journey from London'. At twilight they found the spot we know, 'then proceeded to the undertaker's, to choose a suitable casket for the precious remains of the beloved Guardian'. 

 The heartrending details of these days, 4 to 9 November, a few lines of which are here quoted, have been recounted by RiThfyyih 

KMnum in The Passing      

 of Shoghi Effendi (The Baha'i World, vol. XIII, pp. 207 — 225). It remains only to record, for this memorial article, that beside the grave, after the believers had filed by for over two hours to pay their respects, a prayer was chanted in Persian and then 'the Afn6n Hand of the Cause, Jiasan Baha'i, read the closing prayer in 

English'.                 

 On 18 November, just a fortnight after the passing of the Guardian, twenty-six Hands of the Cause assembled in the Holy Land 'to consult together on the most tragic situation facing the Baha'is since the Ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha .' Next morning nine of them, including klasan, were 'chosen by R6hiyyih KhAnum to examine the Guardian's apartment'. 

 Their 'thorough search' revealed 'that no Will or Testament of any nature whatsoever executed by Shoghi Effendi had been found', and this they 'reported to the entire body of the Hands assembled in the Mansion of Baha'u'llah in Baha .' (ibid. p. 341) Stunned, bewildered, overwhelmed at this discovery that no Will had been left, no heir appointed, the Hands had no choice but to accept the fate which had befallen them. As 'Chief Stewards' they must guide the Baha'is of the world for almost six years in the knowledge that they were bereft of infallible divine guidance until the Universal House of Justice could be brought into being. 

 For a week, in session in the Mansion, they considered  this situation. 

 During this time the two Hands of the Cause, 

Hasan Baha'i and Abu'1-Qfisim

 Faizi, alternated in translating their consultations, in itself a wearying task for men already bowed by the events just past. The outcome of their deliberations was reported  in a Proclamation which outlined a number of actions including the constitution of 'a body of nine Hands to serve at the Baha'i World Centre' whom they later designated 'the Custodians of the Baha'i World Faith'; among the nine was klasan Baha'i. 

The                       

 imprint of these three weeks on Hasan has been noted by Dr. Giachery, referring to his elevation to the rank of a Hand of the Cause of God. 'His exultation, alas, was of very short duration. 

 Twenty days later, the sudden demise of Shoghi Effendi dealt him a deadly blow, from which he never recovered.' 

 It was expected that Hasan, after settling his affairs in London, would come to Haifa to pursue this new and weighty responsibility, and preparation was made for him to share a room near the gate of the Master's House with his dear and old friend, Abu'1-Q~sim Faizi, but at the last minute he was unable to return. He consulted his fellow Hands at the 1958 Conclave, hoping to find a solution to personal  problems which prevented his service. 

 It would seem that no path opened, for his replacement was announced in November 1959, but he continued as an alternate Hand in the Hoiy Land, spending weeks, sometimes months, in Haifa. 

 Perhaps his outstanding contribution  was in the preparation of archives for removal to the International Archives Building, when he assisted Riihfyyih KMnum for several months in 1959 and 1961. The Hand of the Cause 'Ali-Akbar Furiitan and Mr. Ian Semple — both of whom, with the Hand of the Cause A. 0. Faizi, participated in this work — have described the importance of Hasan's part, when his wide knowledge enabled him to identify Tablets and other materials. 'I had met many Baha'i scholars in IrAn,' Mr. Furatan told the writer, 'but he was to me one of the outstanding figures I have never found in my life such a modest and humble man as Baha'i I loved him dearly.' And Dr. Giachery has written: 'As Custodian at the World Centre, for some months, I had the good chance to know him better and ever more admire his noble character and sterling qualities. 

 His life df service and spiritual obedience and sacrifices remains an effulgent example to emulate.' Though work may have filled their days in Haifa, nights at the Eastern Pilgrim House were lightened by Hasan's humour. He would quote a Persian expression and then laugh and laugh, Mr. Furtitan recalled; while Mrs. Fun? tan described him as 'such a delightful man', recounting stories of Persia at table; he was 'really wonderful'. 

 He also attended the annual  Conclaves of the Hands of the Cause at


<p646>
646                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the World Centre, including the one in 1963 which opened in Haifa in April before the election of the Universal House of Justice and closed in London in the week following the World Congress. As in 1957 he translated a great part of the sessions. 

 From the hour of his appointment as Hand of the Cause, he devoted his energies to the successful consummation of the Guardian's Crusade, then nearly halfway to its close. 'There is much that oniy the future can reveal,' he wrote on his return from the first Conclave. 'But still through this dark night of our souls, there beams powerful and luminous as ever, the floodlight of the Guardian's guidance. 

 He has left us all that we need to carry us to the "Most Great Jubilee", and beyond to the day where once again the gates of Divine guidance will be opened and the Universal House of Justice will come to be.' And he added this sentence, truly a key to his motivation as a Baha'i, frequently mentioned by him and observed by others over the years: 'If only we live the words of the Master's prayer, Make me as dust in the pathway of Thy loved ones, our victory is secure.' (Baha'i Journal, 

January 1958)              

 Within a week after receipt in Britain of the Proclamation of the Hands, Hasan met representatives from all Local Assemblies and major national committees in the lulaziratu'1-Quds to explain the situation in the Faith, and did so again in January at the Annual Teaching Conference in Leeds when his talk 'was moving beyond the power of words to describe'. 

(Baha'i Journal, February  

 1958) He attended the opening of the Baha'i Centre in Leicester in mid-February, spoke at weekend  schools in Manchester, Cambridge and Brighton, and was elected an officer of Convention  at Ridvan and once again to the National 

Spiritual AssemiMy.        
   Meanwhile, a Conference    

 of the European Hands with their two Auxiliary 

Boards (the Protection     

 Board but recently formed) was held in Berne in February 1958. For Ijasan it was the first of ten such Conferences he attended between 1958 and June 1964, always  contributing much wise and piactical advice and sharing chairmanship with his fellow Hands. 

 Concerning these Conferences, which often included members of the European  National Spiritual Assemblies, the International ternational Baha Council noted their 'immense value to the work on that continent. 

 the experience of a number of Baha'i institutions consulting together in this way for the service of the Cause and their mutual help, is unforgettably moving.' (Baha'i Journal, November  1961) Two of the Conferences coincided with greater events: the Frankfurt International 

Teaching Conference       

 in July 1958 and the laying of the cornerstone of the European Temple in November 1960. Hasan participated in both events, so intimately related to the vision and instructions of the Guardian. 'His love for the Guardian was extraordinary,' Mr. Furtitan has said of his fellow Hand. 'He was always speaking of him, quoting him. His main theme, when I was with him, was the Guardian.' And so it was at the close of the Frankfurt Conference when Hasan, with the other Hands of the Cause, bade farewell to the believers. 
'What more can I say?      

 There are many things I do not know, but one thing I do know. Now is the time to show our faithfulness to our beloved Guardian.' 

 Hasan's personal relationship with Auxiliary  Board members in the British 

Isles, as a European Hand  

 of the Cause, must also be mentioned. From the experience of two such members, it can be said that he was prompt and businesslike in replying to their reports, shared these with his fellow Hands and took action as needed, dealt with their needs whether financial or for guidance, always encouraged them, trusted their judgement, and wrote in an unassuming spirit, at times signing himself 'Gratefully and lovingly in His Fellowship'. 

 Yet another aspect of Hasan's international service was his journey in April 1961 to Ecuador and Peru, where he represented the World Centre at the first Conventions of their national Baha'i communities. A report from Peru expressed gratitude for his 'patient explanations, his dignified, loving manner and wonderful sense of humour .' (Baha'( News, no. 364, p. 4) Following the first elections of these National Spiritual Assemblies,  Ilasan went north to cross Canada during May. Here, in addition to meeting the friends, he visited a number of Indian Reserves,  including Indians of Ontario, the Poorman 

Reserve in Saskatchewan    
where he


<p647>
IN MEMORIAM               647

  was honoured by a powwow, the Muscow-petung  Reserve, the Peigan Reserve in 

Alberta,  and Indians     
of British Columbia.       

 His talks were 'simple and direct', appealing 'to the heArts of the many who came to hear him'. (ibid. no. 366, p. 9) Later he described these meetings as 'very wonderful', commending to British Baha'is the initiative of individuals upon whom 'so much depends', and expressing  his confidence in the rapid acceptance of the Faith by Indians. 

 Again in 1962 Irlasan attended first National Conventions, this time in Holland and Denmark, as representative of the World Centre. 

 Were one to analyse, year by year, Hasan's travels to three continents in his first six years as a Hand of the Cause, and couple his schedule with one detailing his continuous activities within the British Isles in accordance with his habitual pattern in past decades, his perseverance in service to the Guardian's Crusade would stand out brilliantly. 

 Records show his attendance at the annual Teaching Conferences of 1959, 1960 and 1962; his visits in June and July 1960 to Bangor (Northern Ireland), 

Edinburgh and Manchester   

 and his meeting with Baha'is of the Southern Region; his stirring review at the 

1960 Convention of British 

 Baha'i history as bearing on present responsibilities; his course on the Covenant at the Harlech Summer School of 1960 when, with the Hand of the Cause 

Adelbert Mtihl-schiegel    

 'their radiant personalities filled our days'; his address for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Master's visit to England at the National Celebration in London, September 1961, sharing the platform with the Hand of the Cause Leroy 

Loas; a similar Celebration

 in Edinburgh in January 1963 of 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit there, addressed by Hasan and Dr. Mflhlschlegel; and a number of important messages which he wrote to the British Baha'is in these years. Sadly, by 1960 the problem of recurring ill health frequently appears. 

 For four months, March to June 1962, he was unable to meet the National Assembly as was his wont, following his resignation from this body in February 1960 in order better to contribute to the development of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause of God, one of the goals of the 

Ten Year Crusade. In August

 1962 he entered hospital for an operation on his right shoulder, and from 1963 he had to contend repeatedly with various kinds of illness and injury which greatly taxed his strength. Yet some of his finest contributions occurred in these years. 

 Uasan had served for twenty-seven continuous  years as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly and for seventeen years as its chairman, seven of these during the exacting  claims of the World Crusade. To the regret but with the affection and gratitude of his fellow members, 'who felt truly bereft at losing him', he had withdrawn from the Assembly, offering however to consult with them as a Hand whenever he was in if ngland. This he did when his health permitted, often discussing ten or twelve subjects at a meeting, or when absent sending his suggestions. 

 In addition, he was ever ready to guide and advise the Assembly officers between meetings.  In its 1962 report to Convention, the N.S.A. wrote that it 'has had the benefit of numerous consultations with Irlasan Baha'i and is deeply grateful to him for keeping so closely in touch with the work of the British Community'. 

 Their close association with him is also mentioned in 1964, 1966; 1967 and 1969. 

 Counsellor Betty Reed, who became National  Secretary in January 1961, has written: 'For there were two aspects of Hasan's assistance; one was his constant help to the National Assembly, and the other his invaluable guidance and advice to the Officers... He followed the work of the National Assembly carefully, and went to considerable trouble to help keep the Assembly on course. 1-Tasan had taught us to study every single word in Shoghi Effendi's letters and the National Assembly continued to give the same close attention to the letters of the Universal House of Justice, which was reflected in the Assembly's  direction of the Nine Year Plan Mrs. Reed cites, in particular, as does John Long, then Chairman of the N.S.A., Hasan's guidance during the imprisonment of Baha'is in 

Morocco, when 'the Officers

 were constantly  in touch' with him, as well as his encouragement to give priority to pioneering overseas despite needs on the Home Front, and this was done both for Europe in 1960 and Australia in 1961. And she continues, '. 

 reflections over the last thirteen years of travel in Europe have convinced me of the great


<p648>
648                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  debt the British Community owes to Hasan Baha'i. 
We came through the Six    

Year Plan, the Africa      
Campaign, the Ten Year     

 Crusade, and the Nine Year Plan in one steady, continuous upward curve, never doubting that goals set by the beloved Guardian or the Universal House of Justice could be won—  we didn't talk about the Power of Baha'u'llah, we just experienced it, thought it a natural Baha'i phenomenon, and that we had learned from Hasan.' 

 Counsellor Dorothy Ferraby, also an officer of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 for many years until she joined her husband, the Hand of the Cause John Ferraby, in Haifa in 1960, came to the same conclusion after more than a quarter of a century in joint service with Hasan: 'We worked together, he as chairman and I as secretary of the Youth Group. Later we worked together closely and harmoniously on the London Assembly and the National Assembly In all my association with him he was a tremendous support, a wise guide and counsellor about whatever we were involved  in. Nobody will ever be able to estimate how much the Faith in England owes to him.~ 

 Indeed, for many years he was 'rained under', in his own words, by the sheer volume of his correspondence, not only with institutions  of the Faith but with the many believers who turned to him whether in the pursuit of their services to Baha'u'llah, or in test, difficulty or sorrow. 

 His understanding, wise counsel and sympathy knew no bounds. 

 For most Baha their last sight of 1-lasan Baha'i was in 1963, for after the World Congress in the Royal Albert Hall he rarely went among them. 

The beloved Guardian~      

 s Crusade seemed to have taken all his strength. Few will forget his closing address in the first session of the Congress and his opening triumphant  words from the Master, 0 Baha'u'llah, What heist Thou done? 

 0 Baha'u'llah, May my life be sacrificed for Thee! In the compass of this one talk he recalled the entire history of the Faith, held out the vision of even greater crusades to come, and closed by extolling the Crusade whose victory the World Congress celebrated as most precious of all, for it was 'launched by our beloved Shoghi Effendi'. 

 1 He did, however, continue to guide the National 

Spiritual                  

  Assembly and Board members and attended two sessions 

  IV. Scholar and Writer     

  From the time of his appointment as a Hand of the Cause in October 1957 klasan had devoted himself to this high calling, bearing as well until Ridvan 1960 a great and continuous responsibility as chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly during the intensive activities  of the Ten Year Crusade. With his fellow Hands he had borne the crushing blow of the death of the Guardian, followed by the heart-numbing shock that he had left no heir. He had served for the first two years thereafter as one of the nine Custodians of the Faith at the World Centre, and had travelled to Haifa whenever the claims of his family permitted. 

 He had made other trips to Haifa to assist with the development of the International  Archives, and had attended the annual Conclaves of the Hands at Baha. He had participated as a Hand in the European 

Conferences with Board     

 members and National Spiritual Assemblies, unstintingly sharing his knowledge and wisdom and guiding, with other Hands, the proceedings of these important gatherings. 

 He had represented  the World Centre in 1961 and 1962 at the first Conventions in Ecuador, Peru, Holland  and Denmark, and had travelled across Canada especially visiting Indian Reserves. He had been present in 1963 at the first World Convention in Haifa and in London a few days later had addressed the opening session of the World Congress. He had continued to pour out his love and guidance to the British Baha'i Community and had consulted frequently  with their 

National Assembly.         

 But these six crowded years had taken their toll. 

 Exhausted, beset by dire financial problems,  suffering almost continuous physical pain and mental and spiritual stress, always sensitive to the sufferings of others and to negative influences affecting the Faith, he could no longer endure the problems with which, as a Hand of the Cause, he was perpetually assailed. His oniy recourse in the period following the World Congress was to close the door on such problems, attend no more gatherings whether in Britain, Europe or Haifa, leave his letters unanswered and at times unopened, and receive but few of those who sought to meet him.1 Such a drastic of the European Conference of the Hands with their Boards in London, June 1964.


<p649>
IN MEMORIAM                649

  course, although any other was beyond his strength, filled his mind with forebodings of guilt for his wasted days and abdication of his responsibilities as a Hand. Yet, all unrecognized, another path was about to open before him, another way of service as a Hand which the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha had delineated: 'to promote learning As long ago as June 1938 his short biography  of Baha'u'llah had been published, attracting the attention of Shoghi Effendi who expressed his hope 'that the two companion essays on the Rib and the Master will be soon completed , as he feels they can be of a valuable help to the friends in their teaching work'. (Unfolding Destiny, p. 122) Hasan has described how he 'set about organizing an outline for a book on the life of 'Abdu'l-Baha' and why this project was halted and 'not resumed until more than a score of years had passed'. 

 (Foreword to 'Abdu'l-Baha) It was in 1960 that he took up this work again with the idea of a trilogy on the three Central Figures of the Faith. His original booklet, surely a literary gem, was amplified with an invaluable essay on the 

Manifestations of God     

 and published at Ridvan 1963 as Baha'u'llah, the first of his trilogy. 

 Perforce the project had suffered postponement in those overburdened years as the World Crusade drew to a close, and even after the Crusade had ended and his yearning to write his biography of the Master filled him with a kind of desperation, it was not until 1965 that he turned his full attention to writing. 

 His last decade would see the publication of five major literary works in English and he would leave as well several manuscripts for posthumous publication. 

 He had found at last, after those testing months when he felt himself burned out and impotent, yet never yielding his trust in Baha'u'llah's merby and succour, a career for which all his study, experience and devotion  had prepared him. From 1965 onwards his labours were ceaseless and his achievements enriched the literature of the Faith, inspired youthful Baha scholars, and increased  the knowledge of all who turned to his books. 

 Although he lived with pain to the end —  angina, hiatus hernia and high blood pressure in his last five years — ill health endowed him with the need for retirement from public activities and gave him the privacy a writer requires. 

 In 1971 and 1973, upon receiving signed copies of 'Abdu'l-Baha and The Bab, respectively, the Universal House of Justice addressed to Hasan two letters in which he 'took great pleasure', being 'enormously grateful' for their support and encouragement.  (Molly Baha'i through theft son Robert) 'Your book is a splendid addition to the literature of the Cause', they wrote, 'and eloquent testimony to your wisdom in concentrating  on such scholarly activity.' 

(5 December  1971) And   

 later, 'We sincerely hope that nothing will prevent you from continuing your invaluable and devoted labours, whose results are of such infinite value in increasing the knowledge and deepening the understanding of the believers.' (22 April 1973) Hasan has stated that the delay in completing the trilogy was the result of his strong conviction 

'that Professor Edward    

 Granville Browne's connections with the Faith of the 13Th and Baha'u'llah had to be explored and explained'. 

 His first conception was to include this in his life of 'Abdu'l-Baha, but realizing 'that a diversion of that magnitude was inappropriate' he prepared this material for separate publication, rewriting it three times, and it was published in 1970. 

 The importance of this scholarly work, proving its value from the first, may well be fully recognized only in future, for, in the words of the Universal House of Justice, it 'will surely go a long way to fulfil the beloved Guardian's expressed wish that the mind of the intellectual world be freed of these wrong conceptions"'. (8 October 1969) In 1977 Hasan completed a Persian manuscript on the same theme, of greater length, quoting the text of the Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and copied in his own handwriting. 

 (Its publication has been postponed  because of recent events in irdn.) 

 Hasan's method of writing, he has said, was to work on two or three books at the same time, thereby relieving the fatigue of long hours of concentration on a single manuscript. Often it was his habit to continue far into the night, and so he would turn for refreshment from writing, to research, to reading for background. It is probable that his mind dwelt on the work in hand almost constantly. He was meticulous in assembling his materials, was known to spend three days in the deter


<p650>
650                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  mination of a single date, and gave most careful thought to the transliteration of Persian,  Arabic and Turkish names whose pronunciation could vary according to region. All his books were submitted in his own handwriting,  and even quotations were copied by hand to ensure that his choice of deletions would be followed. 

 From the very beginning he had the invaluable assistance of his cousin, 

Abu'1-Q~isim Afn4n, Custodian

 of the House of the Bab, whose 'very generous aid in my research' Hasan acknowledged in his book on E. G. Browne. 

 His diligence in obtaining and delivering  materials to Ilasan for each of his books is beyond all praise, as illustrated by this extract from a 1974 letter from Hasan: 'Afntn has brought me masses of photostats and original documents there is enough material to make the book on the Bab double its present size, and for a massive book on the Life of Baha'u'llah.' 

 In his later years it was Hasan's dream to have a research assistant, one who could spend part of each day with him. 

 This was not to be, but instead from 1972 a young scholar and medical student, Moojan Momen, served him with great devotion in such time as he could spare. His 'assiduous and able research' was acknowledged by Hasan with profound gratitude in his preface to Baha'u'llah, The King of Glory; his 'help and assistance to me have been of inestimable value'. By appointing him one of his three Literary Executors and Trustees of the AfnAn Library, Ilasan demonstrated his confidence in Dr. 

Momen.                    

 Hasan's knowledge of the Faith, of Persian history, literature and culture, of nineteenth-and  twentieth-century frTh and its leading figures, and of current developments in the world, whether political, artistic or literary, was remarkable. 

 Here are a few passages from a letter from Dr. Iraj Ayman: although 'not personally known to the rank and file of the friends in Iran Ihe] was much better known and respected amongst upper class intelligentsia, especially scholars and intellectuals  either educated in England or engaged in Iranian studies. 

 He was regarded as an authority a leading scholar Sitting in London be was more informed and well-versed in Persian studies than any other scholar I knew His fluency in Persian, 

English, Arabic and French

 as well as familiarity with some other languages had made him unique amongst orientalists If he is not yet openly acknowledged as a leading figure in contemporary Persian literature it is only because he was a wellknown and active Baha'i. .' Even while engaged in his English writing, three of his books in Persian were published in IrAn: The Story of Three Sisters (the 

Brontes), Half-Brothers   

 (a collection of short stories translated from English), and Words in English Derived from Persian, in which 'he traced the roots of more than seven hundred English words'. (Iraj Ayman; titles translated by Mr. 

Baha'i)                  

 'You know better than I', wrote Farhang Afflan, 'what an encyclopaedic mind he had •Whatever statement he made, he could substantiate it by not one but several independent  and reputable sources.' And the Hand of the Cause A.-A. Fur6tan has said, 'Even when I met him in London at the end of his life, he was speaking of Iranians who were writing against the Faith, and I saw how wide was his knowledge of books published. But he made no mention of his own writings — so humble, modest and brilliant he was.' 

 Some have wondered why, after his trilogy was completed in 1973 and despite his plan for four volumes presenting the life and times of Baha'u'llah in their historical setting both in frhn and in the world at large, he should first write a volume entitled Muhammad and the Course of Isldm (1976). The closing paragraph of this book shows how essential it was as a bridge to the 'vast study' he was contemplating.  More than this, an understanding of Jshm based on full recognition of 'the God-given mission of Mul2ammad' and free of sectarian bias, he felt to be an essential background for study of the Baha'i Faith. 

 And so he 'produced a monumental work on Jshm which will eclipse most of the books written on this subject' (Professor Zeine N. Zeine) —  a subject which has never really received from western scholars and writers the objective and accurate treatment it deserves'. (The Hand of the Cause Abu'1-QAsim 

Faizi)                    

 In the spring of 1979, when Hasan was striving to complete the first volume of his ambitious project, he said to a visitor, 'I hope that I will live long enough to finish it.' (0. Z. Whitehead) It had been a daunting under


<p651>
IN MEMORIAM                651

  taking during the previous four years as his materials accumulated and he laboured with utmost care to bring into being this great and unique work. No other comprehensive biography of Baha'u'llah, whether in English or Persian, has so far been achieved. 

 The writer recalls the enthusiastic comment of the Hand of the Cause Paul Haney in April 1980, on reading the published 

Baha'u'llah, The King      

 of Glory: It's 'great, really great There will never be anything like it.' To study the work of Flasan Baha'i is to realize his central motivation: to promote the highest interests of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, and to do so with truth and dignity in a manner befitting its indescribably high station. That he did not complete all he had in mind is a loss for which we have no compensation. 

 But, in the words of the Hand of the Cause Dr. Ugo Giachery, his 'gemlike books will remain among the most outstanding writings to enlighten the paths of seekers for centuries to come'. 

 A year after Hasan's passing, a brief but moving essay by him entitled Khadijih Ba gum, The Wife of the Bab, was published to commemorate this first anniversary, and in a foreword his son Robert described 'his legacy to the Baha'i World', his own books and documents as the nucleus of the Afn6n Library which, when established, should be open to all students and scholars wishing to research the history of the Faith'. It was 'his most dear wish: that his work should continue and that the study of the history of the Faith should grow to its recognition as a major scholastic discipline'. Already this hope has been recognized in the Hasan Baha'i Lectureship  founded in 1980 by the Canadian Association for Baha'i Studies, for which distinguished Baha'is have addressed the Annual Conferences of the past four years. 

 During the last months of Hasan's life, following a time in hospital in October 1979 after a heart attack, he seemed to become the Ilasan we remembered, frail but as one rejuvenated. 

 He had already written the major part of the second volume of his great project and was working on the third. 

 On 4 November he had visited, after long absence, the grave of the beloved Guardian and a photograph at its gate records his happiness. On 26 November, having expressed a wish to do so, he spoke to Baha'i friends at the Tlazfratu'1-Quds on a theme close to his heart — 'The Power of the Covenant' — hoping 'to be with you more often, my great privilege'. 

 (This beautiful talk is recorded on tape.) 

 He had also conceived, with utmost longing, a plan to carry to the Threshold of the Shrine of Baha'u'llah a leather-bound copy of his labour of love and praise for the One to Whom he had dedicated his life so long before. 

 The first copy reached England early in February 1980, but instead of seeing it with his own eyes he had it delivered for this special binding. 

 He was never to see it, for on 12 February, as the result of a stroke in the morning hours, he passed away quietly in his sleep. It fell to his son Robert to complete this precious mission in March, which he performed in deep humility, and now the volume is preserved in the International Baha'i 

Archives.                  

 On 15 February in the chapel of the New Southgate Cemetery, and then beside his grave near that of his beloved Guardian, large numbers of his family and friends paid their final tribute. 'His life of service and spiritual obedience and sacrifices remains an effulgent example to emulate Dear, dear Hasan •In time, all humanity will treasure your memory.

     29 October 1979          
Rahmatu'116h Muh6jir     

 was born, in 1923, into a distinguished Baha family. Three of his forebears — the DawlatalAdi brothers —  attained the presence of Baha'u'llah and later were recipients of a Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha bearing the salutation Ay Muh4jirdn — 'O Pioneers' — in which He exhorts them to thank God that they were able to meet the Blessed Beauty and prays for their success in rendering  ever-increasing services to the Faith. 

 The name MulPjir was adopted as their family name from that day. 
      The parents of Rahmatu'I1~h

Muh6jir, Ha-fizu'11Th    

 KMn and Ismat KIPnum, continued the family tradition of dedication and service. Ralimat, his brothers and five sisters were brought up in a home that was a centre for many Baha'i meetings and firesides attended by great Baha'i teachers. Ra~mat participated in all these meetings from early childhood and brought many seekers to hear the teachings of Baha'u'llah. If by chance there was no one to accompany him he would invite the corner shopkeepers, promising them a good Persian meal. He always remembered this period of his life as a very happy one during which he received a thorough Baha training that had instilled in his heart the love of Baha'u'llah and devotion to His Faith. 

 He chose the path of service early in his life and did not deviate from it. While in high school he was a member of the local and national youth committees and spent his summers visiting all the Baha'i holy places in fr6n. 

 His first experience of pioneering came following his graduation from high school when he postponed going to university and went to the province of AdhirbAyj6n for two years. 

 His remarkable planning skills were apparent even at that early age. He organized youth and children's activities, taught adults in the evenings and prepared lessons and taught Baha'i classes. He is still remembered in that area for his kindness, love, knowledge of the Faith, humility and sense of humour. This sense of humour persisted throughout his life and was a saving grace in many difficult situations. 

 After this period of pioneering he entered medical school. His friends recall that he sustained and even increased his Baha'i activities. 

 When well-meaning friends advised him to concentrate more on his studies to avoid


<p653>
IN MEMORIAM                653

  failing, his reply was that Baha'u'llah would take care of his studies if he attended to His work. 

 To the astonishment of all, a few months before graduation from medical school he suspended his studies and devoted three months to assisting in the accomplishment of the goals of the Forty-Five Month Plan of the National Spiritual Assembly of fran. 
He was secretary of the    

National Pioneering  Committee

 and felt that it was not sufficient to do only administrative work. After the successful completion of the Plan he returned to his studies and graduated with honours from medical school. 

 We were married in 1951, just a few months prior to his graduation, and had the bounty of receiving a telegram from the beloved Guardian,  sent to my father, the Hand of the 

Cause of God 'Ali-Akbar    

 Furiitan, conveying good wishes and saying 'praying blessings'. 

 In 1952 when the Ten Year World Crusade of the Guardian had been announced, it was our privilege to go on pilgrimage. Rahmat had the blessing on several occasions of being alone with the Guardian who spoke to him about the Pacific Islands, the Malaysian Peninsula  and the great potential of that part of the world. 

 Pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines and meeting the Guardian of the Cause of God increased the desire for sacrifice and service in Rahmat's heart. On his return he was impatient and disinterested in his well-salaried job as a physician in the American Point Four hospital in Isfah~in. He wanted to leave everything, forget the material world and carry out the wishes of his beloved Guardian. The Guardian had asked the Baha'is to undertake the spiritual conquest of the world. Rahmat wanted to respond to this call immediately.  He felt there was no time to lose. This attitude of absolute obedience to the Guardian and being guided by his words continued throughout his life; he devoured the writings of Shoghi Effendi and tried to follow and implement all the instructions. This was the motivating force of his life. 

  At the Asian Conference    
in New Delhi in October    

1953 the National Spiritual
Assembly of Australia      

 and New Zealand announced that a physician was needed to fill their goal in the Mentawai Islands as doctors were the only ones who stood a remote chance of obtaining a visa. Rahmat volunteered without hesita tion. He resigned from his job and we sold all our worldly belongings. 

 He had no idea what sort of place Mentawai was, whether or not he could get a job and, most important of all, whether a permit to stay in Indonesia would be granted us. Rahmat was confident that by arising to carry out the behest of the Guardian all obstacles would be removed. In December 1953 we set out as pioneers to the Mentawai Islands. 

 We arrived in the Island of Muara Siberut in February 1954 and were declared 

Knights of Baha'u'llah     
by the beloved  Guardian. 

 Rabmat was employed by the Indonesian Ministry of Health, given a permanent residence visa and — miraculously — was assigned to Mentawai 

Islands.                   
 Pioneering to Mentawai     

 Islands — four small dots on the map in southern Sumatra in the Indonesian Archipelago — opened a vast and exciting field of service to Rahmat. Although coming from a very different background and culture he felt very much at home in this new environment. 

 He was joyful and constantly gave thanks to the beloved Guardian for this great opportunity and prayed to Baha'u'llah, day and night, not to take it away from him. 

 Muara Siberut is a former Dutch penal colony. Distant from the mainland, with no kind of development or comfort, and a constant climate of forty degrees Celsius, it was not a priority in the minds of the government officials. 

 The native inhabitants were left to themselves, had no medical care, and practically all suffered from malaria and severe tropical skin diseases. Rahmat, whose field of work was preventive medicine, began a systematic method of eradication of malaria and other diseases. 

 He not only taught the people the Faith but also helped them to better their physical life, lie respected the people of Mentawai and did not try to change their customs or their manner of dress. 

 He had come to bring them a spiritual message and their appearance made no difference to him. 

 He loved the tattooed natives as though they were his nearest and dearest kin. He never interfered with any of their traditional practices, especially if they did not affect their health. 

 He very often participated in the native healer's dances and ceremonies, and allowed them to apply ritual paint to his face before examining a patient. 

 He taught them how to use soap when they bathed in the river,


<p654>
654                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  how to clean their hair, and how to take care of their babies. This genuine affection was reciprocated by the natives; they sought his advice and guidance in every matter. 

 As the number of Baha'is increased Rah-mat  helped them to move their villages to new sites and gave them plans which included a Baha'i Centre and a 

Baha'i Cemetery. Separate 

 shelters were built for their livestock which up to that time had shared their dwellings. The natives supplied the wood and roof thatching and Rahmat gave them nails and assisted the many Baha'i villages in the actual building of their houses. Perhaps the most important indication of the complete acceptance of Baha'u'llah by the natives of Mentawai was their willingness to depart from their ancestral burial ritual. It involved leaving  the unburied corpse exposed until it decomposed and hanging the bare bones in their homes. After becoming Baha'is they buried their dead according to Baha laws. 

 In all the years of his work in Mentawai, Rabmat had very cordial relations with the Christian missionaries. 

 Although very often they opposed him and disrupted his work, he was always kind to them, attended to their needs when they were sick, showed them every courtesy and did nothing to undermine the faith of those they had converted to Christianity. The natives, whether Christian, Baha'i or pagan, adored him. 

 Once when the Governor of Sumatra visited the islands to inspect Rahmat's work many of the natives greeted him with shouis of Alldh-u-Abhd. When asked what this meant they referred him to Rahmat saying, 'We are what the doctor is.' This resulted in a lengthy fireside with the Governor and other officials. The Governor was very impressed and for the duration of his term in office stayed on friendly terms with 

Ra1~mat.                   

 Although Ra4mat did not consider it so, all this was achieved with a great deal of physical hardship. 

 Often when returning from his frequent trips to the remote interior, trips involving  many days of walking through jungles and in waist-deep water, he would enter the wooden hut with tree bark walls that served as our home, covered in mud and blood from the leeches that had attached themselves to him while he walked in the rivers, happy and elated because a few people in the village he had visited had accepted the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 He dismissed the leeches and the blood, saying God was helping him not to have high blood pressure. 

 We were both afflicted with the severest kind of tiopical malaria a few weeks after our arrival in the islands. In Ralimat's case it was much more difficult as the shivers and very high fever came to him while he was walking in mud and torrential tropical rains and sleeping on a mat on the damp ground in the jungles. 

 The only means of communication with the outside world was a government mail-boat which visited Mentawai every six to eight months. When the mail included a message from the Guardian Rakimat's spirit soared and his soul became aflame. These letters and messages sustained him for the next eight months. 

 Illness, lack of food and exhaustion did not matter, as long as the Guardian was pleased. 

 The numerous letters and cables addressed by Shoghi Effendi to Rahmat were left in Mentawai. The following extracts are quoted from the many letters of Dr. Hakim, the Persian secretary to the Guardian, which convey the Guardian's happiness with Rah-mat's efforts in the Mentawai 

Islands:                   
    18 July 1955: 'Assure      

 Dr. Mirza and his wife that he prays for them and the success of their services to the Faith. 

 The outstanding services that he and his wife have rendered have brought much happiness to his heart.' 

 18 May 1956: 'He said to convey his profound appreciation to Dr. Muhajir, who is a true pioneer,. 

 and also to his wife He is very happy with Dr. MulAjir and his wife.' 

 Ralimat was appointed to the rank of Hand of the Cause of God amongst the last contingent, in October 1957. The telegram of the beloved Guardian arrived when he was away in the villages of Java on a teaching trip. We had undertaken this rare trip to Djakarta on the instruction of the beloved Guardian to Ral)mat to assist in the purchase of the National 

Haziratu'1-Quds.           

 Raljmat's great desire had been to remain in his pioneering post for the rest of his life. The sudden passing of the beloved Guardian a few weeks after the appointment of the last contingent of the Hands of the Cause made


<p655>
IN MEMORIAM                655

  this resolve even stronger. 

 However, it was necessary for him to leave the islands. The affairs of the Faith were at a crucial point. The Ten Year Crusade was at its midway point and all the Hands of the Cause had to be involved in t1~e worldwide development of the Faith. It was not possible for one of them to be incommunicado in a place that had no telegram or telephone service and was cut off from the rest of the world except by means of a boat which most of the time was out of service. It took months of persuasion by the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land, and lengthy nights and days of prayer, before Rabmat, sadly and reluctantly, left the people he had loved so much and served so well. 
     We left Mentawai in 1958. 

 In the four years of his work in the islands the number of Baha'is had increased to more than four thousand, three of the thirty-three 

Local Spiritual Assemblies

 had been incorporated, Baha'i schools had been established, a Baha'i endowment land had been purchased which was one of eight in the Baha world, and a Baha'i pamphlet had been translated and printed in the Mentawaf language. This was a historic achievement as Mentawai was a spoken language that had never been recorded. 

 Rahmat always believed that entire vii-lages should be brought to the Faith as this prevented disunity and friction amongst the people and allowed them to progress much more in following the principles of the Faith. lie put this idea into practice in Mentawai. 

 He worked for the village as a whole and directed all aspects of the villagers' Lives according to the teachings. Many of the children who sat at his feet on the damp ground learning Baha'i prayers and the alphabet by the light of a small candle and sometimes the glow of the moon went on to live at the Baha'i dormitory in Sumatra which Rahmat had initiated and some became doctors and engineers. They remember him with love and affection and say they owe all to this gentle and kind man who sat them on his knees and chanted prayers and songs in his melodious voice. 

 A WHO Committee which visited Menta-wai  in 1960, in its report, after giving details of the beliefs of the J3ahd'f Faith, devotes two long pages to Rahmat's medical work in the islands and adds that he was the oniy representative among those of different religions who was concerned with the development  of the islands, establishing schools, eradicating disease and bringing cleanliness and order to the villages. 

 Leaving Mentawal closed a phase of distinguished service in Ralimat's life and opened a new one which continued for the next twenty years of his life. These twenty years are so entwined with the history of mass teaching and the development of the Faith, and his travels around the world are so extensive, that it is not possible to record all the events in the scope of this article. In the years between 1958 and 1979 he visited all the Baha'i National Centres several times and in each country travelled to the interior visiting mass teaching areas and isolated believers. 

 In the first three years of the Five Year Plan he had visited more than fifty countries. He travelled by sea and air, in buses and bullock carts, on foot and by hitchhiking. On one occasion he went from Afghanistan to fr4n by oil tanker, and once, in order to visit a remote Pacific island, he signed on an oil tanker as a ship's doctor for two weeks. He told me later that he was seasick during that whole journey. 

 He used utmost economy in all his travels, choosing the routes that would give him the most mileage on a plane ticket. He stayed at moderately priced hotels, in less expensive rooms, and chose meals that would not cost much. He very rarely went sightseeing. 

 To him, all cities and countries were the same. 

 It was the quality of the teaching activities that made them different. 

 Rahmat's extraordinary quality of recognizing the needs of an area made his advice valuable and practical. His vast experience and continuous travels enabled him to participate  and contribute many ideas towards the formulation of the various plans of the World Centre. 

 Cooperation between two neighbouring countries and the development of Baha villages were ideas that were first introduced by him in Indonesia. 

 lie Later implemented these ideas in the Philippines, Laos, Hong Kong, Korea, India and many countries of 

Africa and South America. 

 He had the courage to advance suggestions and a talent for creating enthusiasm in those who would implement them. 

 He had utter reliance on and submission to the will of God; hence


<p656>
656                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  he was never discouraged. 

 He offered his proposals selflessly with love and humility and did not insist on their acceptance. 

 Each new plan was an exciting challenge. He never tired of discussing the goals with the friends. Many of us looked on the formation of a new Assembly as a routine task, whether it was a goal of the Nine Year Plan or the Seven Year Plan. Not Rahmat. Forming a new Assembly in 1979 was more exciting than the one formed in 1975. 

 His perception and deep interest in all areas of teaching, consolidation and proclamation of the Faith might be best illustrated by his work in the Philippines and India. Mass teaching in the Philippines started in 1960 when, accompanied by pioneers, he went to many villages and tribal areas. He cared for and nourished the new Baha'is of the Philippines  with such love and understanding that it was as if the Philippines was the only country on his itinerary. 

 Lie helped them with every aspect of their growth. He suggested books for translation into local languages, found the translators, selected a publisher, and even chose the paper and bargained for the price. I-Ic visited the new Baha'is and later the Local Assemblies over and over again, attended the first National Convention, spoke at universities and colleges, bought books on student exchange and presented them to the 

National Assembly. He     

 later encouraged many Iranian Baha'i students to enrol in the excellent universities in the Philippines-As s the community grew in numbers and strength he called on the Baha'is to pioneer and took many of them with him and helped them to settle in Hong Kong, Laos, Malaya and many countries of 

Africa.                   

 Ralimat had travelled to India many times, encouraging the friends to realize that the time had come for entry by troops in that vast subcontinent. 

 His visit in 1961 was endowed with the blessing of the start of mass teaching. 

 A report by Mr. Ilushmand Fatheazam published in the October 1961 issue of Ba/nfl News of U.S.A. describes the arrival in Bombay of 'the revered Hand of the Cause Dr. Muhdjir, whose encouragement and guidance  had previously made the National Spiritual Assembly lay stress on the importance of teaching the masses'. Learning of his desire to hold a conference for the masses, word was sent to the Spiritual 

Assembly of Samagiman-da  

 and a conference was arranged there within forty-eight hours. In spite of severe cold the conference drew more than three hundred people and lasted until well past midnight. 'A group of Baha, organized by Dr. MuhAjir, was. dispatched to various villages. 

 So, from the beginning of February a process of chain reaction has set in. Every few days a conference would be organized. The result of each conference would be between one hundred and two hundred declarations.' 

 Thus the process of entry by troops in India had started. In 1961 there were 850 Baha and in 1963, 65,000. 

 Ralimat's proposals as reported in the November 1979 issue of Baha'i' News included acquisition of village T-lazfratu'bQuds, establishment  of schools for education of children. Many Hazfratu'1-Quds were purchased and the village schools led to the establishment of the Rabbani school, the site of which was bought with Rahmat's help. He urged, from the earliest days, the establishment of an education fund. 

 This fund is now in operation. On his return to India later in 1961 he foresaw the need for continuous deepening and began immediately to look for a suitable building to house a teaching institute. Eventually he found the building that was purchased and is now the Faizi Institute near Indore. 

 In 1967 he brought the first pioneers from Malaysia to India; the following years he began the flow of student pioneers from fAn. Also in 1967 he proposed the convening of a press seminar and conference for newspaper editors, helped to arrange it and prepare the materials and handouts, and attended the seminar which was very successful. 
     At the time of the first  

West Asia Youth Conference

 in 1971, he arrived a few days earlier and asked the youth to disperse to colleges and universities and proclaim and teach the Faith. In three days the number of new believers reached seven hundred. 

 He encouraged the Baha'i Publishing Trust to publish Baha'i books in all Indian and other languages and disseminate low-priced books to the other mass teaching areas. Under his constant guidance the Publishing Trust of India grew into a giant enterprise which sent thousands of books to the rest of the world. 

 He conceived the idea of a simple 'infor


<p657>
IN MEMORIAM               657

  mation folder', hundreds of thousands of copies of which are in use all over the world. The folder is still an important tool of proclamation. 

 He proposed and helped prepare  a Baha correspondence course which was used very successfully in 

India, the Philippines    

 and other mass teaching countries. He wrote a book on methods of Baha education of children which is now being translated into English. These examples demonstrate that although remembered specifically for his devotion  to mass teaching, he directed his energies towards all strata of society, and all the goals of various plans were of equal importance to him. 

 He appeared many times on television, gave radio broadcasts, had an audience with His Highness Malietoa 

Tanumafili II of Western  

 Samoa, had interviews with many presidents, prime ministers, ministers and mayors in many of the countries that he visited. He gave talks in universities and at conferences in Europe and the United States, as well as talks in small villages. In addition to representing the Universal House of Justice at the inaugural  conventions of many national communities he participated in teaching conferences, Summer  Schools and local events all over the Baha'i world. 

 To teach while sitting on the floor of a small hut in Korea in sub-zero temperature was of the same importance to him as standing at the podium of a wellknown university in the United States. 

 His belief was that humanity was athirst for the teachings of Baha'u'llah and that the Baha'is of the world had the capability of bringing millions to the Faith. 

 He very often chanted the Tablet of Visitation of 'Abdu'l-Baha before going to any meeting and was convinced that the power of prayer would overcome all incapacities. Prayer was the core of his life. 

 Very many nights he would spend in prayer till dawn for various projects in the Baha'i world. 

 He saw the Baha'i world as one unit created by the Guardian through the Ten Year Crusade, and he believed that entry by troops should not be confined to the less developed countries of the globe. 

 On numerous occasions he brought to the United States and Europe teaching materials  used in India and South America, and urged the friends to use them. 

 When they did, great results were achieved. 

 To give a glimpse of the effect on others of his services to the Faith I have selected the following passages from the countless letters and reports that make reference to him: 'He arranged the plans and bade us farewell. 

 We are rich in the heritage of these visits The fruits of his trips will continue to develop in the years to come.' 

Papua and New Guinea       

 'His mind was so keen, so alert, and he spoke quietly his ideas were positive, progressive [soj that sometimes [they] 
pressed our imagination.'  

Guam                       

 'The most striking aspect of Dr. Muh~jir's personality seemed to be the rapidity with which he adapted his plans to a given situation and his humbleness when submitting these suggestions to the National Spiritual Assembly  and then ittiring.' 

Luxembourg                 

 'Every time he met with our National Spiritual Assembly he had a different kind of theme. All revolved around teaching, but approaches were different. He had great humility and yet had the power to change individuals.' 

Japan                      

 'He didn't ever seem angry when something  was not possible. He had a strange acquiescence with obstacles.' Switzerland 'The insight and the depth of devotion which characterized his selfless example will continue to give impetus and commitment to the work the vibrating influence of this champion teacher will reach beyond the imaginings of his admirers.' Gambia 'His devotion to the Cause, the encouragement  he gave to so many Baha'i communities, the seemingly endless energy he expended in carrying out his work and the uncounted other qualities he possessed combined themselves in a unique and mighty warrior of 

Baha'u'llah.'              

 U.S.A. 'It is difficult to attempt to convey the depth and magnitude of the services which Dr. Muh6jir rendered in bringing into existence this fledgling pillar of the 

Universal House of Justice.

 When he first came to the Philippines we had four Local Spiritual 

Assemblies and a Baha'i    
population of two hundred. 

 Twenty years later, after two decades of showering his love and guidance upon us, there were forty-five 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 
and 64,000 believers.'     

Philippines                

 'Dr. Mirza is the oniy Hand of the Cause

  ever to visit the interior of the country. His love for the indigenous people initiated teaching  which has resulted in over half of the believers in Paraguay.' Paraguay 'One of our goals was the acquisition of a National llazfratu'1-Quds we had found four houses for sale. Dr. Muh6jir asked us to show him these houses. 

 When we reached the third one, the present National Hazfratu'1-Owls,  he immediately said, "This is it. I will pray that Baha'u'llah will assist you to acquire this property." He got out of the car and chanted prayers for some time. 

 We did not even look at the fourth building. 

Of course Dr. MuMjir's    
prayers were answered.'   

Central  African Republic

 In all his life he never considered himself a worthy servant of Baha'u'llah. 

 He prayed constantly and beseeched God's forgiveness and asked Him to assist him to overcome tests and tribulations. He sacrificed his all without thinking of it as a sacrifice. 

 Whenever he had to leave our daughter, Gisu, who was born in 1961 in Germany while Rabmat was teaching in South America, he said it was as if a thorn went through his heart, yet he accepted the separation with submission and prayer. 

 He never complained about the hardships of his travels. 

 He sought service to the Faith with eagerness and embraced adversity in the path of God as a great reward. 

 This verse from a prayer by 'Abdu'l-Baha which Ral)mat chanted every day exemplifies his consuming desire to serve Baha'u'llah to the end of his days: Shelter under Thy protection, 0 Thou spirit of purity, Thou who art the Alt-Bountiful Provider, this enthralled, enkindled servant of Thine. Aid him in this world of being to remain steadfast and firm in Thy love and grant that this broken-winged bird. 

 may attain a refuge and shelter in Thy Divine Nest, that abideth upon the Celestial Tree. 

 His death came-in  the way he had always wanted, while serving the Faith, remote from home but amongst the BaWi'i friends. Despite extreme fatigue he had travelled to Quito, Ecuador, to participate in a special .teach-ing  conference arranged by the Continental Board of Counsellors in South America. On the second day of the conference he suffered a heart attack. 

 Counsellor Ma'siid Khamsi, a close friend since the days of his youth who had shared many of the joys and hardships of his travels in South America, was with him until he came to his final rest. 

 Rahmat's last words were lid Bahd'ul-Abhd and he was holding clutched in his right hand a silk purse containing a few strands of 'Abdu'l-Baha's precious hair which he had carried near his heart for more than twenty years. 

 Quito, that jewel-like white city, set high in the Andes, with its towering green mountains, breathtaking valleys and radiant indigenous population, was one of Rabmat's most loved cities. Ecuador, with its gtmosphere pulsating with the power of the Words of Baha'u'llah, its masses responding in thousands to the call of the Faith of God, was an appropriate spot to embrace the earthly remains of one who had lived and died for the purpose of awakening the masses of humanity to the message of Baha'u'llah. 

 His love and affection for the people of that land was deep and selfless. Baha'is of Ecuador felt this love and returned it in full measure by assisting him in his teaching work and continuing to carry out many of his suggested projects after his passing. 

 Their mourning at losing this dear and trusted friend was genuine and their grief profound. 

 When Gisu and I arrived in Quito for Rahmat's funeral, we found gathered around his casket many friends in their colourful native clothing, men and women, praying and keeping an allnight vigil according  to their custom. They had taken him to their hearts and considered him one of their own. 

 Rahmat was a gentle, courageous, unassuming  and kind man who served the Faith of Baha'u'llah with humility, self-sacrifice and absolute devotion, He was always ahead of his time, urging the friends toward a vision destined for them by the beloved Guardian. Those who knew him realized he could not stop; he was driven to fulfil his mission to the Faith until, like a meteor in flight, he burnt away his earthly frame on the southern horizon. 

 He wore the spiritual mantle of a Hand of the Cause with dignity and humility and was a true example of the Words of 'Abdu'l-Baha alP: The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the character of all men and to be, at all times and under

  As the news spread, thousands of Faizi's lovers wept in every part of the world. They had lost a selfless friend who had showered upon them the tokens of his boundless love through his visits to their homes in far-off corners of the earth, through the numerous little gifts he sent them, and through his 

    Abu'l-Qdsim Faizi          

  wonderful, encouraging letters which uplifted their spirits, sustained them in times of sorrow, and enkindled in their hearts the longing to arise to greater heights in the service of the Cause of God. 

 Among the hundreds of messages of grief which reached the World Centre of the Baha'i Faith, there was one which expressed the feelings of all. 

 It came from a fellow Hand who was closely associated with Faizi for many years, and it said,'. A special sweetness has gone out of the world and out of my heart. 

 How can one write an adequate tribute to a man who, for over half a century, brought happiness and inspiration to all who crossed his path in life? 

 How can one tell of the influence of his spirit on the countless children he held in his arms, the numberless young people whose talents he helped to develop, and the old men and women he visited with reverence and gratitude for what they had given to the world? 

 Faizi, as he wished to be called, did not like the celebration of birthdays, except those of the Manifestations of God, and did not know the exact date of his own birth which was


<p660>
660                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  probably in 1906. Of his early days in the city of Qum he always spoke with a touch of sadness, for he was surrounded by fanatical people. One of the few happy memories of his childhood was the local gymnasium — the zar-khdnih  — a traditional Persian establishment which is not only for the purpose of physical training, but also for inculcating human virtues  such as chivalry, modesty and chastity in those who must bow in humility as they enter through its low door. Many fervent Muslims frowned upon the zcir-khdnih and Faizi had to sneak away from home to watch the pah-lavdns perform their feats of wrestling and weightlifting to the beat of the leader's drum. The leader of the zar-kh6nih a man of dignity and great moral as well as physical stature, befriended Faizi and left a permanent mark on his character. 

 After a short period of rudimentary studies in Qum, Paizi moved with his parents to Tihr6n. 

 The atmosphere of his life completely changed, as though he had come out of a stifling room into fresh air. His father, who was a Baha'i at heart, allowed him to go to the Tarbiyat School — one of many schools started by 

Baha'is throughout IrAn.   

 Here he excelled in studies and in sports. Faizi often spoke with deep love and reverence about his devoted, self-sacrificing teachers in the Tarbi-yat School, such as the great poet 'Azizu'lhh MislAh and the learned FThil-i-Shfr6zi who influenced him beyond measure and showed him the path of true servitude. 

 His fellow students, many of whom became lifelong friends, loved and respected him. It was a joy to be present at Faizi's reunion with a fellow student years later. They still spoke with awe about those wonderful teachers they had had; they remembered their classmates with affection; and how they laughed over old jokes! 

 One Friday, not long after Faizi had joined the Tarbiyat School, his Baha'i classmates took him to their 'character training class'. He always remembered that day and the kind, radiant teacher to whom he was immediately drawn — Nfiri'd-Dfn Fath-i-A'zam. He began to attend these Friday classes regularly but did not at first realize their connection with the Baha'i 

Faith. Although Faizi      

 had never known Baha'is before coming to Tihr~n, he was attracted to his Baha classmates and his acceptance of the Faith was quite natural as though he had been a believer all his life. When his mother realized her son was a Baha'i, far from showing antagonism towards the Faith, as the rest of her relatives did, she encouraged him to observe the rules which his new beliefs prescribed. A devout Muslim herself, she would rise at dawn during the Baha'i month of fasting to prepare his breakfast  and make sure that he woke up on time. She was later to know that her only other child, dder than Faizi and already married, had also accepted the Faith in another part of IrAn. 

 This sainfly lady became a firm Baha'i many years later. 

 In those days the Tarbiyat School taught only up to the ninth standard. 

 After completing  the school Faizi spent some time at the American College in Tihr4n before going on to Beirut, in Lebanon, for higher studies in 1927. 

 Beirut was only four hours away by car from Haifa and Faizi came on pilgrimage shortly after he left fr&n. The climax of his life was the moment he met the Guardian of the Cause of God at whose feet he laid his whole heart — instantly, completely and forever. 

 From that moment to the end of his days, Faizi had but one desire — to serve the Guardian. He became selfless in this servitude and sought no name or distinction. 

 His tender love for the Guardian was the cause of his happiness, and his solace in times of sorrow. This great love, the source of his own inspiration,  overflowed to fill other souls and set them, too, on the path of service. 

 The Baha'i students in Beirut were permitted to come on pilgrimage and visit the Guardian during their Christmas or Easter holidays. Faizi came whenever possible and stayed as long as he could. It was the Guardian who nurtured the seed of faith in his heart until it became a mighty tree and bore choice fruit for all to share. 

 During his visits to Haifa, Faizi was usually accompanied by his close friend and fellow student at the American University of 

Beirut                     

 — Hasan Baha'i. Faizi, always humble and faithful towards his friends, said he owed a great debt of gratitude to Baha'i, who guided him through those turbulent years and set an example for him to follow. The two were kindred souls and stood out as shining stars among the rest of the students from Iran.


<p661>
IN MEMORIAM                661

  They had similar tastes, were both attracted to literature and the arts and sometimes worked together writing and producing plays for the Persian students' society in Beirut. They also took part in all Baha'i activities, including a study class on the Faith organized by the students themselves. 

 The Guardian showered his favours on them when they came on pilgrimage and encouraged them in every way. Once he gave the two young men something to translate for him. 

 At another time he sent them to visit the Mansion of Baha'u'llah in Baha when it was still occupied by the Covenant-breakers and no other Baha'is were permitted to go there. Faizi would recount the terrible state in which they found the rooms where Baha'u'llah had once lived. Having witnessed how the enemies of the Cause had ruined the beautiful Mansion, the two friends were sent there again after the Guardian had renovated the building and furnished the rooms, restoring the dignity of the dwelling place of God's Manifestation on earth. Baha'i and Faizi were the first Baha'is allowed to sleep in the Mansion after its restoration. 

 Another great honour was bestowed upon them and a few of their fellow students when they were invited to visit the daughter of Baha'u'llah, the Greatest Holy Leaf. 

 Faizi has written about this unique privilege and the extraordinary effect that her celestial presence had on his sensitive soul. 

 Faizi had decided to go back to serve in the Tarbfyat School after finishing his studies in Beirut, and he was greatly encouraged by the Guardian's expressed hopes that Baha youth consecrate their lives to the service of the Cause. The Guardian once asked him what he intended to do after his studies were completed, and expressed great satisfaction with his decision. At another time the Guardian enquired of him whether the Baha'i schools in I r~n were closed for the nine Holy Days. Faizi replied that he did not think they were, and the Guardian said they should not open on Baha'i Holy Days even if this meant they would be permanently closed by the government.  The words of the Guardian were significant, though Faizi did not realize their full import at that time. 

 On his last visit to the Holy Land the Guardian gave Faizi flowers from the Shrines to place on his behalf on the resting-place of the first American Baha'i martyr, Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehier, who had passed away in IsfahAn. 

 The final parting with the Guardian, in 1933, would have been impossible for Faizi to bear had it not been for his great longing to start his work at the Tarbfyat School. Alas, he did not know that in 1934, less than three weeks before he could finish his compulsory military service in fran, all the Baha'i schools in the country would be permanently closed by the government because the National Spiritual Assembly had decided not to open them on Baha'i 

Holy Days.                

 His dream now shattered, Faizi reluctantly accepted a post with the Anglo-Iranian 

Oil Company in Tihr6n.    

 He had a good salary and prospects of climbing to the top of an important career. But his heart, was not in riches and high positions. Though he was serving on Baha'i committees and had started deepening classes for youth, he yearned to dedicate his whole life to the service of the Cause. He remembered that the Guardian had once told him not to defile himself with this world and wondered how he could escape it. But he remembered, too, that the Guardian  had assured him of his prayers, and this was what he relied on. An opportunity came his way and he seized it with joy and determination. 

 The Baha of the village of Najaffibdd, whose schools had been closed by the government, had asked for a volunteer to go to live among them and teach their children. To the great surprise of all and the dismay of his friends, Faizi decided to give up his job and become a teacher in an obscure corner of the country. 

 This was probably the greatest decision he was to make, for it set the course of his life away from the glitter of the world. When the Guardian read about it in a general report sent to him by the National Spiritual Assembly  of fran, he wrote in reply, 'This spontaneous  decision will attract divine confirmation  and is a clear proof of the high endeavour, the pure motive, and the self-sacrifice of that favoured servant of the divine Threshold. 

 I am extremely pleased and grateful  to him and I pray from the depths of my heart for the success of that active, radiant youth.


<p662>
662                 THE BAHA'! WORLD

  In Najaf6b6d Faizi had about four hundred students, from kindergarten children to adults. He organized his classes in the homes of the Baha'is and went from house to house from morning till afternoon, sometimes starting at dawn to teach the youth who went to work in the fields after their lessons. Some of those who had previously taught in the two Baha schools in the village helped him with the children, but Faizi had introduced Baha'i lessons for all the students now that they were •not obliged to follow the strict curriculum imposed on schools by the government, so the burden of the work fell on his shoulders. 

 His mother gave him all her support. As his father had passed away while he was in Beirut, she had accompanied Faizi to Najaf6b6d, and she helped him in every way she could. She loved the children who were always in and out of their modest home. She washed the faces of the little ones and combed their hair, and associated with their parents, serving them in many ways. She also supported Faizi financially in Najaf6Md with the little money left to her by her husband, for the nominal sum he himself received served only as pocket money, which he usually spent on the children. Their household at this time included a faithful old servant, a child Faizi had adopted befoTe leaving Tihr~n, and two other children belonging to a widowed relative. 

 It was in Najaf4Md that Faizi's mother dreamed of the blessed BTh and became a firm believer. 

 It was also during this period that Faizi chose his life's partner, someone he had known for many years. 

 Faizi's daily work in the village did not end with the classes in the afternoons. 

 In the evenings, dressed in simple clothes woven and stitched in NajaffibAd, he would attend Baha'i meetings or visit the friends in their homes, inspiring them with stories from Baha'i history or sharing with them some of the rare Tablets of Baha'u'llah which he had transcribed in beautiful calligraphy. 

 He loved to sit at the feet of the older generation and hear from them about the first courageous Baha'is of NajafiMd in the days of Baha'u'llah. The lives of the early believers always fascinated him. 

 All his life he gathered these stories and recounted them to other Baha'is, touching their hearts and giving them insight into the sacrifices that had laid the foundations of their Faith. Often he would encourage a youth to serve the Cause by telling him of the great deeds of one of his own ancestors of which he himself had not known before. 

 During his stay in Najaf6b~d, Faizi's work extended to the neighbouring city of IsfaMn where he held a regular deepening class for a large number of youth, and to the surrounding villages where he visited the Baha'is from time to time. In NajafTh4d itself he h&Iped to build a strong, well-organized community with a library, which was named after Zaynu'1-Muqarrabin,  the famous religious dignitary of NajafAbTh who became a Baha'i and went to live with Baha'u'llah in exile. 

 Faizi also encouraged the Baha'is to build a public bath as none of the villagers had baths in their homes and BaTA'fs were not allowed to step inside the public bath owned by Muslims. 

 But, of course, his main work centred on the children and the youth. Years later, as he travelled around the world, he was to meet dozens of them scattered as pioneers in different countries, many with high academic degrees and important positions, but still looking up to him as their teacher and their example in life. 

 Faizi stayed in Najaf6b6d for about five years until he had trained enough teachers to carry on his work. During this time he had travelled to other parts of {r~n, meeting Baha'i communities and translating for visitors from abroad. 

 He had also translated into Persian some of the Guardian's letters to the West, and had prepared a condensation of The Dawn-Breakers. 

 On these he based his notes when teaching Baha'i administration and history at the newly-established Summer School on the outskirts of TihrAn. 

     The National Spiritual     

 Assembly asked Faizi to go from Najaf6b6d to the town of Qazvin where there was another large community of believers. In reply to the Assembly's  report, dated 1940, the Guardian wrote that they 'should constantly encourage this distinguished youth so that all his time may be spent in impoTtant service to the Cause because his services are very important and his travels to Baha'i Centres produce beneficial  results. I do not forget the ceaseless services of that active servant of the Cause in Najaf6b6d, and it is my cherished hope that he will be graciously aided to render greater

IN MEMORIAM                663

  services, accomplish more important undertakings and achieve higher and more distinguished  victories. 

 This is my earnest desire for him at all times and under all conditions In Oazvin, as in NajafAb6d, Faizi endeared himself to young and old alike. 

 His personal life, as well as his dedicated work, influenced everyone who came in touch with him. He organized Baha'i classes for all ages and took the youth on outings to visit believers in neighbouring towns and villages. He went to people's homes, taking warmth and laughter wherever he went. He encouraged the community  to closer association and helped to establish a beautiful library in the name of one of Qazvin's foremost 

Baha — Hakim-i-I1Thi. But 

 his greatest accomplishment in that town was the training of over thirty youth who studied with him every day, preparing themselves for dedicated service to the Cause. These youth became ignited torches and later carried the light of Baha'u'llah to different villages and towns, and many of them rendered  outstanding services as pioneers in other countries. Faizi's stay in Qazvin was no more than a year but the results of his work there were immeasurable. 

 When the Guardian asked the Baha'is of bAn to pioneer to the neighbouring countries, Faizi's response was immediate. In the winter of 1941 he set out with his wife for Baglidrid, hoping to obtain a visa to one of the countries in the Arabian Peninsula. He was unable to get to his pioneering post for a year, during which time he brought a new spirit to the Baha'i community in Baghd~id. He started regular study classes for their youth, encouraged  the new believers, made friends among the members of old Baha'i families from the days before Baha'u'llah's declaration,  and continued to collect his precious stories. 

 To those who, like himself, had set out to pioneer to Arabia and were stranded in Baghddd during the war — whole families with young children and elderly people living under dire conditions — he was a symbol of patience, a ray of joy with his ever-ready humour. 

 Faizi and his wife were among the very few who were able to pioneer to Arabia after the long waiting. They had, by now, exhausted what little money they had, but Faizi was offered a job in the only secondary school in Bahrain at that time. 

 Unfortunately, the job was withdrawn after it became known that he was a Baha'i, and it was oniy through a miracle that he was not deported from the island. 

 There followed test after test, too numerous to recount, but nothing could dampen  his spirit. 

His beloved Guardian      

 had asked the pioneers to remain at their posts, and neither the terrible heat, the lack of water, of proper food and every means of comfort, nor the hostility of fanatical people could shake his determination to stay in Bahrain. 

 Faizi, his wife, the two children born to them in Bahrain and one new believer were the only Baha'is in that part of the world for about seven years before a few other pioneers could settle in the countries along the coast of Arabia. 

 They were not permitted to mention the Faith and strange rumours were circulated about their beliefs. But Faizi, in his sweet, gentle manner, slowly began to win the hearts of the inhabitants of Bahrain. His students at the school had been the first to be attracted to him, then gradually the neighbours, the shopkeepers around and, finally, nearly all those who had considered him a heretic and had tried to have him deponed became his friends. 

 Faizi had a way of bringing out the good hidden in people's souls. Once he befriended a wellknown thief in Babrain who spent most of his time in prison. Whenever he met this man on the street he would do some shopping and send the purchases home with him so that he could give him a little money for his trouble. The man faithfully delivered everything.  One day Faizi entrusted him with some expensive items and, when he reached home after a long while, saw that the shopping had not yet been delivered. 

 It might have been natural to assume that this time the temptation  had proved too much for the thief, but no such doubt entered Faizi's mind. 'He has probably stopped for a chat in the market place,' he said. 'He'll come.' And he did. 

 Slowly surmounting many barriers, other pioneers — usually young men who could bear the hardships — began to settle in Arabia. They were scattered in different territories, lived under extremely difficult conditions, and could seldom receive news from their homeland.  Faizi strengthened them through his wonderful letters, uplifting their spirits, en


<p664>
664                 THE BAHA'( WORLD

  couraging them to persevere at their posts and giving them what little news he himself received. He corresponded with their parents, assuring them that their sons were safe and rendering wonderful-services s to the Cause. 

 As the number of pioneers grew in Arabia, Faizi's correspondence increased. 

 By this time he was also writing to other pioneers around the globe. He gave them news of the work in Arabia, sent them quotations from the Writings to inspire them, and anecdotes to make them laugh. To the end of his life Faizi corresponded with hundreds of friends, including  many children. 

 He loved to give people little gifts and he usually included in his letters quotations written in his own beautiful calligraphy and decorated by himself. 

 These can now be seen framed in many homes in every corner of the world. 

 Apart from his vast correspondence, Faizi wrote many articles and literary works and continued  his translations. 

 The pioneers in Arabia adored Faizi. To them he was a father and a close friend. They looked up to him as their example, and from him they learned the lessons of true love and perseverance in the face of every worldly deprivation. 

 Their only wish was to obey their beloved Guardian and cheer his heart. 

 Even when, years later, Faizi had a good job and could afford to buy a few means of comfort for his home, such as a refrigerator, he refused to do so because other pioneers in Arabia could not afford such luxury. Everything he had was shared with others. When he was asked how he would be able to pay for his children's higher education, he said, 'There are so many children around me who need help now. 

 How can I deprive them in order to save for an unknown future'?' The children he assisted at that time are now grown up and serving their countrymen through the different posts they occupy. 

 The Guardian referred to Faizi as 'the Spiritual 

Conqueror of Arabia'       

 and wrote concerning his work, 'The unceasing meritorious  services of that radiant youth in these past years illumine the annals of the Cause of God and set an example for all to follow The sacrifices of the pioneers yielded rich fruit in Arabia. Although unable to teach their Faith, they won the friendship and respect of others by their lives, thus making it possible for many Baha'is to settle throughout the 

Peninsula. Before Faizi    

 Left, in 1957, there was already a National Spiritual Assembly in Arabia, and he lived to see five others established in that area. 

 Faizi had gone to India to attend the Intercontinental Conference in 1953, and had then accompanied a Hand of the Cause to Australasia to translate-for  him. 

 He was in Europe in 1957 when news reached him that he himself had been appointed a Hand of the Cause. 

 Then, within only a few weeks, he was to receive the news which shattered his whole being. The Guardian had passed away. Grief-stricken and bowed, with uncontrollable sorrow,  he went to London to attend the funeral. Years before, the Guardian had praised his warm, resonant voice when he had chanted one of the 

Tablets of Baha'u'llah     

 for him in Haifa. It was now his destiny to chant the Prayer for the Dead before the Guardian's remains were laid to rest. 

 Faizi had no desire to live after his beloved had left this world. The only thing which kept him alive was the task which the Guardian had entrusted to him. He drowned himself in work and did not stop until the last day of his life. Though broken in health and in and out of hospital for many years, nothing could even slow him down. 

 He was one of the nine Hands chosen to remain at the World Centre of the Faith, and he went through much personal suffering during those first five fateful years as he remembered the days when he followed the Guardian through the gardens or heard him chanting in the Shrines. 

     In the Holy Land Faizi     

 served as a link between his fellow Hands from the East and the West for he spoke and wrote both Persian and English fluently. He also knew Arabic and French very well, both of which were valuable to him in his work for the Cause. 

 Though the burden of work was heavy and his new tasks demanding, Faizi continued to reach out to his friends all over the world through his ever-increasing personal correspondence.  Always a lover of people, he derived much happiness from meeting the groups of pilgrims and their children who came from different countries of the world. He showed them around the Holy Places, and prepared gifts for them to take away. 

Their


<p665>
IN MEMORIAM               665

  response to his warmth was touching as they eagerly awaited his coming each day and sat spellbound when he spoke to them, answering their questions or telling them some of his delightful stories. 

 Many of these pilgrims, too, began to correspond with him after leaving the 

Holy Land.                 

 It is impossible to recount here, even in brief, all the many valuable services Faizi rendered the Faith as a Hand of the Cause and as a member of the 

International Teaching Centre.

 He travelled extensively throughout the whole world, representing the Universal House of Justice at numerous conferences and Conventions; he defended the Cause against its Covenant-breakers, advised National Spiritual Assemblies, met heads of state and world dignitaries, gave public addresses and private talks, conducted study classes for Baha'is, visited the homes of pioneers in every continent,  encouraged the youth to use their talents in the service of the Cause, inspired the hearts through his published writings1 and translations, and never stopped sending out his valued letters even when he was too ill to receive visitors. 

 He had been confined to bed several times during his travels — once he had to be rushed to hospital in the middle of a talk — but he would not be persuaded to look after his health. 

 He fell and rose again and again until his body could no more keep pace with his indefatigable soul. Though unable to travel, he continued to write letters and receive pilgrims in his home to the end of his life in 1980. Among the last papers he left on his desk were a few gifts he had prepared to give away — quotations from the Writings in his own calligraphy. At the bottom of each he had written, 'For the dear pilgrims.' 

 The Guardian, whose vision was not limited by time, had looked at this beautiful life in its entirety, and had written of Faizi in 1942: 'Blessed is he and those who like unto him aided the Cause of God by their words, 1 Some of Faizi's best known works in Persian and English are: Paydm-i-DCis va Bahdr-i-$ad-u-B(st — 120

  The promulgation of the divine teachings revealed by Baha'u'llah was the driving purpose  which animated, directed and sustained. Amoz Gibson throughout his Baha life. This objective perhaps reached the peak of its force between the years 1976 and 1978 when he became so enamored with the publications of the Universal 

House of Justice — Tablets   

 of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Selections from the Writings of the Bab and Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha — that he would arise before dawn to read and reread this storehouse of the knowledge of God which seemed to give him so much strength. 

 Inspired by the Writings, in 1976 he used his vacation period to travel-teach and stimulate the work of the friends in Holland, France, Italy, Mexico and the United States — particularly in the southern states and on the Indian reservations. 

 In countless verses, he pointed out, the friends are exhorted to teach the Faith but in the verse quoted above Baha'u'llah gives teaching the station of assistance to Him. 

 This single verse galvanized Amoz into planning, for the summer of 1978, a two-month journey (less than eight weeks during the last nineteen years of his life were spent purely as vacation) which carried him first to the cradle of the Faith — to Tihr~n, Shfr& IsfahAn, Najaf-Ab~id,  Ardist6n, Thkur, Fort Tabarsf (vieWed from outside), SMf, Tabriz, Ri~16'iyyih, the summer school and Temple land. 

 In these revered spots Amoz was warmed by the outpouring of love by the friends and chastened  and humbled by the miracle of seeing

   Amoz Everett Gibson       

  with his own eyes these places he had read about and talked about and loved for so many years. 

 Moreover, he was deeply moved to learn that the family who were our hosts in Tihr~n had never had the privilege of visiting the House of Baha'u'llah until they were permitted to accompany us. Amoz gave freely of himself and of his time; his advice, wisdom and wit won the hearts of the friends. How he lamented when he learn&d later of the destruction  of the precious House of the Bab and the martyrdom of his two hosts in Tabriz, Mr. Yadu'lhih Ast~ni and Dr. Far6marz Samandari. 

 Amoz continued his journey that summer to the United States where he visited 

Columbia,  Maryland;     

 Washington, D.C.; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Dinnebito, Arizona on the Navajo 

Indian Reservation;       

 Daly City, San Francisco, Placerville and Auburn, 

California;  Reno, Nevada;
Wilmette and Chicago, Illinois;

 Cleveland, Ohio, and Amherst, Massachusetts. 

 Taxing his strength to the utmost he spoke at firesides, public meetings, meetings  for Baha'is only, and had radio and television interviews as well as numerous private consultations. 

 He urged the friends to concentrate their efforts, to select one person to pray for and to teach, to shower with love and gifts. He volunteered to take back to the Holy Land the names of these people and to pray for them in the Shrines. 

 He pleaded for pioneers, named the countries where they were needed and entreated the friends to seize the bounty of assisting Baha'u'llah. 

 Amoz Everett Gibson was born on 3 August  1918 in Washington, D.C. to Deborah and William Gibson. His mother's grandfather was a full-blooded Creek Indian; his father's mother was a mulatto slave and his father's father was Scotch-Irish. 

 William Gibson had trained for the ministry at Howard University in Washington, had become a Christian Science healer, and in 1912, still searching, was attending spiritualist meetings when he was directed to a Baha'i gathering which was meeting in the same building. At his first Baha'i meeting, some time following the visit of 'Abdu'l-Baha to Washingtdn, after hearing Mr. Harlan Ober1 speak for oniy five minutes, Mr. Gibson realized his search had ended. He embraced the Faith immediately and returning home related the Message to his wife who, that same evening, unhesitatingly accepted Baha'u'llah as the return of Christ and the Manifestation of God for this Day. 

 Amoz attended children's classes and went often to Feasts with his father; but as there were few activities arranged at that time for youth he did not enroll in the Faith until 1944. Meanwhile, he had received his education in the Washington public schools and in 1940 was graduated from Miner Teachers College (now the University of the 

District of Columbia)    

 with a B.Sc. degree in education with a major in social studies. In 1941 he married a schoolmate, 

Mary Elizabeth Lane.      

 Amoz was a government employee at the Washington Navy Yard when he was inducted into the United States Army in 1944. He served with the armed forces in Europe and in the 

Pacific on Okinawa.       

 Returning to his home in 1946 he soon became an active participant in the Baha'i community of Washington, D.C. At various times he served as treasurer and chairman of the Local Assembly, was on regional corn-See

  mittees and was elected delegate to the national convention. 

 Using the benefits of the government educational program for veterans and rental income from his home as means of support while serving in the pioneer field, he traveled to Mexico with his wife and two children, William, seven years old, and Kenneth, two. Amoz fell in love with Mexico and its vibrant people and would have remained there permanently  had he and his wife not made a commitment to return to their teaching posts in Washington for at least two more years. In 1951 he received his Master's Degree, summa cum laude, in geography from Mexico 

City College (now University

 of the Americas). Amoz continued his work in the educational field as a teacher at the Browne Junior High School where he had been appointed after his army service. 

 One of his students there would one day become a pioneer to the Pacific and the son-in-law of a martyr of the Faith. 

 Later Amoz was head teacher at the Blow School Annex to Browne; then he was a teacher of geography at Miner Teachers College. 

 His third son was born in 1952 and when Donald was three years old Amoz and his wife resigned from their jobs and pioneered with their three children to the Navajo Indian Reservation in Arizona and New Mexico. Having no employment, the family at first lived with Mr. James Stone, a pioneer to Gallup, New Mexico. 

 While making every effort to secure a position on the reservation through the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, Amoz got a job washing cars. One day one of his customers, noticing him as a newcomer to the small town of 14,000 inhabitants, began a conversation with him. Learning of Aifloz's situation he immediately arranged an interview  for him with the director of the Gallup office of the 

Bureau of Indian Affairs.  

 Within a week, Amoz and his family (except for William who remained in Gallup with Mr. and Mrs. Stone so that he could attend school there) arrived at Pifion, Arizona, near the center of the Navajo Reservation and very close to the Hopi Reservation which it surrounds  — an ideal spot for pioneers, 150 miles from town with two positions open because no one else wanted to fill them. Both Mr. and Mrs. Gibson taught there for four years. 

 The first months were spent making friends and adjusting to teaching older children who had never enrolled in school before and who spoke very little English. Soon, firesides were begun; then, at the close of the first school year, 

Mrs. Meherangiz Munsiff    

 and her daughter, Jyoti, came to visit. The Indian people were greatly attracted to Mrs. Munsiff and in a very marvelous way she set the stage for the first Baha'i study class which was carried on by the Gibsons weekly. 

 In 1957 Sadye Joe, who attended that initial class, became the first of the Navajo tribe to accept the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Sparked by the American Indian Service Committee, of which Amoz was a member, other pioneers settled on the 

Navajo-Irlopi Reservations 
and in the towns bordering them.

 Though distances were great, the roads poor, and driving conditions always hazardous,  there was a strong sense of unity and cooperation among the pioneers. 

 There were two outstanding events which Amoz worked very hard to support and bring to fruition. 

 The first was the visit of Abdu'l-Baha  Rdhiyyih KMnum to the reservation in 1960. Her visit cemented relations among the Baha'is and stimulated new activities. 

 Also, it aroused the interest of the citizens of that area, making them aware of the international character of the Faith and its worldwide importance. 

     Meanwhile, other Navajos   

 had entered the Faith, notably Chester and Franklin Kahn and their wives, whose desire to share the Message with their families and friends Led to the second event — the large weekend gathering of a thousand or more souls at Pine Springs, Arizona, in 1962. They came from far and near, Baha'is and nonBahA'is, and slept in clusters around campfires under a canopy of brilliant stars. The Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llAh Kh4dem, who with his dignified, loving spirit brought everyone closer to Baha'u'llah, provided the stimulus which re-suited in the entry of a great number of new believers, more than 100 in just two days. Mr. Kh6dem said frequently during that weekend, '0 God, increase my astonishment in Thee!' What joy and assurance this meeting brought to Amoz's heart. At last the work was moving forward. 

 In 1959 Amoz was appointed to the Auxiliary  Board for protection; in 1960 he was


<p668>
668                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the 

United States. As a Board  

 member he traveled extensively throughout the western states and also made a trip to Jamaica and Haiti. 

 He served as a member of the National Teaching 

Conimittee for Africa      

 and represented  the National Assembly at. the dedication of the Baha'i Temple in Uganda in 1961, taking this opportunity to teach in the villages near Kampala and making firm and lasting friendships among the African believers. 

 Amoz moved from Pifion, Arizona, to teach English in the secondary school at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, and resided in Gallup about 14 miles distant. In 1960, after the birth of his daughter, Nancy, he was appointed principal of the Bread Springs Day School in New Mexico, and the family were living there when Amoz, attending the first International Convention in Haifa, in 1963, was elected to the Universal 

House of Justice. As       

 a small boy, holding his father's hand as he walked along to Feasts, Amoz had heard him speak about the institution of the Universal House of Justice in such glowing, lofty terms that Amoz never expected it to come into existence  during his owfl lifetime. However, once that institution did come into being he supported  it with a deep, unswerving loyalty, with complete obedience and respect, with a feeling  of humbleness and awe, and regarded all the other members as his true and loving brothers. 

 It was apparent that they heM that same regard for him as they tenderly bore his casket to its resting place. 

 Just prior to his election to the House of Justice, the entire family, encouraged by Abdu'l-Baha Rii~ifyyih KlAnum was making arrangements to pioneer to Africa, so the process of breaking ties with the Navajo Reservation, which had become home, was already begun. 

 Arriving in Haifa in July 1963, Amoz took up his duties and responsibilities with the zest he was always enabled to summon when he found himself in a new and difficult situation. He was particularly pleased to be appointed convener of the Departmefit of Holy Places as this gave him the opportunity to inspect every corner of these hallowed buildings and to assist in providing for their preservation, renovation and day-to-day care. 

 He said he felt, when he stood on the ledge just outside the lantern as was necessary in the course of his duties, that he could stretch out his arms and almost embrace the Shrine of the BTh. 

 When a new roof had to be put on the Mansion at Baha, or new gardens laid out; when roads had to be built, or land purchased, or fences put up; when heavy wooden beams had to be secured from Turkey for the house of 'Abdu'lhh P~sM;' when additional office space had to be found at the temporary seat of the House of Justice on Haparsim Street; when the obelisk was to be erected on the Temple Land;2 when a completely new electrical system was to be installed in the Shrine of the BTh (completed in October, 1980); when the Permanent Seat of the Universal House of Justice was being planned and built, Amoz was always there, alert, spotting proW lems and avoiding or correcting them, pacing off metres, measuring walls, writing letters to various companies, inspecting the marbk cutting in Italy, visiting stone and gravel pits, signing contracts, restraining or complaining to or encouraging and praising the workers —  and loving every minute of it. One of his true brothers remarked that he should have been an engineer. 

 Amoz became ill in San Francisco in Au gust 1980, the evening before he was to fulfill his heart's desire to visit the Omaha Indian community of Macy, Nebraska, so dear to the Hand of the Cause Amelia Collins, and just after he had participated, in July, in the memorable Native Council of the indigenous believers of North America in Wilmette, Illinois. 

 Upon his return to Haifa his illness was diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia which usually attacks the young and is often curable in children. 

 During his 'heroic struggle' against this disease Amoz lightened the hearts with his ready wit and open smile and won the admiration of doctors, nurses and patients whom he met at the clinic where he went periodically for treatment. He took their photographs and distributed them as gifts; he sent them flowers and generally showered them with love. He was able to enjoy about a year of complete remission. 

 When that period ended he decided to visit each one of his children whom he so dearly See The Baha'i World, vol. XVI, p. 103.

  loved and who, in turn, had given him so much devdtion and appreciation throughout the years that often deprived them of his presence. This journey to Australia where Amoz had the bounty of his first visit to the Mother Temple of the Antipodes; to New Zealand to see Nancy and her husband, Jonathan;  to Oakland, California, where Diane, Kenneth and Chehreh live; to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to visit Cheryl, Don, Lanya and Maria; and to Washington where he was joined by Bill who had braved snowy roads on his trip from Massachusetts and New York to see his father — this journey Amoz was able to accomplish by the grace of God, the loving consideration of Baha'is and non-Bahd'is alike, and by his own strong will and determination. 

 When he• was no longer able to fulfill his duties, to actively serve the Cause, to assist Baha'u'llah by teaching, it seemed he had little desire to remain on this plane of existence.  Despite this, out of compassion for those around him, he compelled his spirit to shine brightly and gladly till the very end. 

 He passed away in Haifa on 14 May 1982, having had the bounty just three weeks before of praying in the three Holy Shrines with his wife, four children, one of his daughters-in-law and two of his three grandchildren. As his daughter Nancy so lovingly expressed, he was a dearly-loved husband, father and grandfather whose whole lifework was devoted to the service and promulgation of this blessed Cause, whose laughter and radiance were an inspiration to all and whom we love with all our hearts.

  BERNARD   LEACH CM., C.B.E. 1887 — 1 979 My first breath of air was a cry of pain; Will my last be a smile? 

            Bernard Leach              

  6 May 1979. He was sitting by the window in his hospital room talking with his daughter Eleanor, a friend and two nurses, about where they were born. It was Bernard's turn to contribute: 'I was born in Hong Kong' — [on 5 January 1887] — but the words wouldn't come. He put his hand to his chest, drew his last breath and was gone. 

 I have made death a messenger of joy How these much-quoted words of Baha'u'llah applied to Bernard Leach himself. 

 He had done in his earthly life what he had to do and died happily in that knowledge. Now it is up to us to use what he has left. 

 Bernard Leach was the son of a colonial judge. 

 His mother died when he was born and the first four years of his life were spent with grandparents in Japan. 

 As a potter, artist and writer he is internationally known. The importance of his work was his liaison between East and West — he connected artistically, culturally and spiritually.  He wrote: 'As far back as 1913 it began to become apparent how that which we call fate lay 'behind my original intuition to return to the East where I was born. My own work as a potter and draughtsman was inextricably becoming rooted in two hemispheres and I began to find myself in the position of a courier between East and West. 

 By one way or another I bore witness to a growing vision

  of a future unity of mankind. 

 Agnosticism of many years' standing gave way to an expanding  faith in the maturity of man on this '1 planet It was in 1914 that he first heard about the Baha'i 

Faith, from Agnes Alexander2

 in Japan.  The seeds were sown. That same year in a privately published small book, A Review, he wrote: 'I have seen a vision of the marriage of East and West, and far off down the Halls of Time I heard the echo of a childlike Voice. How long, how long? The books which remain to be written, first and foremost, and greatest, The Bible of East and West a love-union of the two hemispheres; a mystic ring on the finger of the world.' 

 From 1909 until 1920 he lived in Japan and the Far East, making many friends, and becoming known not only as a gifted artist-craftsman  but for his spiritual perception of Japanese values. He went many times to Japan and, in 1966, for his cultural service to that country he received the highest honour

 to be conferred upon a British commoner by the Japanese government: The Order of the Sacred Treasure, second class. 

 It was Mark Tobey? with whom be made friends in the early thirties when at Dartington Hall in Devonshire, who deepened his interest in the Baha'i Faith. Mark was resident art teacher; Bernard taught pottery, as well as keeping in touch with the St. 

Ives Pottery. Reg Turveyj  

 Bernard's friend from the early years they spent together at the Slade School and the London College of Art, also came to Dartington to paint, bringing his family. 

 He and his wife went to Baha gatherings and accepted the Faith before Bernard did. It was after Mark returned to America and Bernard delved more deeply into the books he left him, that he became convinced. 

 As they had hoped to do, these three Baha'i artists met again at the Baha'i World Congress in 1963 in London. Reg, who had been referred to by the Guardian as 'the father of the Baha'is of South Africa', died in Durban in 1968. Before Mark passed away in Basle, Switzerland, in April 1976, he was so happy to receive a cable from Bernard, MARK 

I AM WITH YOU IN SPIRIT    

 NOW AND FOREVER. I remember hearing Bernard shouting, during the last stages of his earthly life, 'Reg, it won't be long!' Now the three are reunited. 

 When Bernard travelled to Japan after becoming a Baha'i he fitted in Baha'i talks with his work as a potter. He spoke fluent Japanese and became much loved by the people of that country. 

 In 1953 his pamphlet My Religious Faith was printed both in English and Japanese,  on Japanese paper, and reached many people. 

Prior to Abdu'l-Baha      

 Riihiyyih Kh6num's visit to Japan in 1978 he wrote introducing her to some of his acquaintances there, including Princess Chichibu, who afterwards  wrote to Bernard to say how much she had enjoyed her visit. Towards the end of her nine-week travels around Japan, R6hfyyih KlPnum wrote to Bernard: 'wherever anyone knows our contact with you, we are received with special honours.

  took with them, as gifts for the Emperor and Empress, a pilgrim plate made by Bernard and an etching he did in Japan in 1918. Preyjous to that, in 1973, in a private audience with the Queen at Buckingliam Palace, he became the first craftsman ever to be made a Companion of Honour; he had been made a C.B.E.1 in 1962 and over the years received many professional awards. 

 The recent book The Art of Bernard Leach2 was a tribute by the Victoria and Albert Museum following his retrospective exhibition there in 1977. The editor, who was the exhibition organizer, ends his foreword by referring to Bernard as 'the greatest artist-potter-writer of this age'. A book review of Bernard's Beyond East and West3 goes further perhaps one of the greatest men of our time'. 

 But Bernard never wanted to be put on a pedestal; his humility was one of his most endearing qualities. 'When you're young it's difficult to get rid of the ego — it wants to see the shine and the colour of butterfly wings,' he said in an interview.4 'But as you get older you are gradually freed of pride.' The blindness which in the latter years of his life prevented his continuing his gifted work as a craftsman and artist he accepted as the will of God: 'Losing outer sight, I gained far greater inner vision. 

 Bernard Leach's books, particularly Drawings, Verse and Belief and Beyond East and West, have been instrumental in attracting many people to the Baha Faith. Press reviews of the latter in various countries, as well as articles — even as far away as Australia — have mentioned his Baha'i belief. 

 Bernard welcomed visitors from all over the world and received letters of appreciation from them as well as from readers of his books, the last from a potter in the United States a few days before Bernard died, from which I quote: 'I wanted to write to tell you what a great deal you have taught me — not oniy about pots but about life. I hope some day to be able to teach just one small thing to another, to show one person something new. With your guidance, perhaps I shall 1 Commander (of the Order) of the British Empire.

    CLEMENTINA MEJIA DE PAVON 

 1900 — 1979  

  SEGUNDO PAVON BARRERA     

 1894 — 1979 Clementina de Pav6n preceded her husband Segundo Pav6n into the Faith by a few months in 1960, and in 1979 she preceded him, again by a few months, into the Abh6 Kingdom. They had spent nineteen years serving together  the interests of the Cause, of their children and of the Baha'i community of Ecuador, especially the indigenous believers of the Otavalo and Cachaco areas. 

 Both Mr. and Mrs. Pav6n were the 'spiritual children' of their own son, Ra6l Pav6n, who became a Baha'i during the Ten Year Crusade and is now a member of the 

Continental Board of Counsellors

 in the Americas. He purposely left the Baha'i books lying about his parents' house hoping his mother would read them to 'see what he was mixed up in'. The result of her investigation was that Dofia Clementina embraced the Cause in July of 1960. 

 In December of the same year, her husband Segundo wrote a perceptive letter to the National Teaching Committee explaining that he had made a thorough investigation of the Faith, having studied The Covenant of 

Baha'u'llah and The Dispensation

 of Baha'u'llah as well as the communications his wife had been receiving from Assemblies and


<p672>
672                 THE BAHA I WORLD

Clementina Mejia de PavOn 

  committees. He related that through his study he had come to recogniz&BabA'u'lhh. 

 'I have found the light with which the Lord our God has deemed to inspire his Divine Messengers to spread true faith in God, and being convinced of this reality, I desire to be accepted as a new believer in the Faith of Baha'u'llah.' The light he found at that time was to guide his life until the end of his time on earth. 

 The Pav6ns were both born in Otavalo, a small Ecuadorian city in the Province of Imba-bura, the province that holds the largest concentration of indigenous Baha'is in that country. As this century opened, they were children growing up among the native people, learning Quechua, the lingua franca of the Andes, and learning also to appreciate the qualities and the culture of a greatly underestimated and disparaged people. 

 They acquired those humane qualities and that spiritual nature that distinguished their years as Baha'is and gave them the unique ability to identify with the Quechua-speakers they served. 

 They married in 1920 and had nine children, two of whom died young. 

 They lived to see all their surviving children and a number of 

  Segundo Pav6n Barrera     

  grandchildren accept the Faith. Their lives were, even before their exposure to the Faith, devoted to humanitarian objectives. 

 Mr. Pa-vdn  was a civil servant, who well understood the needs of the Indians, and his wife, a loving mother to her own children, was also widely known as Mother Pav6n, a beloved 'mater familias' for all who needed her. 

 Early in their marriage they purchased a farm in Cachaco, miles from any city, so that their children could be raised in a healthy and spiritual environment. It was in a jungle-like area with no transportation, not even roads. An undependable train which ran at irregular intervals at some distance from their home was the only means of travel in or out. They could not have foreseen at this time that the farm would become a school under Baha'i auspices and a training institute for the native believers of Ecuador. Seeing the needs of the children of Cachaco, who were without educational facilities, they opened a school in their home, supporting it from the proceeds of their farm insofar as possible. 

     When the National Spiritual

 Assembly of Ecuador was formed in 1961, the Pav6ns gave it their wholehearted support, and began sending frequent detailed reports of their


<p673>
IN MEMORIAM               673

  activities. In an early letter to the Assembly Dofia Clementina wrote that she was teaching the principles of the Faith to the children of their school so that they would grow up to be true Baha'is. A few weeks later she sent notice that four of her pupils who ranged in age from six to sixteen years, had accepted the Faith. 

 In August 1962 they shared with the National Assembly their happiness over the acclaim they received from the Ministry of Education for their efforts in educating campesino  children. 

 Unfortunately, a few months later Mrs. Pav6n was greatly tested when she heard from the provincial director of education that she could not be considered a teacher as she had no degree in teaching. He wanted to send a young graduate with a degree to the area. 

 Mr. Pav6n wrote to say 'The truth is, the priest and his followers have offered to open a school in the area and take away our school'. 

 In spite of the machinations against the school, their faith never wavered. Dofla Clementina wrote asking for prayers for guidance, her words reflecting her undaunted spirit: 'I always have confidence in the help of Baha'u'llah and the prayers of our fellow-Bah&fs' and that 'God is greater than every great one'. The school continued, with daily classes for twenty children and literacy classes for adults in the evenings and on Sundays. Through their work enrolments in the Faith continued month after month. Reflecting on the lives of Segundo and Clementina Pav6n from this vantage point in time, it appears that their independent effort to provide schooling to campesino children and literacy classes to adults, might well be regarded as one of the earliest of the 'tutorial schools' called for many years later in the Nine Year 

Plan.                      
  When the National Spiritual

 Assembly needed a couple to work with the indigenous people in the areas of mass conversion, they knew they had in the Pav6ns two capable believers with an innate respect for the Indians, and who were well-versed in their language and culture. They were asked by the Assembly to move from Cachaco to serve as pioneers in Otavalo, their natal city. The Pav6ns, in agreeing to the task assigned to them in Otavalo, were able to happily inform the National Assembly that the children of Cachaco would continue to receive education, for through Mr. Pav6n's efforts a public school had been established and a road into the area had been opened. 

 In Otavalo the two worked tirelessly together  on many projects. Sefiora Pav6n was inspired to write songs, poetry and translations,  while Sefior Pav6n spent many hours at the typewriter acting as her secretary, recording her work, meticulously and precisely, as was his nature. 

 The songs of Clementina Pav6n, based on Baha'i texts and set to the haunting Andean melodies she had heard from childhood, are played daily on 'Radio Baha'i of Ecuador' and are sung in villages and international conferences around the world. One of them was sung by a choir in the Mother Temple of Latin America in Panama. 

 They are songs that teach and instruct, that rejoice in the joy of being a Baha, that bring the Manifestation close to the believer and that strike a responsive  note in the hearts of children and adults alike. 'Radio Baha'i' in its early years would have been musically impoverished without the contributions of Doiia Clementina de Pav6n. And her translations of the Writings into Quechua made possible the Quechua programming  of the station. 

 In Otavalo, too, the Pav6ns taught indigenous  people to read and write. They helped to engender respect for the Quechua language, and to revive and restore its use among Quechua-speakers themselves, who were losing vocabulary from their language along with the self-respect of which they had been deprived by a Spanish-language culture. Mrs. Pav6n helped to train the Quechua-speakers who were the first radio announcers to speak about the Faith in their mother tongue to their own people. 

 Their story would not be complete without the story of Jos6 Manuel. 

 WI)en they learned that a mother was in the marketplace trying to sell her partially paralysed four-year-old child who was also mute, they immediately took the child, disregarding the fact that they had a houseful of their own children. 

 They feared that someone would take him who would not give him love. Jos6 Manuel grew up with the Pav6n children as one of their brothers. Through their love and unwavering faith they were able to teach him many things, including the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and the


<p674>
674                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ability to utter a few words. Jose Manuel is now a man, a Baha'i, devoted and ready to serve the Faith and the friends at all times. When their success with Jos6 Manuel was noted, they were offered another unwanted child who was totally deaf and mute. They accepted it and gave it the same loving care. Both are today loved and cared for by the Pav6ns' children. 

 As the years passed and the health of the Pav6ns began to fail, they moved, at the urging of their children, to a warmer climate at a lower altitude to live with a daughter. While they enjoyed being with their family, they soon felt restless at being far from the heart of Baha'i activities, and in time returned to Otavalo and became engaged in the work of the Baha'i Institute. Over the years they were mother and father to many pioneers who had the privilege of working with and learning from them. Pioneers and others relied on the herbal remedies 

Mother Pav6n dispensed. Particularly

 in Cachaco, where there had been no doctors and no telephones, the sick would often turn to the Pav6ns for help. Both served in countless ways on Assemblies and committees, national and local, as teachers, administrators and collaborators with conventions,  institutes and every Baha'i event of the busy years during which the Faith dramatically increased both its numbers and its activities in Ecuador. 

 Segundo Pav6n's deep love for Baha'u'llah, his ardent desire to serve the Cause, and his complete devotion to his wife were all demonstrated  at the time of her passing. While she was in hospital, Mr. Pavdn, himself ill and quite fragile, was busy correcting her translation  into 

Quechua of Baha'u'llah    

 and the New Era in order to be sure that her last work would be complete and well-done. It seemed at that time that his sole desire was to complete this mission and join her. 

 Their staunch and unyielding faith in Baha'u'llah was the cohesive influence that welded this inseparable couple together in service to the Cause. They were richly rewarded  in this life by seeing their son Ra6l named to the Continental Board of Counsellors  in the Americas, two daughters, Isabel Pav6n de Calder6n and Clemencia Pav6n de Zuleta named to the Auxiliary Board, and all their other surviving children enrolled as devoted Baha'is. They are: Rafael Pav6n Mejia, Aida Pav6n de Espin, 

Cecilia Pav6n de Wilson   
and Teresa Pav6n de Narvaez.

 On the passing of Clementina Mejia de Pavdn, on 17 

May 1979, the Universal   

 House of Justice cabled:

     HELEN EGGLESTON           

 1892 — 1979  

Helen Latimer Whitney     

 was born in Portland, Oregon, on 1 June 1892, the daughter of Kate Latimer Whitney and Edwin D. Whitney. Whitney, Marzieh Gail advises, was a prominent  Lansing, Michigan, businessman, and owned one of America's most complete private gun collections, its oldest item being an Arab firearm, very light, for cavalry, dating back about three hundred years. 

 His other avocation was making birdhouses. 

        Helen, The American Baha'i

 of July 1979 reports, became a Baha'i in Portland 'some seventy years ago after learning of the Faith from a relative of hers, George Orr Latimer Iwbo died in 1948]', and 'will be best remembered for her pioneering work in Baha'i education through the establishment f with her husband, Lou (1872 — 1953)] 
of the Louhelen

IN MEMORIAM                675

     Helen Eggleston            

  School near Davison, Michigan', whose first session was held 'in August 1931 with the approval of Shoghi 

Effendi'.                  
       Helen met Lou Eggleston1   

 in the Baha'i House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois; they were married on 24 December 1930. 

 Marzieh Gail in an unpublished reminiscence gives us a vivid picture of the couple set against the background of the creation and development of the school which was to bear their names: 'Helen was thirty-eight at the time of her marriage, slender and youthful in appearance, and she stayed that way throughout her life. Lou was fifty and had other family, Helen being his third wife. They produced two children of their own, first a daughter, Lou-helen, and Later a son, "Buzzie." 

Although a recent Baki'f   

 at the time of their marriage, Lou then dedicated his life, as did Helen, to an enterprise which would be of value to the Faith. Searching the rural area near Davison, a few miles out of Flint they discovered a Large property which had outbuildings and a deserted farm house. 

 The house was fifty years old, built for the ages, with that confidence in the future, those selfrespecting lines, that American architects can apparently

 Ba/id'! World, vol. XII, p. 712. 

 no longer reproduce. It had oak timbers; the rest was of white pine lumber throughout. No plumbing, only a cistern under the kitchen and a pitcher and pump at the sink. 

 Four porches, rotting away. It had last been painted forty years before. 

 Lou, a genius-level, self taught engineer who had been obliged to leave school at eleven, went to work on the house and its 280 acres. On i August 1931 was held the first session ever of the first Baha Summer School in the central part of the United States, (There were only two other Baha schools in America at that time, Green Acre in Maine, and 

Geyserville in California.)

 'Names associated with that first nine-day session were Dorothy Baker, Louis 

Gregory, Harlan and Grace  
Ober, Howard and Mabel Ives,

May Harvey Gift, Christine 
McKay, Fanny Knobloch      

 and Mary Collison. Those in attendance met on the porch of a Jog cabin on Kersley Creek, which ran through the property, or sat on bleachers at the water's edge. The Guardian was very pleased with that first success and urged the friends to "do even more next season." The Egglestons toiled to plan the courses and expand the facilities From the beginning, with continuous  guidance from the Guardian and served by national committees, the school was youth-oriented. 

 It stressed Baha'i administration and also the study of Is1~m and the Qur'an, for on 2 December 1935 the Guardian wrote: "The knowledge of this Sacred Scripture  is absolutely indispensable for every believer who wishes adequately and intelligently  to read the Writings of 

Baha'u'llah."               

 'In 1939, a handsome, official library was opened to the public, while Helen's private collection of Baha'i books and rare pamphlets was becoming perhaps the best in the country. Her knowledge of the Faith was well organized,  so that if you had a question, you would often turn to her for a documented reply. 

 'In 1949, a nine-acre tract, including the main residence and all the other buildings and recreational grounds, was deeded by Helen and Lou to the National Spiritual Assembly. Meanwhile, with the help of a tenant farmer, varied activities were constantly going on: goats were raised; a special kind of flour was developed; additional dormitories were constructed;  a tenqis court, outdoor grill for wiener roasts and a craft center were provided;


<p676>
676                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  a conservatory was established upstairs in the residence; and the Louhelen Baha'i Choir was created by Esther 

Wilson of Bradley College.

 'Helen was known for developing new talent and many a teacher, crowded out by established talent elsewhere, got a start at Louhekn and found that he or she had abilities previously undiscovered. 

 What Helen contributed throughout was to rule her domain  with the proverbial rod of iron; but unlike most "dictators" she had a sense of the ridiculous. 

 When you watched her carefully you noticed a barely perceptible tic, a small twitch to hex lips. Whether the humor came first, or the tic, we do not know; but in any case they matched. 

 Her custom when she first met a person was to test him out: she would stare at him out of round brown eyes, her mouth twitching just a bit, and make some outrageous statement, and watch to see how the individual responded. 

 She once greeted a new arrival at the school with: "Your room is in suchandsuch a building; bedtime is ten o'clock; all the mail is read before we deliver it to you; good night!"' The operation of running 

Louhelen, Mar-zieh  Gail  

 continues, 'involved administering thousands of people, over the years, and it was Helen's continuous, invaluable, personal supervision, reinforced by Lou, that made Louhelen School the unique institution it was •   Helen had small, delicate hands, and I doubt that she ever cooked anything or wielded a broom in her life, but she collected and closely supervised a fine staff. Not everyone was enthusiastic over the goat's milk and kelp which formed part of the Louhelen menu — and you were not allowed to escape to the city of Flint for a meal. Nor did Helen care for the individual's private ideas of what to eat. "The worst part is having to deal with all their special diets," she once confided. "You take today. Mrs. X has just informed me that she cannot possibly eat veal. So — deadpan  stare and slight twitch of the lips — "she's going to get some lovely chicken." 

 I once asked her how, with all those buildings, she warded off a long succession of self-invited guests. 

 "I explain that there's lots of work for them to do around the ranch," she said. "Lots of weeding, painting, driving the tractor, milking the goats To prevent cliques, she made each one sit by a different person at each meal. As for circumventing budding romances, she said: "Takes about two weeks to get 'em started. 

 Then we send 'em home and schedule a different study course.~~ 'Basically egalitarian in spite of her Junior League background, she was as real as a sack of potatoes. 

 She neither wanted nor accepted adulation for herself Shy and vulnerable at heart, when confronted with formal guests she would have someone else present to manage the conversation. Nevertheless, even though it involved facing unfamiliar people, she was so anxious to have good relations between the school and the inhabitants of the area that she would g6out of her way to make friends. 

 One autumn she and Lou arranged for me to give talks on some forty platforms in surrounding towns — at schools, in churches, at men's service clubs, Rotary, Lions, the Kiwanis (the entire peas-and-chicken-~Aa-king circuit) — they themselves driving me in the overheated car (Helen couldn't stand the cold) through the bare, wintry fields. Practical, the two would combine other errands along with getting to the lecture It was Helen whO arranged the lecture engagements In those days religion was a taboo subject on most platforms of the kind I have mentioned; you walked on eggs, and the relevance of the Baha'i Faith to the world situation was not understood. (Neither infact was the world situation.) 

 Lou was a member of Rotary himself, and as the years went by, the school gained in local prestige, and clubs in the area would often ask for Baha'i speakers.  One summer the Civitan Club of Flint used Baha'i speakers for three successive meetings, the Zonta Club featured a staff speaker from Louhelen School, and the Hint radio station interviewed another. 

 Winning this type of recognition was a considerable achievement for the time and place. 

 Various groups would also make use of the public library on the grounds, and sometimes rent the school for conferences of their own 'The home Helen shared with Lou and her children and thousands of Baha, and others, taught its own message and imparted its own memories that still linger in the mind. 

 As for the budding romances nipped in the bud, we think there must be many a couple who still turn back, over the years, to their days in that lovely place.'

IN MEMORIAM                677

  Though best remembered for her association  with 

Louhelen School, Helen    

 served the Cause faithfully in various capacities throughout  her lifetime and until her last breath maintained an active interest in its worldwide development and expansion. The gift of a copy of the new publication Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha sent to her by Lois Goebel elicited a happy response dated 17 April 1979, a month before her passing: '0 Lois! How can I thank you for this precious, priceless Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha!  It arrived yesterday. The power of His Word shakes one, and is overwhelming, and I've only read a few pages! Thank you, my dear, so very, very much for your thoughtfulness  and kindness. Do you know that section 167, page 198, is a Tablet that I had the blessing of receiving from the Master?' 

 The National Spiritual    

 Assembly of the United States in its cable announcing the passing  of Helen 

Eggleston on 9 May 1979   

 paid tribute to this 'stalwart, generous-hearted handmaiden Baha'u'llah whose name along with husband's will be associated with development

  ELIZABETH KIDDER OBER     

 1902 — 1979  

     ALICE C. KIDDER           

 1902 — 1981 0       ye handmaids of the merciful Lord! How many queens of this world laid down their heads on a pillow of dust and disappeared. 

 No fruit was left of them, no trace, no sign, not even their names Not so the handmaids who ministered at the Threshold of God; these have shone forth like glittering stars in the skies of ancient glory, shedding their splendours across all the reaches of time. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha These words of 'Abdu'l-Baha call to my mind the lives of dedication to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, and of service to the world of humanity, of our dearly loved twins, 

Dr. Alice Gertrude Kidder 
and Dr. Elizabeth Meriel  

Kidder Ober.              

 Born on 22 September 1902, in Beverly, Massachusetts, to Arthur Harvey Kidder, patternmaker, and Gertrude Majia Glines, schoolteacher, Alice and Elizabeth were raised, with their brother Harold, two years older than they, in a loving and spacious rural home. 

 By the time they reached age eleven, the spirit of dedication to the service of mankind that was to characterize their lives was born. Their mother, active in the Congregational Church, often arranged visits from missionaries  home on furlough from various countries. Many times Alice and Elizabeth, as children, were sent to the railroad station in their pony-cart  to welcome and bring home those missionary  speakers. 

 Learning about mission life abroad decided the young girls that the only hope for the masses was education in physical hygiene and the acquisition of spiritual virtues. 

 Their father taught them to look always with a searching eye for the truth in every situation. 

 These parental influences set the pattern of their lives. They pursued studies in osteopathic, homeopathic and naturopathic medicine. 

 Elizabeth became an osteopathic physician first, graduating in 1927. Alide graduated a decade later and in the interval looked after their parents and carried on their father's flourishing greenhouse business. 

 When, in 1934, Elizabeth learned of the Baha'i Faith from Lorna Tasker, a patient and later dear friend of hers, she knew in an instant that she would become a Baha'i. 

 At precisely the same time in another city, Alice first heard the name of Baha'u'llah. 

 The twins hastened to share their momentous discovery, only to find the other already knew. 

 Taught by other prominent Baha teachers, including Helen 

Archambault, Alice's      

 spiritual mother and Grace Robarts Ober and her husband

  Elizabeth Kidder Ober      

  Harlan Ober, patients of Elizabeth's, the twins became Baha'is in Boston in 1939 and served the Faith of Baha'u'llah to the eifd of their earthly lives. 

     Harlan and Grace Ober      

 had been married by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1912. Harlan was devastated by Grace's death in 1938 but learned to find comfort in an awareness of her continuing influence in his life. He never doubted that part of her legacy to him was yet another extremely happy marriage. On 21 June 1941 he married Dr. Elizabeth Kidder. A postscript in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi appended  to a letter written on his behalf on 20 June 1941 conveyed the Guardian's 'heartfelt  congratulations' and the assurance of his 'best wishes'. 

 Grace Ober's dearly loved nephew, the Hand of the Cause John A. Robarts, gives a glimpse of his great affection and esteem for the twins: 'My Aunt Grace's death was a shock. We all loved her very much, but three years later Harlan married Elizabeth Kidder, and as she had a twin sister, Alice, this meant that while I had lost one aunt, I acquired two new almost-aunts. 

 They were delightful people, devoted 

     Alice G. Kidder            

  Baha, skilled osteopaths, and with Harlan were Baha'i pioneers in Southern Africa near where my wife, Audrey, and I lived with two of our children, Patrick and Nina. They kept us all in good health. In describing their dedication to serving others, Harlan said, "They are like two fire-horses; come back to the firehall after standing for hours at a fire, exhausted, but ready to dash out to another fire without a murmur of complaint."' Anyone who knew Elizabeth and Alice will recall with ~we and amusement their extraordinary  relationship as identical twins. As children they delighted in confusing their teachers and classmates; as doctors in practice together, they could substitute for each other when necessary, some patients never knowing the difference. They had telepathic communication: while one wrote a letter, the recipient was already sending the answer before having received the question. 

 Whenever one was ill, the other came immediately to the rescue with medical expertise and that loving spirit of service for which they were both famous. They shared an uncanny ability to perceive and rise to the needs of others — physical, emotional or spiritual needs — and in the


<p679>
IN MEMORIAM                679

  process, those who opened themselves to their care discovered such qualities as Alice's self effacing efficiency, her resourcefulness, tenderness  and wisdom; or Elizabeth's sense of humour and determination to explore alternatives, overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles. 

 Elizabeth and Harlan were elected to the Spiritual Assembly of Beverly in 1942. They held regular firesides, travel-taught, gave public  talks. For a time Elizabeth served on the Regional Teaching Committee. Alice was elected to the Spiritual Assembly of Greenwich.  All three were, at different times, delegates to national conventions and speakers at Louhelen 

Baha School; Elizabeth  
and Harlan also at Green  

Acre.                     

 In May 1953 at the Mother Temple of the West, Alice responded at once to the launching  of the beloved Guardian's Ten Year Crusade by offering to pioneer to the Union of 

South Africa. In March    

 1954, after correspondence had been delayed in the committee, Shoghi Effendi advised her to go immediately. Within two days she was on her way. Elizabeth  and Harlan deputized her. During her pilgrimage, en route to South Africa, Shoghi Effendi directed her to Pretoria, the capital city, where she arrived in April 1954. It was during this pilgrimage that she first drew close to Abdu'l-Baha 

Riihfyyih KhAnum, Shoghi Effendi's

 wife, through treating her and spending  some time in her company — a bond which was later to develop and mean so much in both their lives. 

 Alice's life, alone in her pioneer post, was an example of complete faith and courage as she quietly went about finding and furnishing a downtown office, and building up a medical practice among the white population in accordance  with the prevailing racial restrictions of the land. With discretion she used the office also as a place of contact for teaching and held classes there each week. Dedicating every day to the service of Baha'u'llah, she remained steadfast through many difficulties. 

 Her joy knew no bounds when, in March 1956, she was joined by Elizabeth and Harlan who also made their pilgrimage to the Holy Land before reaching South Africa. Alice and the first Tswana Baha'i woman, Dorothy Senna, had laid a foundation, in Lady Sel-bourne,  for the formation of the first all-African 

African Local Spiritual   

 Assembly in the Pretoria area and in April 1956, following the expressed wish of the Guardian, the Obers brought the institution into being. 

 Aided by Alice they also raised up a Spiritual 

Assembly in Atteridgeville
in 1958.                  

 The twin doctors were greatly loved by their patients. 
Their practice grew.      

 Functioning as a team with Harlan in their Baha work they taught at every opportunity and conducted study classes twice weekly. Harlan's stories of 'Abdu'l-Baha welded together  the hearts of pioneers and local believers  and difficulties often melted into joy and laughter. Alice, Elizabeth and Harlan will long be lovingly remembered for their vital service of deepening the knowledge of the friends in the Pretoria area, many of whom are today serving the Faith with exemplary capacity and devotion. 

 The pinnacle of Alice's life was the six years she served Abdu'l-Baha Riihiyyih Kh4num as physician and companion from 1958 to 1964. 

 Abdu'l-Baha's own words, cabled at the time of Alice's passing, best describe this achievement:

  During Alice's six-year absence, Elizabeth maintained the medical practice alone, and she and Harlan continued their Baha work including teaching trips to Mozambique, Swaziland,  Zululand, 

Basutoland and Rhodesia. They

 served on the National Teaching Committee  of 

South and West Africa     

 for some years. On 20 July 1962 Harlan died. 
Urged to do so by Abdu'l-Baha

Riihiyyih Kh6num Alice    

 returned to South Africa in 1964. Ever since Harlan's death R6hfyyih KMnum had felt it was not right to separate the twins and that Elizabeth needed her more than she did. The sisters remained another five years in South Africa, continuing their practice together. 

 Elizabeth went to the United States in 1967


<p680>
680                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and spent four dusty months carefully sorting through and distributing to the 

International, American   

 and Canadian Baha'i archives an enormous collection of historical and other papers dating back to 1905 which had belonged to Harlan, and to Grace and Ella Robarts. While there, Elizabeth traversed the country from coast to coast and gave twenty-five well-received  Baha talks. 

     In 1969 Alice and Elizabeth

 made their farewell teaching trip to Cape Town, an unforgettable feast of love among their Baha friends of all races. 

 Returning to the United States, they settled in St. Petersburg, Florida. They longed to pioneer again, but were plagued by incredible mishaps. 

 Both sisters were constitutionally prone to breaking their bones. 

 Each suffered a severe hip fracture. Alice never really walked again. 

 With heroic determination and fortitude, still imbued with their passionate desire to pioneer and not merely to rust out and die in their homeland, Elizabeth arranged their final move, this time to their pioneer post in Guadalajara, Mexico, where they arrived, 

Elizabeth in May 1975, Alice
the following month.      

 At RidvTh 1978 they were elected to the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Zapopan, Elizabeth serving as chairman. 

 Despite difficulties arising from not speaking Spanish, Elizabeth participated in brief teaching trips in Jalisco and Nayarit, and she and Alice both wade valiant efforts to deepen the friends, their home a centre of Baha activity, frequent firesides, theft Baha library available to all who came to study there. 

 The twins were taken to hospital following a car accident in November 1978 and shortly thereafter it became evident that they could not return to their home. After a lifetime of serving others, they were now surrounded by what seemed to be a band of angels who attended to their every need. Foremost among these were the Sala family, Emeric, Rosemary, Ida and Paul, who, respectively and collectively,  looked after their financial affairs, their correspondence and voluminous historical papers, the disposal of their possessions, their daily needs; and Jack 

Jacobs, a gifted Baha    

 medical student whose visits each day brought laughter and assurance of the best medical attention, and somehow, sometimes, a favourite treat: chocolate ice cream. All who were privileged to be near the sisters in their final months were touched by their detachment from worldly things, their courage, steadfastness and humour in the face of overwhelming difficulties and suffering. 

 In March 1981, when she was in Mexico during a tour of Central America, Rhhiyyih KhThum made a special trip to Guadalajara to see Alice in her nursing home and stayed long enough to visit her on three different occasions. This brought great joy to both of them, Alice brightening up to very much her old self and, with childlike pleasure, eating the ice cream brought as a gift. 

 Elizabeth left this world on 1 June 1979, and Alice followed her on 26 November 1981. The following excerpts from cables sent by the Universal House of Justice and by Abdu'l-Baha  Rfihiyyih KMnum upon the passing of Elizabeth and of Alice point to some of their sterling qualities and unforgettable services to the Cause of God:

 1886 — 1979  

Jean Hutchinson-Smith      

 was the Australian-born daughter of John and Margaret Lauder who, with a young family, left Scotland about 1880 to seek a new life in a new land, and settled in Sydney, Australia. 

 Jean was born in 1886 and was educated at Sydney Girls' High School — at that time, 1900, the oniy girls' high school in the State of New South Wales — and at the University of Sydney. She passed to the AbM Kingdom on 20 July 1979, in her ninety-third  year. 

 Jean was fifty-five when she found the Baha'i Faith and had been widowed for eight years, but her daughter, Alicia, feels that if they had both heard of the Faith at an earlier time her father would undoubtedly have embraced it, for breadth of thought was always apparent in the family. 

 Jean's life as a young, educated matron was filled with the difficulties caused by living for many years in backward country towns where her classically-educated husband was posted as a teacher. Some of her receptivity to the spiritual life must have been born of the combined effects of education and harsh living conditions. 

 She had a truly international outlook and was a sincere seeker after Truth. Her introduction to the Faith of Baha'u'llah through 

Stanley and Mariette       

 Bolton, and subsequently 'Father and Mother Dunn', was the climax of this long search. She became a Baha'i in March 1941. 
A letter from the beloved  

Guardian dated 22 January  

 1944 was her most cherished possession. In his own hand he had written: 'May the Beloved bless your devoted efforts, guide every step you take in His service, remove all obstacles from your path and fulfil every desire you cherish for the furtherance of the interests of His Faith.' 

 After she became a Baha'i she travelled extensively in the British Isles and Europe from 1948 until the early 1960s, neglecting no opportunity to meet with the friends in the many countries she visited. 

 Her gift for languages, particularly German and French, was a tremendous advantage. She was an able speaker and will long be remembered gratefully in Edinburgh where significant newspaper  publicity on the Faith followed a public meeting she addressed in that city. The Baha'is there had been trying for years to break into the press. Marion Hofman recalled this when she visited Jean in Sydney in 1977, so many years after the event, which must have taken place in 1948, the same year in which Jean and Alicia served as tellers when the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Dublin was formed in the home of 

George Townshend. Wherever 

 Jean's ship called she made contact with the believers. In 1959 she and Alicia visited Tokyo, the first Australian Baha'is to visit the Japanese Baha'i community. On two visits to Europe and the United Kingdom in the early 1960s Jean was tireless in promoting the Faith in company with Alicia. 

 'I wish to assure you of my loving and deep-felt appreciation  of your constant and manifold services to our beloved Faith,' the Guardian wrote in a postscript to a letter written on his behalf on 18 February 1950. 

 'I will supplicate the Beloved to bless continually your high endeavours, to remove every obstacle from your path, and enable you to win great victories for its institutions.' 

 The erection of the Baha'i Temple at

  Ingleside was the great thrill of Jean's Baha life. She had seen the Faith grow in numbers and strength to a degree that in the early days of rented meeting halls would have seemed a dream. She rejoiced in hearing prayers recited in her home in languages other than English, as testimony to the universality and growth of the Cause. During Marion Hofman's visit in 1977 Jean remarked how deeply she regretted not having had the privilege of making the pilgrimage to the World Centre due to the dates being fuiiy booked when she applied, and was comforted by Marion's reply, referring g to words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, in which lie expressed the thought that to be engaged in teaching the Cause is equivalent to having attained the Threshold (Tablet to Mariam 

Haney dated 18 October 1903).

 (FU'AD AHMADP(JR MILANL)   

 1922 — 1979  

Fu'~id Ahmadpiir Mfl6ni    

 (known as Fu'Ad A1~madpour) was born in 1922 in Tabrfz, IrAn. He was the eldest son of 'In~yat'u'116h 

Ab-madpiir  Mfl6ni. The    

 family, which was devoted, steadfast, deeply-rooted in the Baha'i Cause and of distinguished lineage, moved to TilirAn while Fu'dd was still in his childhood. 

 Fu'~d's paternal grandfather, HAjf A1~mad MilAni, was one of the early believers who recognized the Bab and Baha'u'llah. Following the martyrdom of the BTh, His remains were taken to Mil6n and kept for a time in the silk mill of H~.jf Ahmad.1 

 Fu'AI's maternal grandfather, Ibr4hfm Adhar Mirza, was an outstanding Baha'i teacher who, for a while, served 'Abdu'l-Baha as a scribe.

 inside a mosque. As he left the building he was attacked by fanatics who beat him with sticks and chains until he fell wounded and unconscious and was believed to be dead. He was taken to a hospital in TilirAn where his recovery was effected, though traces of his injuries remained on his face throughout his life. He studied at Tihr~n University and completed his education in Paris and Geneva, receiving a Ph.D. in Law. He made a pilgrimage  to the Holy Land and would often repeat what the Guardian said to him about his having followed in his father's footsteps in serving the 

Faith.                     

 Fu'6d Alimadpiir's service to the Cause was characterized by fearless courage. 

 He pioneered  to Morocco in 1955, setting an example of sacrifice and self-denial. 

 Tie opened his home to the friends and tirelessly travelled to visit the believers in every corner of the country. Not satisfied with ordinary feats or small achievements, he always sought perfection  and excellence. He was determined to win important goals in the administrative

IN MEMORIAM                683

  affairs of the Faith. 

 His fame grew: Baha'is and nonBahA'is, the 6lite and layman alike, would go to him for solutions to their problems.  He dealt with ease with people from all walks of life both within and without the Baha'i community. 

 The services of the friends aroused his deep admiration: a poor Baha'i giving a contribution or an illiterate friend teaching the Faith successfully would inspire him. 

 Nothing was capable of frightening him for he knew that all was worthless compared with the Cause, and in the light of its greatness he did not consider himself or his services of any significance. 

 He served on the National Spiritual Assembly  for almost twenty years and as an officer for many of these and, with his vast personal ability, carried the great responsibility of serving as liaison between the National Spiritual  Assembly and those who wished to contact it from inside or outside. 

 He arranged the meetings and carried out the decisions. 

 In the incident of al-N6d6r, when several Baha'is were imprisoned, he did everjthing in his power to exonerate them. 

 The name of Fu'6d Ahmadphr, whose services are an integral part of the achievements  in Morocco, will be recorded in letters of light in the history of the Faith in that region. 

 It is sufficient here to quote a passage from a letter written by Counsellor Muhammad  Kebdani to commemorate the passing of Mr. Ahmadp6r: 'To my dear servant-friend, the lion of God, Mr. Fu'6d Ahmadpiir: God's decree is that he be unexpectedly hidden from the eyes of the Baha'i friends in Morocco, the friends who loved him wholeheartedly. 

 He ascended to the Kingdom of God following a heart attack suffered on 2 August 1979 in London, and was buried close to the grave of his beloved Guardian whom he would frequently mention with tearful eyes.' 

 The following cablegram was received from the 

Universal House of Justice 

 praising his glorious services:

  Salih-bey, the grandfather of Sami Doktor-oglu,  was a distinguished and well-respected medical doctor who was employed at the palace of the Ottoman SultAn in Istanbul. He was known for his kindness and help to the poor. 

 His wife was related tothe family of the Sultan. 

 The family belonged to the Turkish Dervish order 

Bektashiyya Tariqat (Bakt~shi Tariqat).

 Their son, Jilalit-bey, an army officer,  was sent to Birecik where he met and married Emine KhAnum, a native of the town. In 1901 Sami was born to them. His parents moved back to Istanbul where he attended Robert College — a missionary school — and from his many Greek schoolmates acquired a mastery of their language. His education was interrupted at the outbreak of World War I. Not old enough to serve in the army, Sami was employed by the government as a translator, remaining in Istanbul until the end of the war. When civil unrest swept the country in 1920, the family moved back to Birecik where Sami again found work as a translator in a government  office. 

     The Baha'is of Birecik      

 were attracted to Sami's upright character and sought his assistance in providing translations of Baha'i newsletters and articles written in English which had been sent to them by friends abroad.

  Thus, Sami-bey was introduced to the Faith which he frequently discussed with 'Abdu'1-Qadir  Diri6z and eventually accepted. 

 In 1930 he married Behiye KlPnum, the daughter of a wellknown Baha family of Gliazi Antab. Five children were born of the union: Stiheyla, Siireyya, Erol BadP, Halde and Semura. 

 The couple settled in Mardin for two years and then moved to Diyarbakir, engaging in commerce in both places. 

 While they were in Mardin the Baha'i friends in Urfa, 

Adana and Ghazi Antab      

 were arrested and put on trial; some were imprisoned and their books were destroyed or confiscated. Sami-bey was also called to the police station but after being detained overnight and interrogated  he was set free. In 1938 he returned to Istanbul. 

Although the Local Spiritual

 Assembly  could not meet because the Faith was under proscription, the friends used to meet among themselves and share news of Baha'i activities around the world. In Istanbul he started a travel agency and in a short time was loved and admired for his trustworthiness, honesty and good character. 

 Saffli-bey was the sole heir to the Bekt4shiy-ya endowment, as well as other properties belonging to his grandparents, but he refused them all. 

 He loved the Baha'i Faith and had nothing to do with the administration of the Tariqat, though he would have gained a considerable income. 

 After th~ second World War he was invited to be the general representative of Pan American Airways which was extending its service for the first time to Turkey. Soon other airline companies offered him an agency. His was the first and only firm to be given such an offer. 

 In Turkish history books he is mentioned as the founder of travel agencies in Turkey. He was hardworking and deL:-mined.  Through his business he became well known to the authorities and the general population. 

 The visit to Istanbul in the winter of 1951 of Mrs. Amelia E. Collins (appointed a Hand of the 

Cause on 24 December       

 of that year) at the request of Shoghi Effendi marked the turning point in Sami's Baha'i life. He had been requested to make the necessary arrangements.  He made hotel reservations and greeted her at the airport with a large group of friends. Mrs. Collins's visit infused new life into the 

     Sami Doktoroglu            

  community. Several meetings were arranged at which she could meet the friends and a large banquet was given in her honour. 

 She conveyed messages from the beloved Guardian and extended his love. 

 While she was in Istanbul Sami received a cablegram from Shoghi Effendi inviting him to visit the Holy Land. 

 Thrilled and astonished, he proceeded to Haifa, and returned filled with renewed spirit and enthusiasm, his devotion to the Faith reinforced by his having been in the presence of the Guardian for whom he had great admiration and love. After his return a letter dated 14 December 1951 written on behalf of the Guardian reached the believers in Istanbul encouraging the frfends to establish  a Local Spiritual Assembly and to pursue other tasks concerning which he had given instructions to 

Sami.                      
  In April 1952 the first    

Local Spiritual Assembly   

 of Istanbul was formed with Sami as one of its members. He began to deepen his knowledge by reading Baha'i books in English, many of these as yet not available in Turkish, and making a special study of Shoghi 

Effendi's


<p685>
IN MEMORIAM                685

  God Passes By. Under the guidance of the Guardian with whom he was in frequent correspondence he implemented the delicate negotiations for the identification and purchase  of the Holy Places in Istanbul and Ed-irne  associated with the presence of Baha'u'llah. 

 At a later time, writing of his pilgrimage to the Hoiy Land in 1951, he said of Shoghi Effendi, 'I never imagined his bestowing upon me so many bounties, even one of which would be sufficient to make me happy throughout eternity. I am still unable to realize the blessings bestowed upon me, none of which I have deserved.' 

 Many pioneers arose in 1952, settling in all parts of the world, in answer to the call of the Guardian. 

 Sami was of great assistance to the Persian friends, many of whom knew of his travel agency, and he tendered practical help in their relocation. 

 In 1953 he took delight in attending the International Conferences held in Stockholm, Kampala and New Delhi, and was present at the dedication of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Wilmette. At these gatherings  he met many believers from all parts of the world and experienced a fuller appreciation of the reality of membership in the Baha'i world community. 

 Later he was privileged to attend the Wodd Congress in London and to participate in the first International Convention for the election of the 

Universal House of Justice.

 He served as a member of the Auxiliary Board and was the trustee of the Huqfiqu'11Th in Turkey. 

 In 1957, not long before the passing of Shoghi Effendi, he conducted the long search which resulted in the acquisition of the site for the future 

Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. When   

 the friends in Ankara were jailed in 1960 and questioned about their beliefs, and had their books taken from them, Sami contacted high-ranking government officials and addressed a letter to the President of Turkey explaining that the Baha Faith is an independent religion and not a sect of Ishm. The friends defended themselves admirably in court and Were released. 

 He was the author of Diiya Medeniyetinin dogu~u (Dawning of a World Civilization), and of an introductory pamphlet entitled The Baha'i Religion, and he compiled and translated a book called Bekienen Qig. His works were popular among the friends. He sent copies of his works to the then Prime Minister, Mr. Nihat Erim, from whom he received a wann letter of acknowledgement,  as well as to other high-ranking officials. 

 He was successful in obtaining permission to search the government archives for various documents related to the Ministry of Baha'u'llah. Among his findings was an indication, hitherto unknown, that Mulla 'Aliy-i-Bast6mi, one of the Letters of the Living, the first martyr of the Bab Dispensation, who was put to death in 'Iraq, had in his travels reached the city of Bolu, east of Istanbul. 

 In 1977, despite his age and the condition of his health, he accepted an invitation from the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia to spend two months teaching in that country. In 1978 he visited Cyprus twice as a travelling teacher. 

 The death of his dearly loved sister, Hay-riye Kh6num who had~ married his Baha'i teacher, 'Abdu'1-Qadir Diridz, affected him deeply, as she was the only member of his family who accepted the Faith. Indeed, the others considered him an infidel. 

 Although not an educated woman she had immersed herself in the teachings, gained a great knowledge  of the Faith and was an excellent and valued teacher of the Cause. 

 The Universal House of Justice had requested Sami to make inquiries about the possibility of shipping lumber from Turkey for the restoration of Holy Places in 'Akka. 

 The last letter from the House of Justice reached him late in July of 1979. 

 On 31 July, while giving instructions to his daughter, Stiheyla, to accomplish the instructions of the Supreme Body, he partially lost consciousness. Three days later he was taken to the hospital and on 4 August he passed to the 

Abh~i Kingdom.            

 A letter of consolation addressed to the family in October 1979 by the beloved Hand of the Cause 

Abdu'l-Baha R6hfyyih      

 Kh6num brought the sweet solace of these words: 'Our beloved Guardian esteemed your father very highly and I am sure his reward in the Abki Kingdom is very great. He will be much missed by the believers in Turkey and indeed in many countries where the friends were a witness to his many services to the Faith.'

 1927 — 1979 of people on tiny atolls and larger land masses scattered throughout the Pacific. 

 For many years Mosese served on the Local 

     Spiritual     
Assembly      

 of Nuku'alof a and he travelled the length and breadth of Tonga in search of waiting souls. 

 He donated for the site of the national 

Ilaziratu'1-Quds

 half of the small piece of land he owned in the centre of 

     Nuku'alofa    

 and lived with his family on the A     othei portion. 

 His home was always open to the local Baha'i friends and to the many visitors from overseas: all found a warm wekome there. 

 In July 1968, when he was appointed to the Auxiliary Board, he wrote to the Continental Board of Counsellors: 'I am very happy indeed to accept your call and I am praying that the Blessed Beauty will lead me and guide me to teach 

His Cause     

 in this field and to win many victories for our glorious 

Faith.' Mosese

 joined Gina and Russ Garcia on board their vessel Dawnbreaker for an extensive teaching trip which took them through the islands of Fiji, Tonga and 

Samoa. They   

 visited a number of outer islands and called at many villages. 

 Mosese was the first Pacific Islander to undertake teaching trips of long duration. His wife and children saw him but rarely as he journeyed, under the guidance of the Counsellors and various 

National      

 Spiritual Assemblies, to Kiribati and Tuvalu; Niue; the 

Solomon Islands;
New Guinea;   

 the Marshall, Mariana and 

Caroline      
Islands;      
Nauru; Australia

 and New Zealand, to name but some of his destinations. 

 His gentle and enthusiastic soul always attracted listeners, and to many a lonely and isolated believer he brought love and a renewed spirit. In 

New Zealand   

 he spearheaded teaching among the Maoris, walking countless miles to meet them, staying on their maraes, and often working with them on their farms. He visited, as well, Hawaii, Alaska and the continental 

United States.

 Mosese's luminous spirit, happy personality and enthusiastic manner of teaching endeared him to friends and strangers alike. He had a ready smile and a deep and natural sense of hospitality. 

 He was always positive in his approach, respecting the views of others and encouraging and supporting them. To him the Faith was sublime and when the demands on his time became too great he resigned his

  It was in the early years of the Ten Year Crusade that Mosese Hokafonu, who lived on the island of Tongatapu in the Kingdom of Tonga, first heard of the Baha'i Faith. He became deeply attracted, readily embraced it, and for the remainder of his life was one of its staunch supporters and outstanding teachers. The flame of love that was ignited in his heart never dimmed. He brought knowledge of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah to many hundreds

  government job to devote the rest of his life to serving the Cause. 

 Tile moved with his family from their home in town to a small house in a village where they lived a simple life. He developed a strong band of assistants who aided him in his Auxiliary Board work. 

 Many of his coworkers learned of his last illness only when they arrived in Tonga for a meeting of the Auxiliary Board attended by members from Tonga, Fiji and Samoa, all the arrangements for which Mosese had undertaken in spite of ill health. 

 At the end of the meeting he was admitted to hospital. 

 His afifiction had taken its toll and he passed to the Abha Kingdom on 28 August 1979. Baron Vaca, a wellknown Tongan noble, a relative who greatly respected and admired Mosese, conducted the funeral service which was attended  by many hundreds of people. Mosese is survived by his equally devoted wife, Ofa, and five children. The feats achieved by this devoted servant of Baha'u'llah in the Pacific region bring to mind the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha: Baha:   0 that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of 'Y4 Bahd'u'1-Abhd'  in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the Divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! 

 Please God, ye may achieve it.'

    MELBA M. CALL KING         

 1910 — 1979 A casual observer might assume mistakenly that Melba King lived in a limited and narrow world of darkness, for she was blind. But those who were privileged to share her world know that she lived in beauty and light, her horizons uncircumscribed by physical limitations. 

 A Yupik Eskimo, she was born on 11 October  1910 in the village of Savanaska in the Bristol Bay region of Alaska. Orphaned at an early age and physically handicapped, she might have been lost had it not been for Dr. French, a United States Commissioner, who took an interest in her welfare and assisted 1 Tablets of the Divine Plan, p. 39. 

 with planning for her physical and educational needs. 

 She was reared by a white foster-mother,  Corrine Call, a teacher for the 

Alaskan  Indian Service.  

 Melba earned her way through college, attended the School for the Blind at Vancouver,  Washington, and studied at Perkins Institute in Massachusetts. Later she completed  two years' study at Washington University and an additional two years' study at Central 

Washington University.     

 She was the first blind student ever to graduate from that University. 

 Her diploma was presented to her by the Governor of the State of Washington, the Hon. William Langley. 

 Determined to help others to broaden their perspective through education, Melba accepted  a position teaching newly-blind adults in New Mexico. It was there that she met Kathryn Franklin2 who introduced her to the Baha Faith, an event that was to change the course of her life. Melba declared her belief in Baha'u'llah on 23 May 1943 in Albuquerque, New Mexico — the first full-blooded Eskimo to do so.3 This occasion, unforgettable for Melba and significant for the Faith, was made more memorable by a letter written on the Guardian's behalf by his secretary on 24 July in which he predicted a radiant future for Melba and for her people. In his own hand Shoghi Effendi wrote, 'Your most welcome letter has rejoiced my heart. 

 I extend to you a most hearty welcome into the ranks of the followers of Baha'u'llah, and will greatly value your support and cooperation. 

 Your conversion to His Cause is indeed an historic event, and will greatly rejoice the hearts of the believers. I will pray for your success and spiritual advancement from the depths of my heart. Rest assured and be confident.' 

 To teach the Faith among the Eskimos became her greatest hope. 

 She returned to Seattle, Washington, in May 1944 and attended the Washington State Training Center for the Blind where she met Eugene King. They were married on 

30 September 1944.         

 Humility was an integral part of Melba's personality. 

 She was a determined and completely  honest champion of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, never hesitating to speak out

  to prevent misunderstandings or misrepresentations. 

 As an active member of numerous Local Spiritual Assemblies she was to become adept in the art of consultation. Unafraid of controversy, she believed that all the facts were necessary to full and frank consultation, and encouraged everyone to express his opinion as openly as she did. Outstanding among her gifts was that of love which she extended to Baha'is and non-BahA'fs alike. She was an accomplished pianist and often performed at public meetings. She was, as well, a skilled secretary, and a competent speaker and teacher. Her teaching trips were numerous and varied. She, Eugene and her gentle guide-dog became a familiar sight throughout Alaska, Oregon, California and Washington. She taught on Indian Reservations and at Baha'i summer schoojs from Geyserville, California, to Juneau, Alaska. She served on the committee that launched the first mass teaching effort in Washington which reached nearly three thousand people, and made repeated visits to teach the Yakima and Tulalip Indians on their reservations. Melba and Eugene were the first public speakers in an Indian community at Neah Bay, Washington. In addition to her dedicated  and varied services as a member of the Local Spiritual 

Assemblies of Tacoma       

 and Seattle she served on the National Baha Committee for the Blind. 

 Throughout her many years of service in the Baha communities of Washington, part of Melba's heart yearned for her native Alaska. In 1969 she and Eugene moved to Juneau and soon endeared th~mse1ves to the entire Alaskan 

Baha'i community. Despite  

 difficult weather conditions and precarious health they served on the Local 

Spiritual Assembly of Juneau

 and its numerous committees, did extensive teaching throughout the country, and helped build and strengthen the Juneau community before moving to Anchorage in 1971, a move which became necessary because  of the need for access to medical facilities. 

 Melba also served on the National Teaching and National Goals Committees. 

 In 1972 iii health forced the Kings to relocate in the milder climate of Washington. They were able to attend the 1976 International Conference  in Anchorage, following which they made a teaching trip into the central and northern regions of Alaska. In July 1978 they made a teaching trip to Sitka and formulated plans to settle again in Alaska, this time in Haines. But it was not to be. On 7 September 1979, after a year of puzzling illness, Melba was called to her greater home in the Abhd Kingdom, leaving us very blessed for having shared her world of infinite vision. 

 She was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Seattle. On

IN MEMORIAM                689

LUDMILA VAN SOMBEEK        

 1893 — 1979 Certain moments are emblematic of a lifetime.  One evening in Durham, North Carolina, in the 1960s, a period of civil rights conflict in the southern United 

States, Ludmila Van Sombeek

 circulated among a large, happy, multiracial gathering in her home, speaking of the beauty of unity in diversity, the significance of this century, and the mission of Baha'u'llah. 

 She paused momentarily to place a pillow at the back of an African student who had spent a weekend in her home recuperating from months in hospital. 

 Without  pausing in sharing the Baha'i Message, she brought comfort to one in need. This gesture exemplified her life of ceaseless teaching of the Faith in words and, inseparably, in thoughtful and deeply caring service to those of all races, nationalities and strata of society. 

 Born Ludmila Ott on 30 July 1893 in Vienna, Austria, she experienced eady the feelings of a minority. 

 She attended a Lutheran school in predominantly Catholic Vienna. In 1916 she sailed to the United States, her parents fearing that she would not have the opportunity for education in wartorn Europe. In New York she studied nursing at the Jewish 

Training School, Brooklyn  

 Hospital. Enduring language difficulties, heavy work and diphtheria sensitized her to the needs of those experiencing isolation, prejudice and despair. 

 Her adoption of a sickly baby and of a foundling, after her marriage to Adolph George Bechtold, were an expression of this understanding. In this period she attended firesides at the home of Antoinette 

'Aunty' Foote in Brooklyn  

 and, in 1922, became a devout Baha'i. 

 After the death of her husband, Ludmila studied optics and business management and served as president of Beclitold Optical Company  for ten years before retiring to devote her energies to sharing the Message and to engaging in human relations activities. 

 The organizations with which she became most actively involved were ones focusing on America's 'most challenging issue'. For her, the National Association for the Advancement of 

Colored People in New      

 York, and the Urban League in Harlem, became centers for action and for relating the spiritual message to 

   Ludmila Van Sombeek        

  the cause of justice and harmony. She became a friend of Mary White Ovington, one of the founders of the N.A.A.C.P.; of Walter White, its longtime executive secretary; of George Schuyler, the Pittsburgh Courier columnist, and of many other humanitarians. 

 Ludmila's participation in the work of various civic and religious organizations provided many opportunities to speak of the Faith and to promote unity. 

 She was invited to speak to college audiences in Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Alabama, and often addressed organizations working for inter-religious understanding. 

 On one trip in the north, Ludmila met Matthew Bullock, a Nack lawyet, chairman of the Massachusetts 

Parole Board and Advisory  

 Board of Pardons, and president  of the Community 

Church of Boston. Ludmila's

 answers to his questions and her friendship over many years led him to accept the Faith in 1940. 

 Her home was always open; often thirty guests would dine and enjoy music and experience the joy of diversity. 

 With her marriage to Georg Van Sombeek another chapter in Ludmila's life began. They moved as pioneers to Durham, North Carolina. 

 In the south, as in the north, Ludmila concentrated on the improvement of race relations through guest recitals at


<p690>
690                 THE )BAHA'I WORLD

  her grand piano, dinner parties and literary evenings. 

 In addition she addressed many church groups, university audiences and civic organizations. 

 She became active in the International League for Peace and Freedom, the National Council for Negro Women, the Y.W.C.A., the Business and Professional Women's 

Club, the Durham Committee 

 on Negro Affairs, and resumed her longtime activity  with the N.A.A.C.P. Traveling throughout the south, she was in Montgomery, Alabama, when the boycott of 1955 — 1956 was at its height. She befriended the Martin Luther King family. She frequently worked eighteen hours a day visiting the sick, offering gifts to the needy, comfort to the desolate, sweets to neighborhood children. The formation of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Durham in 1962 was an achievement for which she had labored diligently. 

 A profound spiritual commitment followed her pilgrimage in 1953 when she met the Guardian. Shoghi Effendi's request that she visit countries behind the Iron Curtain was answered by her 1958, 1963, 1965 and 1967 trips to Czechoslovakia, 

Hungary and Bulgaria      

 and, until she became incapacitated, by her correspondence with many friends living there. 

 In these countries she visited friends who had heard of the Faith through Martha Root and spoke with people from all walks of life. She was fluent in German and Czech and had studied Esperanto. She spoke at Austrian and French Baha'i schools and firesides in Europe; attended the 

International Conference  

 in Kampala, Uganda, in 1953 and did some teaching in Africa; toured Russia in 1958; made a pilgrimage to Ir6n in 1967 and addressed an audience of 400 Baha'i college students; traveled to Panama, the Virgin Islands and, in the continental 

United States, from Maine  

 to California — each journey providing  opportunities to speak, show slides, inspire action. 

 Ludmiila was active in Baha institutions through the years. She was a member of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly of New York       

 City in the 1930s and of Durham, North Carolina, from 1962 until 1969 when she moyed west. She served on the Africa Teaching 

Committee,  the Interracial

 Service Committee and was active in teaching children and youth at Baha'i summer schools. 

 What was the power of this remarkable woman? 

 A fervent commitment to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, an unwavering belief in the efficacy of prayer, a creative approach to living that mobilized all her experiences and talents in teaching the Faith, and a remarkable  balance between sharing the Word and serving humankind. 

 In its cable at the time of her death on 7 September 1979 in Phoenix, Arizona, the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States deplored the loss of this INDOMITABLE TEACHER and expressed admiration of her FEARLESS PROMOTION

 This loss was also contributory to the future course of his life, thoughts and feelings. When he was just twenty he enlisted in the Army and remained in active service for almost three decades. 

 He was a prisoner of war during part of World

 In 1940 he married Muhik PirmurAdiyAn. This gave another wing to his soul which had already been in the service of the Cause of Baha'u'llah for a few years during which he had read in Persian and Arabic most of the numerous Baha'i books and writings his father kept in his large personal library.

  was a staunch believer and following their marriage Riil)u'11Th's activities increased. I well remember their fireside meetings in LsfahTh which were attended by people from all walks of life including mullas and professors. 

 Teaching enquirers, and teaching their children, were their principal aims in life. 

 In response to the constant appeals for pioneers which the beloved Guardian had raised in his messages, he resigned his rank of Colonel and, in consultation with the National Teaching Committee of Iran, settled in Spain in October 1958 with his wife and five children (the youngest, one year of age, the eldest fifteen) .They had no knowledge of the language  nor of the circumstances obtaining in their chosen goal. Many were the members of his family who neither understood nor approved of his decision. From the moment they arrived they dedicated themselves to teaching the Faith. 

 I vividly remember him attempting to teach some friends who knew little French, using his two dictionaries, French — Iranian and French — Spanish. After spending nine months in Barcelona he moved with his family to MaHorca to assist with the formation of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly.                 

 Three years later the family pioneered once more, this time to Granada where there had been no Baha'is before. The dream of opening  a town to the Faith was at last a reality. Soon firesides were organized and were attended  by an increasing number; in this way local people began to embrace the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 He lived to see a well-established Baha community in Granada with many local believers and an active and functioning Local 

Spiritual Assembly.       

 In 1975 he was elected a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Spain, and in 1978 was privileged to attend the fourth International Convention for the election of the Universal House of Justice. He led a group of Baha'i youth on a teaching trip of several weeks' duration in Ireland and travelled thousands of miles across Spain giving public talks and carrying out different tasks in service to the Cause. 

 During the last two years of his life he served as National Treasurer of the Spanish Baha'i community. 

 Mr. Egea Martinez wrote of him in an article published in the national Baha'i bulletin  of Spain: 'I had the honour of being his friend and of accompanying him for the thousands of kilometres we travelled in his car, always at the service of the Faith He was a great father, teacher and a good friend. He taught the Faith with firm authenticity and no compromises, no matter who his listeners were. 

 Until the last few weeks of his life, although weak and ill, he remained active in the service of the Cause. This indeed was his last example of total commitment to the Faith he so ardently loved We have lost our father, a loving friend and an outstanding teacher.

  People seldom succeed in rounding out their own destiny, in fulfilling, even to a minor degree, their own potentiality. 

Not so Gladys Weeden.     

 Of Swedish grandparents who had sought freedom of religious outlook in the New World, she was about five years old when her mother died in childbirth with the baby and Gladys's father found his burdens too heavy and disappeared; her mother's sister, Mrs. Anderson, legally adopted her; Gladys went to school until she finished eighth grade but her aunt now had children of her own and the cruel years of the great economic depression  forced her to go to work; Gladys stayed at home to keep house and mind her much younger brother and sister. 

 I can remember nothing easy in Gladys's life; at sixteen, when the children were older, Gladys got her first job as salesgirl in a stote. 

 It is no exaggeration to state that she worked hard, all her life, until she died, a fact which certainly produced in her a strong and wonderful character. Raised in a strict Baptist atmosphere, she recalled that its church and Sunday school had made no deep impression on her. In her own words, it was not until the years of the Depression, in 1919, that people began to reevaluate their lives there was a lack of everything, money in particular we realized that the material things were no support I began to start my spiritual thinking.' She was twenty-three years old. 

 Even to purchase petrol for an outing was a rare luxury, but on a sunny July day in 1932 Gladys and her husband, Frank Cotton, whom she had married in 1925, and from whom she was divorced in 1941, went on a day's excursion to the White 

Mountains in New Hampshire
with another couple.      

I (then Mary Maxwell)     

 and Rosemary Sala1 were motoring from Montreal to Green Acre in Eliot, Maine, and we all met at a sightseeing spot called Lost River. Years later 

Rosemary told Gladys      

 that I had said to her: 'That girl is going to become a Baha.' Thus began a very deep friendship that lasted forty-seven years. 

 Gladys came to see me in Green Acre and her first reaction — on seeing Baha'is of different races — was, '0 Lord, this is a religious place!' 

 But the new friendship held firm and, combined with the love and teaching of my mother, May Maxwell, eventually brought Gladys into the Faith. She lived and worked in Haverhill, Massachusetts, but we met again at Green Acre in 1933 and also corresponded; a letter of mine to her, in 1934, seems to forecast the future: K I feet you and I need each other in life as friends When you spoke this summer of that feeling you have, that some day there is something great for you to do, I know you are right and I know you will do it. Who knows, perhaps our paths lie together in some great service? 
I feel they do.'          

 Although Gladys did not become an enrolled  Baha until January 1937 in Worcester, Massachusetts, from the very beginning she blossomed in love for the Faith. In November 1935 she wrote her first spontaneous letter to Shoghi Effendi. In his reply the Guardian urges her to study the Teachings and prepare herself for 'intensive work in the field of teaching', and in his own handwriting assures her of 'my loving prayers for your spiritual advancement and for the complete realization of your highest hopes in the service of our beloved Faith may your endeavours be richly blessed by 

Baha'u'llah.' Before      
Gladys left Haverhill     

 for Worcester she was already holding a we~k1y meeting for a few friends; in Worcester she taught the teenage children's class, telling me in one of her letters: 'I have so much love to give and I just lavish it all on them. I wish they were all mine.' A letter was duly sent to Shoghi Effendi about this activity and in his own writing he assures her: 'The clear evidences of your accomplishments in the service of our glorious Faith greatly 1 See In Memoriam', p. 713.

  hearten me in my task. 

 I am so glad to observe the signs of your activity, devotion and progress in promoting the interests of our beloved Cause. 

 I wish you to persevere, nay to redouble your efforts, and not to feel disheartened under any circumstances .' This postscript  became her mandate; to it she clung through thick and thin until her death. 

     During those Worcester     

 years, because Gladys was devoted, creative and industrious, her Baha'i activities steadily increased: she obtained publicity, organized new occasions for teaching enquirers, served on the Local Assembly, was appointed to the 

Regional Teaching Committee
of the six New England States.

 She always aspired to new heights in her personal life; 'I have been attending a public speaking class all winter,' she wrote to me, and it has helped me a great deal. I have also tried to improve my English and increase my vocabulary.' 

 Her longing to go forth and teach was steadily growing; once it was a dream that we two would go to Haiti; later it was Cuba and she started learning Spanish; as early as 1935 she wrote to me: 'We would like to curl up in some remote place for an indefinite stay, but our Baha'i conscience will not let us. Life would hold no meaning if we could not feel we were doing something for the Faith. 

 you know darling I am going to do something, I am so positive of it Her chance came in 1942; during a Regional Committee meeting the urgent call for pioneers  was raised; Gladys wrote to me, 'Out popped the words     11 go anywhere you want me to!' The goal of the Seven Year Plan — which would end in 1944 — was to establish a Local Assembly in each State of the Union. 

 She was stunned by her audacity and thrilled at her chance! On 18 February 1942 she was installed as a pioneer in Brattle-boro,  Vermont, with no need to take a job for the first three months so she could devote full time to teaching: 'I go out to walk and say the Greatest Name on every route I take This further great step in her Baha life opened the door to many blessings. 

 By April 1943 she had her Assembly and was on it; this new Assembly came forth,' she wrote to me, 'very much like the birth of a child With joy, pain and heartache. After the birth comes the responsibility of the child's future welfare and guidance.' 

 In September a man she was greatly attracted to accepted the Faith; he was Benjamin Dunham Weeden,1 her future husband, a man with a singularly sweet nature, a cultured gentlemanly person who became a very convinced  Baha'i and who, in the twenty-two years of their marriage, brought her much happiness. By 1945 Gladys was chairman of the Brattleboro Assembly, 

Ben secretary. The Cause   

 was well established there but Gladys was not satisfied or happy; her task seemed accomplished but her relation to Ben was static, with no marriage in prospect. Again she reached out to me, as she had many times since 

I left North America       

 in 1935, and wanted to meet me somewhere, anywhere, for a few weeks. My own responsibilities were crushing; my father, then seventy-one, was designing the superstructure of the Bab's Shrine and trying tb carry on additional tasks for Shoghi Effendi who was very alone and very overworked himself at that difficult period in our lives. When he saw that Gladys was free, supposedly, of personal ties, wanted

  to leave Brattleboro for good and was longing to be with me, he came and stood by my bed one day when I was ill and said, 'You can't go on like this', and then asked if I thought Gladys would be willing to come to me and serve in Haifa. 

 On 4 February 1947 she wrote that my cable inviting her to come to Haifa had been received and she was in a dizzy whirl: 'Had a fairy godmother given me a wish that was dearest to the heart, the news in your cable fulfilled it!' On the morning of 30 March she was met in the Port of Haifa by my father, Sutherland Maxwell, and brought to the Western Baha'i Pilgrim House which was to be her home for almost five years — years of great civil turbulence in what was then Palestine  but soon became Israel, years when the Baha'i pilgrimage was suspended. After praying  in the Shrines, that same afternoon Gladys met the Guardian in the drawing-room of the Master's house; as usual, I was present. 

 She had thought she might be called upon to help me in domestic duties and be my companion, but the Head of her Faith, sittiiig opposite her, welcoming her warmly, making her feel completely at ease and at home with him', had other ideas. She was never to forget 'the beauty of his face' or the 'resonant voice' or that 'it was just like a bubbling stream to hear him laugh' — or that 'Shoghi Effendi never did the possible, he always did the impossible, and he expected you to do that too'. It now seemed to Gladys this was what was expected of her! Next morning Mr. Maxwell would take her downtown and introduce her to various key ~peop1e, the eventual range of which included dealing with not oniy our local law firm, our bank and various business firms, but the local city and government officers of Haifa and 'Akka, as well as high-ranking officials in Jerusalem. 

 In 1938 she had written to me, 'my lack of education pops up to disturb me' — but it did not disturb the Guardian who used her many capacities, and her willingness, to great advantage. 

 The first months, at four o'clock every afternoon, Gladys reported to the Guardian. 'I will always give you a plan of guidance,? 

 she says he told her, 'if you find that you are unable to carry out this plan, you must report to me in detail and I will give you another plan ... 

 but you must always tell me the truth.' Sometimes there were things to report which she knew would distress him and then these words were her protection, for her heart ached to have to add bad news to his burdens. 

 The feelings of Mr. Weeden — combined with a legacy that put him in a better financial position to marry — now came to a head; the upshot was that he would come to Haifa and be of assistance to Mr. Maxwell in building the Shrine. They were married on 20 March 1948 in Jerusalem. 

 Ben was a distinguished-looking man; Gladys had a handsome, upright figure and always looked exceptionally neat and attractive. Together they attended many official functions, sometimes representing Shoghi Effendi, as well as social functions connected with the American Consul in Haifa and other prominent people. Gladys had a real gift for friendship and did a great deal, in the new State, to back up the esteem in which the Head of the Faith was already held. I was sad that Ben's health should become the cause of their returning to America just as our local Baha'i life entered a new and wonderful phase. During 

November 1950 Shoghi      

 Effendi invited five members of what was to be the future International Baha Council to come and serve in the Holy 

Land: Lutfu'llhh          

 klakfm, Jessie and Ethel Revel!, then Mason Remey, and Amelia Collins all arrived in Haifa before Gladys and Ben left at the end of February 1951, the idea being that they would go back for Ben's medical treatment and return later to Haifa. The Guardian — who for the first time since pilgrimage had been suspended before the war, resumed his custom  of having a meal at the Pilgrim House table — announced to us all that we were members of the new and historic Council he was forming; Gladys's and Ben's membership remained in abeyance until it later became clear that they would no longer be serving in the Holy 

Land.                     

 Gladys then suffered the greatest test of her life: Ben was very run down, and she adored him. On the other hand there had been no time, nor indeed necessity, as they were supposedly returning, to hand over all the Guardian's highly involved work to the newcomers.  When Gladys wrote making it clear that because of Ben's condition they would not be coming back, Shoghi Effendi immediately cabled her, on March eighteenth, BEN SHOULD

  Gladys's love for the Faith, her loyalty to the Guardian, the self-discipline a hard life with many sorrows had taught her, now came to her rescue; she left Ben and returned alone. So that summer of 1951 Gladys was still the trusted postman; she held the affairs at the World Centre firmly in hand during Shoghi Effendi's absence; she not only assisted the new coworkers to understand the work, the restrictions and responsibilities of the World Centre, but launched them socially in Haifa through her good public relations and many friendships. 

     In November the Guardian   

 and I returned to Haifa and she rejoined her Ben who was in good spirits and greatly improved in health. Serving the Cause becomes a habit, indeed it should become a habit. Gladys and Ben now offered their services to the American National Spiritual Assembly; after meeting with them it was agreed they would tour the country and stimulate the Baha'is during the final year of their second 

Seven Year Plan. Gladys    

 wrote to me on 2 April 1952, 'We both feel we should do what we can to help this homefront situation.' They bought a car, motored to all forty-eight States of the Union and visited the friends in seventy-five major Baha'i communities! 

 By December they were tired out and withdrew to Vermont, but the National Teaching Committee requested them to help out in Greensboro, North Carolina, to which they retired to recover and to serve. 

 In April 1953 we met at the Centenary celebrations and inauguration of the 

Guardian's  great Ten     

 Year Plan; in July Dorothy Baker, the Hand of the Cause and an old friend, wrote them suggesting they pioneer to the West Indies which, she assured them, was 'just ready to pop if you act, act fast 

On 16 October the Weedens  

 arrived in Antigua, a tiny island in the Leeward group of the Caribbean; everything was very unfortunate: there had been terrible drought; prices were prohibitive; far from living, as they had been assured, on their income, they faced a heavy annual deficit; housing was astronomically  dear; their hotel was about to go into season' prices of thirty per cent increase. 

 After two months they left — 'to lick our spiritual wounds and straighten out our financial  debts', as Gladys wrote me. Nevertheless, they received the immortal title of Knights of Baha'u'llah. 

 Tired and discouraged, they settled in Henniker, New Hampshire, a very small New England town where Ben was to live sixteen years and Gladys twenty-five. 

 It was the end of their spectacular services, a fact which weighed heavily on Gladys. 

 Ben, who was fourteen years Gladys's senior, died in 1970 after an illness that had been harrowing for both of them. Gladys wrote to me, 'After I have made my adjustment  to this loss, I know there is plenty for me to do Her gift for speaking led to many invitations to give courses in Baha Summer Schools, very often on the subject of the Guardian and her years of service in Haifa. Our own deep friendship never failed us; in 1973, after an absence of three years and ten months, I found that the Master's house needed radical renovation and asked her to come and help me. Although we had met during my visits to America and at the dedication of the Panama Temple, this was her first return to Haifa since the days of the beloved Guardian. 

 She stayed almost five months; we both worked very hard and very happily together; when she left I wrote to her that 'no words from either of us could express what it had meant'. 

 In 19741 was able to spend a few days in her home in Ilenniker and always hoped to repeat it for a longer visit. Again in the spring of 1977 Gladys returned to Haifa, this time for a much shorter visit. During the last years of her life she kept busy, going twice to Vancouver, visiting the Alaskan Baha'is for a month, paying her respects at Shoghi Effendi's grave in London, going on a trip to Ireland, giving courses at Summer Schools. In the winter of 1977 — 1978 she spent some months in Wilmette at the invitation of the American National Assembly to help out on a long backlog of letters. In June 1979 she wrote to me: 'I don't feel old but I am now in my seventy-fourth year and that makes you realize that eighty is the next landmark, heavens!. I keep happy and contented even though I miss my dearest Ben more as the years roll by 'In September at the suggestion of the National Assembly she went to speak on the Guardian at a

       ALLAN RAYNOR               

 1910 — 1979 Allan Raynor's legacy was formed with the tools of integrity, concentration and obedience.  Long after the thousands of Allan's students and friends have themselves found their own ways to the Abh4 Kingdom, the Canadian Baha'i community will still be building  on the foundations of his achievements. 

    Allan Frederick Raynor     

 was the eldest of four children. He was born in Toronto, Canada, at midnight on 31 August 

1910 of Anglo-Irish Protestant

 ancestry. His father, Fred, a hardworking merchant, was a stern disciplinarian. 

 His mother, Bertha, instilled in her children a profound respect and love for God and His worship. Both Allan and his younger sister, Joyce, were in time privileged to recognize the station of Baha'u'llah. 

 Allan's early years were difficult, beset by illnesses and the economic crisis of the late 1920s. He left school for a secure job at Toronto City Hall where he stayed for seven years. 

 In 1936 a new opportunity offered itself which was to change the course of his life. He won a job as a door-to-door life insurance salesman in Ottawa and worked in both Ontario and Quebec. 

 Many of his clients were French Canadians, so he learned enough French to do his job. Despite the trauma of the sudden death of his father in 1937 he was able to concentrate on self education. He had already studied business administration by correspondence, and now he prepared for his professional designation. 

Chartered Life Underwriter.

 So successful was he in his new business that he soon came to the attention of senior company management. 

 Among those managers was one John A. Robarts who was looking for bright, enthusiastic recruits. 

 Allan was transferred back to Toronto in 1937. 

 In time he became a founder of the Estate Planning Institute of Canada and gained wide 

Allan Raynor               

 / recognition for his dedication, sincerity and integrity. 

 His first acquaintance with Baha was in 1934 at a gathering organized by W. 1. Christie of Parry Sound in northern Ontario. It was there that he met 

Lloyd Gardner.             

 In 1942 Allan met and married Evelyn Marie Johnson, daughter of a mixed Protestant —  Catholic family of Toronto merchants. 

 In that same year he joined the Canadian Army. Allan had been strong and healthy. 

 However, a blood infection attacked his ears which had already been weakened by the scarlet fever of his youth, and he was discharged from the Army with only ten per cent hearing. 

 Allan sought to aid his fellows. He was so concerned with the effects of alcohol on both fellow soldiers and friends that he travelled to New York City to research, then became a founder and active member of Alcoholics Anonymous in Toronto. Throughout his life he continued to be singularly generous not only with his time but with his earnings. 

 Throughout this period of early testing, Allan was sustained by his new friend and manager, John A. Robarts, who stepped into a role which Allan's own father had never


<p697>
IN MEMORIAM                697

  really known how to fill. 

 John and Allan spent many evenings together, Allan unburdening himself and John listening, waiting, counsel-lung  and offering encouragement. 

 In 1945 the war ended, an important year for Allan who recognized that 'I had no religion for my newborn son and I thought I should have one'. During a visit to the Robarts' home he asked to borrow a Baha'i book. 

 While John sought out just the right one for his dearly loved friend, Allan began to read a book of Baha pray&rs. In those few words he recognized the Voice of God. No more reading was necessary — Allan had found his Lord. 

 Allan's enthusiasm could never be ignored, least of all by his wife. Evelyn was challenged by this new belief. When she was forced to stop teaching Sunday School beeftuse her husband was considered to be a 'pagan', Evelyn accepted the challenge. 

 She studied by herself and then accepted the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, contributing both a fresh and vigorous presence to the Canadian Baha community and an outstanding example of warmth and hospitality. 

Together, Allan and Evelyn 

 joined the Gardners, George Spend-love  and others to form the first Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of North York, a borough of Toronto. 

 The tragic loss of an infant daughter, Susan, in 1952 marked Allan deeply but a healing compensation arrived with the birth of first Bruce, then Rosemary, to keep Doug and John company. 

 In 1945 Allan was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Canada. It was then that he began to make sterling contributions to Baha life in Canada. 

 During this period from 1954 to 1960 he served the National Assembly as vice-chairman and additionally chaired the National 

Teaching Committee. He     

 again served on the National Spiritual Assembly in 1963 — 1964. 

 It was also during this period that his intense need to understand as much as he could began to stimulate so many others. 

Study at Canadian Summer   

 Schools took on a special meaning when Allan was there to ask, 'On what page of the Writings did you find that?' Many youth of that and later periods attracted his attention,  his patience and his very generous devotion to ensure their fullest possible understanding of the fundamental verities of the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.       

 In 1956 Allan made his first pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The joy of pilgrimage under the guidance of Shoghi Effendi became the fulcrum against which he applied the lever of his convictions. He not only experienced the exaltation of this visit but, to his embarrassment, illness required him to extend his stay, as is noted in Messages to Canada, as a guest of the World Centre. The beloved Guardian took full advantage of the visit to enquire about the progress of the Cause in Canada (and in particular to clarify the status of the purchase of the Haziratu'1-Quds), and then used Allan's ongoing trip to South Africa to assure a direct communication with the beleaguered friends in Egypt via this trusted courier. 

 The sudden passing of the Guardian in 1957 was deeply felt by all who remember it. No sooner had Allan learned the news than he left on the next airplane for London. 

 His grief was, however, a mixture of personal loss and an apprehension of danger for the Baha'i community, a feat that attempts would be made to violate the Covenant of Baha'u'llah. He intensified his own deepening in the Covenant — which was to be the central theme of his teaching for the rest of his life — and then launched upon his mission. 

 He travelled across Canada sharing with the friends his experiences at the table of Shoghi Effendi, his study of Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah and his methodical but vibrantly enthusiastic conviction of the inviolability of the Covenant of Baha'u'llah. 

 He wrote a brochure on the Covenant in which he collected  and documented the Writings on this subject. 

 He committed himself totally to ihis work until the Canadian Baha'i community had formed itself into a shield of the Covenant. 

 When the assaults came from those misguided souls who had been deceived by their own vanity, Canadian Baha'is were not swayed. 

 They knew the reality of their Covenant  with 

Baha'u'llah. Allan's       

 service was recognized in 1978 — 1979 in his appointment as an assistant to Auxiliary Board member for protection, 

Carol Bowie.               

 When no longer serving on the National Spiritual Assembly, Allan handled several special assignments. 

 In 1962 he organized the travel of Canadian Baha'is to the 1963 World


<p698>
698                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Congre~s in London, and in 1968, to Sicily and Israel for the commemoration of the centenary  of the arrival of Baha'u'llah in the Holy Land. In 1971 he coordinated the North Atlantic Oceanic Conference in Iceland. But throughout this period he was most active on the various committees dealing with the legal affairs of the 

Faith in Canada. Their     

 overall mandate was to 'assure the recognition of the independent nature of the Faith in the eyes of government'. Allan patiently negotiated recognition of Baha marriage with the governments of many Canadian provinces, securing amendments to provincial legislation in Alberta and Nova Scotia. 

 He deepened the knowledge of Baha'is across Canada on the unique corporate status of Local Spiritual 

Assemblies. In 1971 the National

 Spiritual Assembly created the Office of Legal Affairs to enable Allan to perform these several duties as an executive agent to the 

National Assembly.         

 Allan's active professional work had ended in 1968. 

 A semi-retirement was warranted by the early onset of arteriosclerosis and an aneurysm. Time was limited. Indeed, one doctor whom Allan knew well confided to him that he would probably live for ten more years. 

 Thoroughly professional in planning his life, Allan knew he had work yet to do and he did it. In 1970 he organized a pilgrimage to Israel and IrAn for fifteen Canadian Baha'is including his whole family. He again made pilgrimage to Haifa in 1973 and in 1977. During this last visit Allan sought the spiritual guidance and strength to face his ultimate test. From his e*tensive experience with doctors in life insurance he knew that his time had come. In September 1977 his bladder was removed. 

 The Baha'i friends offered Allan their prayers. While he welcomed these prayers he repeatedly asked that they be not for his health but for his steadfastness. 

 His fear of God was real and tangible. During the last months of his life he continued to teach and deepen the friends. 

 In December 1978 he discovered that the ulcer in his bladder had been a tumour and had spread. His lungs were affected. On 21 March 1979 he was given six months to live. 

 He was determined to remain active. The 'Coping with Cancer' agency were so impressed  by his positive attitude that he was among five patients who were interviewed extensively for a film on cancer treatment. Throughout the last summer of his life Allan was in and out of hospital for chemotherapy. But he continued to travel and to conduct deepening classes on the Covenant. 

 In his hospital room he kept teaching. Between visitors he telephoned his farewell message to other friends. 

 To his last day he repeated his request for prayers for his steadfastness. When the time came, Allan was able to show all those who had prayed for him the power of their prayers. 

 He reached out for his tattered copy of Gleanings and clutched it to his heart. 

 With that, in the early hours of 25 September 1979, Allan Raynor ascended to meet his Lord. 

 So moving and eloquent was he at the hour of his death that Canada's national newspaper printed a major article on his life. Roger White published in The Witness of Pebbles his poem written in tribute to Allan — 'Jn Recognition'  — which was inspired during Allan's 1977 pilgrimage. And in his

IN MEMORIAM                699

      Baha Vujddni            

  Mr. Baha VujdAni, a devoted Baha'i of Miy6ndu6b, pioneered to MahAbAd, in West Adhirb4yj6n Province, northwestern Iran, in 1954 and established himself as a merchant. His scrupulous honesty and personal integrity won him great respect in the business community and he was well tnown and much liked by the citizens of his adopted city because  of his sincerity and friendliness. 

 Mr. VujdAni found much happiness in serving the Baha'i Faith and often was elected a delegate from his region to the 

Annual Convention.      

 In his fifty-seventh year, with all the good that the life of this world offers within his grasp, he was torn from the bosom of his family to join the ranks of those who have been martyred for the Cause of Baha'u'llah in His native land. On 26 September 1979, Mr. Vujd~nf was called before the Revolutionary Court and falsely accused of participating in a political disturbance. 

 During the course of the interrogation he explained that as a Baha he was forbidden to engage in political or subversive activities. At the mention of the Faith of Baha'u'llah the presiding Judge, Shaykh Khal-kh6lf,  abandoned the line of questioning relevant to the purpose for which Mr. Vujd6ni was summoned before the Court and pressed him to recant his faith. He was offered his freedom on condition that he repudiate the Baha'i Faith and embrace IsI6m. 

 When refusal  was forthcoming, the Judge offered as an alternative the paying of a substantial sum of money. Mr. Vujddni explained that as a Baha he found it necessary, as a matter of principle, to reject the idea of paying what would amount to a ransom. A disturbance outside the courtroom at this point engaged the attention of the Judge and other Court officials, and the prisoner was released. 

 He was permitted to return to his home and was t~. told that, if necessary, he would be summoned to reappear before the Court the following day. 

 It was 7:00 pm. and he had been called for interrogation in the morning hours. 

 The following day Mr. VujdAnf was called back before the Revolutionary Court at 10:00 a.m., and at 11:30 a.m. was condemned to death and placed in prison where, after several hours, confirmation of the decree was read to him. 

 According to some fellow prisoners who were later freed, Mr. Vujd~ni received the news calmly and, with the greatest courtesy, invited the other prisoners to share the bread, cheese and melons he had brought from home, spreading these before them with a happy smile as if inviting them to a feast. 'We were struck with wonder,' one prisoner said. 'How could he have been so radiantly happy on the eve of his execution!' 

 Mr. Vujd6ni wasable to obtain a fragment of lightly-waxed corrugated paper that had lined a biscuit tin and, in a firm hand, he wrote on it a final message to his family. This document, which has been preserved, reads: 'To the family of Vujd~ni: Mans6rih Kh& num, Nayyirih, Munirih, HumAy6n, Bizhan, Mr. Ma'navi, Engr. and Mr. Jlasan-'Ali Khdn, Engr. 

 'I have been condemned to death because I have refused to recant my faith and my submission to the Baha religion. 

 I do not know when the time of execution will aPse. However, I bid farewell to all.' 

 This done, he turned with dignity to the

 At 3:30 p.m. on 27 September 1979, Mr. Vujd4ni and three other prisoners who were not Baha'is were taken from the prison to an adjacent courtyard where repeated shots were heard to ring out. 

 The bodies of the executed men were unceremoniously left in the yard of the nearby clinic and their families were instructed to remove them for burial. 

 A notice was posted next to the clinic on which there appeared the names of the dead prisoners and the charges on which they had been tried. 'Baha'i religion' was written beside Mr. Vuj-dhni's name in the place where the charge was set out. 

 Later it was noticed that someone had drawn a line through the words 'Baha'i religion'. 

 Thus it was that Baha VujdAni was called upon to tread the path of martyrdom as had thousands of his fellow Baha'is before him in the Land of Baha'u'llah's birth.

  As a small boy Franz Pdllinger was taken from Kiagenfurt, Austria, where he was born in 1895, to live with his grandparents in the

IN MEMORIAM               701

     Franz P6llinger            
                           
Turrach mountains. He      

 had lost his father very early in life, and his mother was forced to work in the city to support the family. It soon became apparent that Franz could not see well. During the seven years he was able to attend school, he had great difficulty with subjects requiring use of his eyes. Later, because of poor eyesight, he was unable to retain any of the many jobs he attempted —  working in a foundry, as a construction worker or as the pit boy in a mine. Pie also worked for a time as a painter, as a fire boy in a coffee house, and in a theatre, until he finally found a position in the household of a nobleman in lower Austria. In his search for an ophthalmologist who could correct his failing eyesight, Franz went to Munich in 1914. The doctors in Germany were no more successful in curing his condition than those in Austria had been. He therefore made himself a monocle from a flashlight lens and was thus able to read a little with one eye. 

 While working in the household of the Bavarian envoy in Stuttgart, Mr. P6llinger met Mr. Bauer, the household masseur, who befriended him. During a Sunday afternoon visit to the Bauer family, Franz mentioned that truth was more important to him than anything else. 

 Mrs. Bauer told him that as a seeker of truth he should know that Christ had returned and had suffered imprisonment and exile for forty years. He was intrigued and asked to hear more. That Sunday was 23 May 1916, the anniversary of the Declaration of the BTh. As Mr. Pdllinger himself later related, 'At home I of course read the booklet, and those Words of Baha'u'llah, the Words of Wisdom, impressed me greatly. "My God," I thought, "how wide I can open my lungs to the air, as if my lungs were filled with ethereal air!" That was what I felt; I was electrified by the beauty of those Words. Thus I received the Baha'i teachings — that was my commencement.' 

 Franz used the remaining time before returning to Vienna to study the 

Baha'i Writings             

 — in spite of his disability — and to visit deepening  classes and firesides. He received answers  to his many questions from Miss Alma Knobloch' who was his true spiritual teacher. Lie wrote to 'Abdu'l-Baha and in return received a short Tablet in which the Master assured him of His prayers that he be able to successfully overcome self, acquire divine perception and be vivified by the eternal Glad Tidings. When he left Stuttgart to return to Vienna, his only solace was that in Vienna he was closer to the Holy Land and thus to 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Neither the fact that he was completely alone nor the severity of the period following World War I lessened his courage or diminished his love for the Cause. 

 In a Tablet to Alma Knobloch, who had written of Franz Pdllinger's deteriorating eyesight  and of his search for an ophthalmologist, 'Abdu'l-Baha responded that He prayed Mr. Pdllinger's eyes would be so enlightened that he would become a discoverer of reality in all stages of life. Franz recounted, 'I then realized that my earthly eyes were not of the same importance as the eternal eyes, the eyes of the soul, and that 'Abdu'l-Baha had opened my eyes through His believers, through Ills friends. It was a great exultation!' 

 In the period that followed, during which

702                THE flA}iA'i WORLD Franz found the first waiting souls in Vienna and in St. Veit an der Glan, he received his second Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha: '0 thou who art thirsty for the water of Heavenly Life! Thy letter has been received. Its contents imparted great joy because they were expressive of firmness and steadfastness. 

 'I feel great kindness toward thee and supplicate eternal endearment and everlasting life for thee so that thou mayest in those regions raise the ca~1 of the Kingdom, delivering  the people from the obscurities of the world of nature through the hght of guidance, that thou mayest, like the Egyptian messenger,  become the bearer of the garment of the heavenly Joseph, giving light to the eyes of the Jacobs and perfuming nostrils with the fragrances of the mantle of the Joseph of the Kingdom. 

 'Give the divine Glad Tidings to the friends in Vienna, so that they may attain to eternal blessings, obtain new life and acquire limitless rapture and joy.' 

 'These regions are greatly in need of the heavenly Glad Tidings because all have through the severity of the calamities of the war, become disappointed, withered, faded and almost dead. So they are in need of the breath of life. This breath of hfe is simply the heavenly 

Glad Tidings. Nothing     

 can relieve  them from this sorrow, grief, depression, disappointment except the divine Glad Tidings. 

 Because of his servitude and his love for Baha'i 

11Th, Franz P6llinger     

 was the magnet that drew a number of thirsting souls to the Ocean of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. These souls formed the basis of the Viennese Baha'i community. Later, at an institute for the blind where he learned basket weaving, he found a number of souls whose spiritual eyes were open and who recognized the truth of Baha'u'llah's message. 

     The first Local Spiritual 

 Assembly of Vienna was formed in 1926. In the meantime, through Franz's indefatigable efforts, a fledgling  Baha'i community was established in Graz. 
During this period, Martha

Root and Marzieh Carpenter 
(now Gail) arrived in Vienna.

 Franz was always ready to assist Cited, in this translation, in Star of the West, vol. 13, no. 10, January 1923, p. 281, where the name of the recipient is erroneously given as 

Pallinger.                

 where he could: he organized public Lectures, firesides and deepening classes, and found ways to introduce Martha Root to Austria's leading public figures. Although there was widespread unemployment in Vienna, he did not hesitate to leave his job whenever he felt called upon to serve. 

 After Shoghi Effendi assumed his office as Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, he addressed Mr. Pdllinger in many letters as 'My dearest Franz', 'My dear coworker', or 'My dear and precious coworker'.. 

 A postscript penned in his own hand to a letter written on his behalf on 7 September 1926 states, 

'My dearest Franz: Your   

 most welcome letter has profoundly  touched me. 

 Continue in your steadfast heroic efforts and never forget that your exemplary services are engraved in characters of gold upon the radiant scroll in the AbM Kingdom. You occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart. Your unsparing efforts are drawing you closer and closer to the heart of the CAuse. 

 You are destined to render memorable services to our beloved Cause. If you but persevere, doors will be opened to your face, obstacles will be fast removed and you will witness the harvest for which you are preparing so devotedly. 

 Write me in full and frequently for I thirst for the glad-tidings of your letters. 

 I will continue to pray for you from all my heart.' 

 The Guardian's love and encouragement stimulated him to sacrifice even more of himself for the 

Cause of God.             
        Franz Pdllinger married   

Anna Mddlagl on 8 July    

 1935. From that time they trod the path of service and sacrifice together, with faces shining and their beings full of humour. However, the times were deteriorating noticeably  as society lost its equilibrium and order vanished. Soon all meetings had to be registered  with the police who sent a plainclothes policeman to note all occurrences. 

 The right of assembly was suspended entirely in 1937, which precluded further Baha meetings. 

 This was the beginning of a very sad time for the Austrian Baha community. 

 As most of the Baha in Austria were of Jewish ancestry, those who did not leave the country were deported to concentration camps. Mr. and Mrs. Pdllinger attempted to help wherever possible, at no little danger to themselves. At the end of World War II only a small number of Baha'is remained in Austria.

  daunted courage they began to rebuild the community. 

 Franz even attempted to have the Baha'i Faith officiaBy recognized by the occupying powers. 

 Before the Guardian died he had stipulated. that the National Spiritual Assembly of Austria  should be formed in 1959. The necessary foundations were laid through the formation of the Local 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 of Graz Salzburg, Innsbruck and Linz whose establishment was aided through the efforts of pioneers  from I ran, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United 

States of America. When    

 the first National Spiritual Assembly was elected at Ridvan 1959, Franz Pdllinger was one of the nine members. 

 In 1963, after forty-seVen years, Franz's dearest wish was fulfilled. Alma Knobloch had taught him a prayer which expressed the desire to make a pilgrimage to 'Akka and Haifa. When the first Universal House of Justice was elected, Franz Pdllinger was present. 

 His dream was fulfilled, his patience rewarded. 

 In the following years there were very few activities in which he did not take part, whether summer or winter schools, seminars or firesides, youth camps or teaching activities. His humorous contributions, filled with the varied experience of his life, enriched every meeting. 

 At the close of the Five Year Plan (1973 — 1978), as the Austrian Baha'i community  reached a new level of development, he was able to witness the fruits of his lengthy and untiring effort in the service of the Cause of 

Baha'u'llah.               

 In the final weeks of his life, Franz Pdllinger felt as if he were being called home. At last he could hasten to meet 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, whose mandate to spread the divine Glad Tidings in Austria he had never neglected. After sixty-three years of loyal service, his shining soul winged its way back to its Creator. Our prayers accompany it.

  Knight of Baha'u'llah      

 a Knight of Baha'u'llah for having pioneered to the Island of Mauritius in 1953,1 passed on to the Abh6 Kingdom on 29 October 1979 in San Mateo, California. She was laid to rest in the beautiful hills overlooking an expanse of the great Pacific 

Ocean.                     

 Oceans were not a barrier to Ottilie's adventuresome spirit. She was to cross and recross the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Indian Oceans by both sea and air. 

 She set goals for herself and went about accomplishing them regardless of the perils she might face. 

 As a young girl she left her native Germany to seek adventure in the United States where she settled in Chicago and managed a building in which she rented rooms. One of her tenants, Betty Powers, had in her room a photograph of 'Abdu'l-Baha which aroused Ottilie's pass-lug  interest — she thought Him a Holy Man —  but through changing her job Ottilie lost contact with the Baha until 1941 when the distress and loneliness occasioned by World War II caused her to be drawn irresistibly to the Baha'i Temple. 

 After attending meetings conducted by Melvin Newport and 

Albert Windust, Ottilie    

 gave her heart and life to Baha'u'llah. 'The Guardian will pray that, in the days to come, you may render the Faith many lasting and noteworthy services,' Shoghi Effendi's secretary wrote to her on his behalf on 10 December 

1942. Almost immediately Ottilie

 arose to pioneer in Arizona to fill a goal of the Seven Year Plan in that State. From here she moved to San Mateo, California, where her dear Baha'i friend, Mrs. Lisette Berger, made her welcome. San Mateo became the base to which she would return from her various international pioneering posts when necessity dictated. As a naturalized citizen of the United States she could not be away from the country for more than five years without losing her citizenship. 

 Ottilie was present at the International Conference in Chicago in 1953 when the beloved Guardian launched the Ten Year Crusade. 

 All hearts were touched and a flood of volunteers arose in response to the call for pioneers. 

 But Ottilie was always a person of action and she was one of the first to put her affairs in order and leave. She stored some of herbelongings with Mrs. Berger and departed Ottilie Rhein, named by the beloved Guardian Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World, p. 57.

      Ottilie Rhein              

  with only minimal luggage. 
She had thought of joining 

Rex and Mary Collison      

 in Uganda but the Guardian had specified the settlement of virgin areas so she determined to go to Mauritius, an island mentioned by name in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets of the Divine Plan and one 'whose name was enshrined in Baha history 'during the Heroic Age as the source, two years before 'Abdu'l-Baha's arrival in America, of a contribution towards the purchase of the site of the Mother Temple of the West'.1 

 She pored over maps, atlases and encyclopedias but could discover very little about the island except that it had a mixed population, that sugar cane was the chief crop raised and that French and English were spoken. But that was enough for her, and excitedly she boarded a ship at Mombasa  after having visited Kenya, Uganda and Tangaiiyika (now Tanzania). 

 She arrived in a heavy downpour on 11 November 

1953. Shoghi Effendi's     

 cable — ASSURE RHEIN LOVING APPRECIATION — Was relayed to her on 4 December by Paul E. Haney, then chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States. 
                           
1 The Universal House      

 of Justice, The Baha'i World, vol. XV, p. 299. 

 Ottilie's utter trust in Baha'u'llah enabled her to overcome the difficulties she encountered.  She rejoiced at obtaining a visa which was valid for six months and which later was extended to three years plus three months. 

 With the assistance of a German missionary she found a house which-offered offered the barest necessities but which provided a setting for Baha'i meetings. 

 Her first shopping expedition, occasioned by the urgent need to acquire mosquito netting, led her to a shop whose proprietor, Mr. Him Lim, a Chinese, became the first resident of Mauritius to accept the Faith. When she had enrolled two Baha'is and had interested a number of inquirers, Mr. Jalhl Nakhjav6ni,2 and later another Persian believer, visited the island and assisted with the teaching work. By 1956, just before her visa expired, there were forty Baha'is, enough to form three Local Spiritual Assemblies. 

 Although some vacillated at the last moment, Ottilie was determined not to be deprived of victory. 

 By sheer determination she confirmed some new believers and induced  others to change residence with the result that there were established — as she later recorded — 'three Local 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 for the three years of teaching'. A strong and self reliant foundation had been laid. This victory made it possible for Mauritius to send a delegate to the historic first Regional Convention  convened at the farm of Mr. and Mrs. William Sears, near Johannesburg, South Africa, at Ridvan 1956. ButOttilie's service in Mauritius was at an end. Her request for an extension of her visa was refused although she called upon the Governor who listened sympathetically to her appeal and was attentive to her explanation of the Faith. This same gentleman — Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam —  later became Prime Minister and addressed the Baha Oceanic Conference held in Mauritius  in August 1970. Ottilie had the bounty of attending that gathering and of rebeiving his smile of recognition. 

     After leaving Mauritius    

 she remained in Kampala for a time lending much needed assistance in the production of Baha'i literature  until it became necessary for her to return to the United States to safeguard her citizenship. 

 But her restless spirit could not be idle 2 See 'In Memoriam', p. 797.


<p705>
IN MEMORIAM                705

  when the Faith needed pioneers. By 1959 she had saved enough money to make a pilgrimage  to the Holy Land and then settle in Chile where, by living frugally, she was able to remain from 1960 until 1963. Chile was her last international venture, but in her home community of San Mateo she could always be depended upon to contribute her share to every activity. One of her greatest joys was to keep in touch with her Baha'i friends throughout the world. 

 On 27 December 1978 the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of Mauritius wrote to Ottilie Rhein, addressing her as 'Spiritual Mother of Mauritius', and conveying 'deep Jove and gratitude on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Faith in Mauritius It is highly significant that God's Message for this day was planted in this island by a lady. 

 We turn our hearts in thankfulness to Baha'u'llah that you were chosen for this and we pray to Him that He may shower all His blessings on you and bring you eternal joy and happiness. Present generations may not be aware of the import of such a feat by you, but your name will forever be associated with the Faith in Mauritius and future genenitions will befittingly mark the event of your first coming to Mauritius. 

 It may not be without meaning that when you landed in Mauritius on that morning of Sunday, the 11th November 1953, it was raining heavily —  the happy presage of a bountiful harvest. 

 And again, on 21 February 1979, 'We were deeply touched to read the copy of the letter the Universal House of Justice addressed to you on the 29th November 1978 and appreciate your kind thoughts for Mauritius. It is incredible that a quarter of a century has elapsed since you arrived in Mauritius. 

 The seed you planted has grown and it has no doubt been sustained by your love, devotion and sincerity in the Cause of God We have now seventy-four Local 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 Ottilie remained in spirit a true pioneer right to the end. In her life she manifested the seven qualifications of the divinely enlightened soul mentioned by 'Abdu'l-Baha in one of His Tablets: knowledge of God, faith, steadfastness, truthfulness, uprightness, fidelity and evanescence or humility. 

 She was honoured at the time of her passing with the following cable from the Universal House of

  One must see the example of sincere love, patience, discipline and humility in order to believe in the existence of these qualities. Mabel Adelle Sneider possessed them all, and more. She was born in Casper, Wyoming, U.S.A. on 8 September 1901 and grew up on a cattle ranch in Thermopolis, Wyoming, acquiring a deep love for horses and the outdoors. After graduating from high school she attended Fort 

Collins Agricultural       

 College and then studied nursing which was her lifelong profession. Mabel declared her faith in Baha'u'llah in 1946 in Panama where she worked at the Gorgas Hospital. When asked why she became a Baha'i, she simply stated, 'It made sense.' From the moment she embraced  the Cause of Baha'u'llah she devoted her time and effort to furthering its progress. Putting her pioneering spirit into action, she made long-range plans to pioneer for the Faith after she retired from nursing. 

 Mabel was adventurous but practical in nature, and she loved to travel.


<p706>

   Mabel Adelle Sneider      

  In 1953 Mabel had the privilege of making her pilgrimage and of meeting the beloved Guardian. 

Dorothy Baker and Millie  

 Collins were also in the Holy Land at that time. 

 The friendship that Mabel formed with these two outstanding believers exerted an influence which lasted the rest of her life. 

 One of the many services that Mabel performed for the Faith in Panama was that of assisting in the selection and purchase of the original land for the Panama House of Worship, a parcel that was later exchanged for the present Temple site. She went as a travelling teacher to Africa and to Central and South America. She retired after thirty years of service at the Gorgas Hospital and, on 17 July 1958, left Panama for the island of Tarawa, Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), in the South Pacific, where she remained for fifteen years. Knowing what to expect when she reached her destination, she purchased a hand-operated machine for making cement blocks, a set of directions for making a native-style stove, and a bicycle which was her sole means of transportation.  With the blocks she built herself a house based somewhat on an African model, and constructed a stove. Her residence on the island of Bikenibeu became widely known as 'Mabel's house'. Although there were discouraging moments, she wrote in March 1964, 'There have been rare cases when, having talked with someone of the Faith, you felt that great spirit, and then the feeling of having to come back into this world and walk on the roads again. You live in hopes of capturing  these moments again How blessed, though, I am, for I do have the love and loyalty of many and they really love the Faith. Their lives have been completely changed and they are willing to devote their entire time to the teaching of the Faith. I am certain they are very dear to Baha'u'llah. This is one of the reasons you feel that this is your home and where you hope to stay.' 

 During her first few years in the islands Mabel spent most of her time travelling to every island to meet the Baha'is and help them establish the Faith. 

 She served on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Gilbert Islands which was formed for the first time in 1967 and held the offices of secretary or treasurer. She helped purchase the site for the 

National Hazfratu'1-Quds. 

 She was twice a delegate to the International Convention in Haifa for the election of the Universal 

House of Justice. Her     

 marriage in August 1965 to Mr. Tebakasro Aritiera ended in divorce in 1975 at which time she reverted to the use of her maiden name. 

 The need for medical attention forced Mabel to return to the United States in 1975. Even with severely impaired eyesight she vigorously served the Faith in Huntsville, Texas, whose lapsed Local Spiritual Assembly was formed again in 1978 with Mabel as chairman.  The friends in Huntsville felt blessed to have her in their midst. 

 She had an introverted personality. She was a listener and rarely spoke, but when she did she was mild, loving and honest; she had a childlike quality in her manner. 

    Mabel served Baha'u'llah's

 Cause to her utmost. Her intense love for the Faith and her determination to get things done were an inspiration to all who knew her. A few weeks before her passing, the local newspaper ran a picture of the Mother Temple of the West and featured the Baha'i Faith as the religion of the week. 

 As Mabel looked at the photograph of the House of Worship she remArked, 'I have done everything that I wanted to do for the

Faith.' On 4 December     

 1979, in her seventy-ninth year, she passed away as the result of a stroke.

    HELEN HAZEL WJLKS         

 1903 — 1980 Helen Wilks was born on 31 March 1903 in Anderson, Indiana, U.S.A. Her father died in 1919, whereupon she went to live with an aunt and uncle in Bellingham, Washington, where she completed her education and became a teacher. 

 Her first position was in a one-room schoolhouse in Glacier, Washington, near Mt. Baker. Many of her students were older than she was. She would walk to school through the snow with her legs bound in burlap bags. Before the students arrived it was her duty to start the fire in the wood-burning stove, chop enough wood for the following day, then sweep the floor. 

 During the depression, in the early 1930s, Helen worked as a clerk in a store. A coworker, Anna Reed, walked across the aisle and whispered in her ear, 'Did you know Christ has returned?' 

 Instead of dismissing this as the remark of a fanatic or crank, Helen thought: 'If He has, where is He?' Helen's daughter, Phylis Kiehn, takes up the story: 'And so the seed was planted. Mother listened, studied, and decided that this strange new religion was not for her. She packed the Ford with her belongings and set off for Phoenix, Arizona, but, as I recall, we weren't there very long before she exclaimed that she must know more about this religion. 

 She left us in Phoenix and hitchhiked all the way back to Seattle, a distance of about 1,600 miles, in order to locate and further question Anna Reed. In 1934 mother became a confirmed Baha'i and started a children's class at the Baha'i Centre in the old Arcade Building in Seattle. The class was her first — I was "the children". 

 After she remarried in 1936 the class comprised myself and my stepbrother.' 

 William S. WiIks became a dedicated Baha'i not Long after his marriage to Helen. Over the years the couple moved seven times in the Seattle area in order to help establish new Local Spiritual Assemblies. 

At the London Congress    

 in 1963 they made their plans for their greatest move — as pioneers to Africa. Would that space permitted the recounting of all their experiences in this new wnture! On their first teaching trip, much to their astonishment, they found themselves snowbound for three days in southern Africa. William — or 'Bill' as he was known — died on 14 December 1965, two days before his sixty-fifth birthday, and is buried in Mbabane, Swaziland. 

 Helen survived him by fifteen years which were devoted to ceaseless teaching trips in some nine or more countries in the southern Africa area. 

 Her passing on 3 January 1980, following  a massive heart attack, ended a life of great service on this earth. Counsellor Shidan Fat'he-Aazam, alluding to the wish of a true soldier to die with his boots on, wrote of her:


<p708>
708                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  'Well, our dear Helen, whom we alLknow was a real and true soldier in the Army of Baha'u'llah, ifiways had her boots on for fear she might have to face her Lord without them. Those of us who knew her and worked with her could bear witness to her love, her devotion and her self-sacrifice for our beloved Faith. 

 She gave herself totally, body and soul, to Baha'u'llah. 

 Every step she took, every breath she drew, was to promote the Faith of God. At the age of seventy-six her spirit and her energy were youthful — so full of happiness, life and vitality. Her contribution to our beloved Faith, both in her native land and in the continent of her adoption, Africa, was tremendous. She was an indefatigable teacher of the Faith — always on the go, constantly seeking contacts and giving the Message During the last fourteen years of her life Helen served the Faith as a member of the Auxiliary Board for Propagation, first in Swaziland and then in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe),  and was sent by the Continental Board of Counsellors for Africa on special projects in South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, 

SeychelLes and Mauritius.  

 In all these places she will be remembered with deep love, admiration, awe and gratitude. In January 1980 Gary Worth, a fellow pioneer to Zimbabwe, paid tribute: 'Her spirit and enthusiasm,  her energy, her sense of fun and laughter, and her desire to teach the multitudes  about Baha'u'llah were unmatched by any other person I have met in my lifetime despite age, failing health and poor eyesight, Helen had not decreased her activities  on behalf of the Faith in the slightest bit. She begged for and scraped up valuable petrol coupons so that she could continue her teaching work in this wartorn country. She spent most of her small pension on petrol for her car. 

 In this way she continued to bring the Baha'i teachings to the people of this region through her never-failing spirit and love of life On the very day of her heart attack, Helen made an exhausting teaching trip to at least eleven areas and on her last evening attended a meeting of a local Baha'i Women's Club. 

 On her deathbed she sent a message to her teaching companion, Mr. Carlos Kaupo, an assistant Auxiliary Board member, encouraging  him to continue teaching. lie has

 I am not qualified to speak of Helen Wilks's valiant services to the Faith, because she had reached a level of spirit and understanding  which I do not comprehend. 

 But with her passing, I am rededicating my life Helen's devoted services earned her the following cable sent by the International Teaching Centre to the Continental Board of Counsellors in

  of friends like Helen Wilks may serve to inspire other friends in their aspirations for services to the Threshold of the Blessed Beauty, and to guide them in what they can achieve by devoting their resources to the advancement of the Cause of Baha'u'llah.' 

 Helen's wish to 'die with her boots on' was granted. 

 After her passing, comfort was taken in the knowledge that she took her flight to the Abh~i Kingdom the way she always wished, dying in service to God.

ISFANDLYAR OHOBAD          
(ISFANDIYAR QUBAD)         

 1895 — 1980 Lsfandiyar Ghobad was born into a Zoroastrian family in 1895 in Yazd, IrAn. He was brought up in surroundings which were coloured by deep-rooted religious orthodoxy 

    Isfandiyar Ghobad          

 and tainted by ancestral superstitions, prejudices and rituals. As a young man his quest for religious truth was ardent. While still a school student he would frequently challenge, in the presence of the religious instructor, the validity of the concepts prevalent amongst his own people, in return for which he would be punished harshly and accused of having been influenced by the 'heresy' of the Mbi movement. 

 These confrontations made his receptive  soul even more sensitive to the light of divine guidance. 

 At last, through a new bond of marriage in the family household, be came to hear about Baha'u'llah from his brother-in-law, a staunch Baha'i. The seed of faith which had germinated in his heart soon became a fruitful tree as a result of the instruction and loving care of such prominent souls as H• 

Muhammad T6hir-i-M6imirf   
and 1-I6ji Muhammad  T6hir-i-Qandahhri.

 Isfandiyar's recognition of Baha'u'llah at the age of twenty-two enkindled the flame of faith in the hearts of his entire family. Soon after his declaration he wrote to 'Abdu'l-Baha and in reply he received an inspiring Tablet which instilled in his heart a new zeal and hope. He joined his father in trade but events forced him to leave his homeland for India and from there he proceeded to the Holy Land on pilgrimage. His arrival in the Hoiy Land coincided with the Guardian's departure from Haifa after the Ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha  As a result he attained the presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf whose loving grace and affection encompassed him for fifty days. During that period he was privileged to receive from her gracious hand a copy of the Tablet of the Holy Mariner in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, as well as a letter full of encouragement and assuring him of a subsequent visit. After a few months' sojourn in Cairo, the joyous news of the Guardian's return reached him. Lie again asked permission to come to the Holy Land and to his joy received a loving invitation in which the Guardian expressed his eagerness to welcome him. On 19 October 1924 he set off for Haifa and was honoured to bask for forty days in the sunshine of the loving  kindness of the beloved Guardian. 

 Isfan-diyar's  real spiritual life began to take shape during this memorable pilgrimage and the Guardian's parting words — 'Isfancliyar, I shall


<p710>
710                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  never forget you, be assured' — engraved themselves  indelibly on his heart and became his 'best provision' for the rest of his life. 

 On his return to I r~n he was appointed to serve on various administrative bodies of the Faith which w~re closely associated with activities of the Baha youth and teaching. In later years he was elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihr~n and he remained a member until he left I ran. 

 His third pilgrimage — this time accompanied  by his wife and youngest daughter —  took place in 1952, immediately before the launching of the Ten Year Crusade. 

 They were among the pilgrims who heard from the Guardian's own lips his glorious message about the unfoldment of divine destiny through the implementation of the Ten Year Plan; they were galvanized by the spirit of urgency of the moment. 

 A few months after Isfandiyar returned to TihrAn the National Spiritual Assembly assigned him the task of visiting the believers in the towns and cities of the southern part of I r~n to share with them the joyous news of the commencement of the Ten Year Crusade and to stimulate their participation in its prosecution. His wife, Pariz6d, accompanied him. 

 Profoundly touched by the call himself, Isfandiyar and his family pioneered to Bursa, Turkey, and later to Recife, Brazil. 

 While in Bursa, in 1962, he and his wife had had the privilege of being invited to accompany the Hand of the Cause of God TarAzu'llAh Saman-dad on his three-month tour of Pakistan, India, Ceylon and Burma, a unique opportunity which was joyfully seized and which brought many inspiring experiences. 

 In 1967 he settled in the United Kingdom where he remained in active service to the Cause until he passed on to the AbhA 

Kingdom  on 18 January    

 1980. He was buried in the precincts of the blessed resting-place of the beloved of his heart, Shoghi 

Effendi.                   

 From the time he became a Baha, Isfandi-yar  Ohobad served with all his strength, even in his later years when he suffered from a heart condition. He is remembered by those who knew him as one steadfast in the Faith, dedicated in its service, forbearing in sufferings,  radiant and assured in heart and submissive  to the will of God. Precision and order were characteristic of both his private life and his professional practice. 

 His life's achievements were crowned by the cable sent by the Universal House of Justice on 21

  DR. M. FIROOZMAND 

        MUHAMMAD 'ALt FALLAH AFNAN 

 1888 — 1980  

Mirza Muhammad 'Ali Afn~n 
was the son of Mirza      

Muhammad B6qir AfnAn.      

 His mother was the granddaughter of the younger uncle of the Bin, Mirza Husayn 'All, and his father was the grandson of the elder uncle of the BTh, Mirza 

Siyyid Muhammad.           

 He was born in Yazd, Ir6n, in the year 1888, on the very day that seven Baha of that city were martyred. 

 His father died when he was young and he was brought up by his grandfather, Mirza Muhammad Taqi Vakflu-Dawlali, the builder of the Baha'i 

Temple of 'Ishq~Md. With   

 his mother and sister he travelled from 'Ishqabad to the Holy Land to reach the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, but soon after his arrival in the Holy Land his grandfather  passed away and he was sheltered under the loving care of the Master. He was sent by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the same school in Beirut which was attended by Shoghi Effendi and later on, when the Master sent 

Shoghi Effendi to England  

 to study, He also sent the young AfnAn to study agriculture there. In some of the letters Shoghi Effendi wrote while studying in Oxford he mentions the AfiThn whom he occasionally visited in Yorkshire. 

 After completing his studies, Muhammad 'Au AfnTh returned to the Holy Land oniy twenty days before 'Abdu'l-Baha passed away. The Afnan remained in Haifa for six months and then returned to Yazd on the instructions of the beloved Guardian. 

 For many years he was elected as a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Yazd and often was privileged to serve as chairman.

  In 1939 an unfortunate incident occurred. The workman responsible for the heating of the Baha public bath was injured during the course of duty. 

 The enemies of the Faith seized the opportunity of making mischief. The chairman of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Yazd was imprisoned and other members were prosecuted. Fortunately the members were released after a short time. Eleven years later, in a village called Abarqii, soon after a Baha'i pioneer was sent from Yazd to that village, a woman and her several children were murdered in mysterious circumstances. The enemies of the Baha'i community attributed  this tragic event to the coming of the pioneer to their village. 

 As a result the nine members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Yazd were sentenced to three years' imprisonment.  They were confined to prison first in Yazd, then in Kirm6n, and finally in the prison of Tihr6n. After his release from prison the AfiPn visited the Holy Land and attained the presence of the beloved Guardian who praised the steadfastness of those who had suffered unjust imprisonment. Through their incarceration, he said, these beliovers had followed in the footsteps of the

  Inparaju was his actual name but early in life he became known as 'Inbum', meaning 'joy', 'sweet' or 'lovdy' in the Tamil language. 

  Born on 9 March 1932 in Malacca, Malaysia, he was the second child of a schoolteacher, Mr. J. V. Chinniali, who, like his wife Elizabeth Thyria Ratnam, was of 

Ceylonese origin. The      

 family had a strong affiliation with the Methodist Church in Malacca. 

 We know little of Inbum's childhood except that he was a brilliant student and an active sportsman. 

 He was a keen scout and rose to the rank of King's 

Scout, representing Malaysia 

 at a Jamboree in Australia in 1949. Although  he did very well in his Cambridge examination that same year, family circum


<p712>
712                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  stances prevented his pursuing his studies further. 

 He started off his working life as a teacher in 

Malacca High School       

 where his father had served earlier. In time Inbum rose to the post of headmaster of the 

Masjid Tanah Primary      

 School. When this appointment was made in 1957, he was the youngest person ever to have been made headmaster in the State. At a later time he was appointed headmaster of a Secondary Continuation School in Jasin and, in 1965, headmaster of Sekola 

Menangab Jasin.           

 By 1954 Malacca had become a hub of Baha'i activity. 

 Among the many active workers there were schoolteachers, one of whom was teaching in Malacca High School. Inbum attended his first Baha'i fireside — a talk on 'The New World Order' — and often mentioned that if it were not for Mr. Kumara Das he might not have accepted the Faith. 

 Inbum's marriage in 1960 to the exuberant and radiant Chinese Baha'i, Lily Leong, a fellow teacher at Masjid Tanali Primary School, drew considerable attention in Malacca where interracial marriages were still taboo. Four lovely children were born to them. 

 Early in his life, despite his quiet nature, Inbum's qualities of leadership emerged and it 

    Inpart4u Chinniah         

 is not surprising that these characteristics were identified and made use of in his service to the Baha'i Faith. 
He served on the National Teaching

Committee in Peninsular   

 Malaysia in 1962 and 1963. At the second 

National Convention      

 of Malaysia in 1965 he was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly, serving as treasurer and later as secretary. 
He settled in Kuala Lumpur.

 His home at Setapak became, as it were, a mini-hostel, harbouring numerous  students and Baha youth. One youth who stayed with him remarked, 'Inbum had the unique ability to tap the latent potential in each individual . many were the leaders who were nurtured and trained under his able hands.' 

 During his years as secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly important organizational improvements were effected in the office of that body. 

   In June 1972 the Hand     
of the Cause of God Rahmatu'116h

MulThjir visited Malaysia 

 and while there encouraged Inbum to go to Africa as a travelling teacher. 

 Inbum spent six months in Tanzania on leave without salary and made a valuable contribution to the work of the Faith there. A Malaysian travelling teacher who was in Tanzania in 1977 when Inbum was appointed to the Board of Counsellors  for Southeast Asia witnessed the great joy experienced by the African friends when they learned of his appointment. 

 He had served ably as a member of the Auxiliary Board for protection since 1972 and now he threw himself wholeheartedly into his role as Counsellor, on one occasion travelling the distance of a thousand miles by bus in order to attend a meeting in Bangkok. He was a living example of forgiveness, patience and consideration;  he saw the good in every individual and never spoke ill of anyone. 

 He had a genuine humility and the gift of ettending a tender and personal attention to those who needed his assistance. His ready wit lightened all hearts. 

 A sense of urgency was noted in the last few months of his life. He often mentioned that he looked forward to early retirement in order to devote even more time to the Faith. 

 In December 1979 when news was received of the untimely death of the Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'114h 

Muh6jir, although Inbum   

 could be seen consoling the Baha all across the country, it was obvious that no one was more

  heartbroken than himself; it was as though a lieutenant had lost his most admired general. Thirtyfive days later the lieutenant was to joifi his loved commander in the Abh6 

Kingdom.                  

 Inbum often jokingly remarked to his wife, 'I may be poor in wealth, but I am rich in friends!' The large gathering of mourners who came from all parts of the country to attend his funeral, and the torrent of telegrams and telephone calls that were received from all parts of the world, testify to what a rare friend he was. His INSPIRED

TO SOUTHEAST ASIA, the     

International  Teaching   

 Centre cabled at the time of his passing. Later, on 14 February, that institution wrote to members of the Continental  Boards of Counsellors throughout the world: 'The loss of this devoted servant of the Faith is indeed great because of his knowledge,  wide experience, high efficiency and constancy, all sweetened by an unassuming and natural humility.'

  When we returned to Canada in 1968, after fourteen years of pioneering in South Africa, we felt we had not done much for the Faith in those long years. In fact, we believed that any I

  blown over by the sand of time and be forgotten. 

 After Rosemary winged away on 20 February 1980 in Guadalajara, Mexico, due to cerebral thrombosis, I was flooded with messages from our former pioneer post. 
                           
  The Evening Post of Port   

 Elizabeth, South Africa, under the headline 'Service for Former  PB. School Library Pioneer', published the following item, together with a picture of Rosemary, in its issue of 18 March 1980: 'A memorial service for a former Port Elizabeth woman, Mrs. Rosemary Sala, who pioneered school libraries in black schools, was held in New Brighton at the weekend. The service was held at the Cowan High School, New Brighton. 

 'Mr. Frank Tonjeni, principal of Cowan High School, said Mrs. Sala was interested in black education while she lived in South Afric6. 

 "She was a very energetic woman and established libraries in all our secondary and high schools." 

 'Mrs. Sala also established a Sala Prize at three of the schools for leadership and scholastic achievement. 

 "Above the door of our school library there is a plaque bearing imprint we might have made would soon be her name," Mr. Tonjeni said.


<p714>
714                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  'Her permit to enter New Brighton was withdrawn in May, 1967.' 

 Because of the Apartheid laws, social contact in South Africa was very difficult. Rosemary succeeded in obtaining from the authorities permission to enter black townships,  where she established libraries in eleven schools, placed over 10,000 books, and brought enjoyment to thousands of students. She did this for ten years, her permit being renewed from year to year. Later it was restricted, and finally it was withdrawn. 

 Baha'i News, South and West Africa, states in its February 1980 issue: 'She is known in all the schools of New Brighton, Kwa Zakele and Zwide, and will live in our midst for ages as the mother of the Baha'is of New Brighton. Many times have I heard her say: "I have said the Greatest Name all over New Brighton and Kwa Zakele." 

 I will always remember her as the kindly lady who was never frightened — even of waiting for the local bus to take her into town. She was unceasing in her efforts to attract all levels of society to the Faith I, for one, will never rest until I have done all the things she herself would have done for the Baha'is of the townships in Port 

Elizabeth.'                

 There were many more similar eulogies. 

 Rosemary was born Mary Scott Gillies in Glasgow, 

Scotland, on 4 May 1902    

 to Captain and Mrs. Malcolm N. Gillies. When she was four her family brought her to Montreal, Quebec, where she was raised in a strict Presbyterian home. She wanted to become an architect, but the only faculty that would then accept women students was in New York City, and her mother would not allow her to move. She, therefore, had to be satisfied with graduating from Macdonald Teachers' College, near Montreal. 

 In December 1927, in Montreal, three young Baha'is — Rowland Estall, George F. Spendlove1 and myself — started the first organized Baha youth group of North America. 

 Within months a few young people were attracted, among whom was a teacher who taught in the same school as Rosemary. She invited Rosemary who came out of curiosity. The following summer Rosemary was invited to the Baha'i school in Green Acre where she was deeply influenced by the re1  See 'In Memoriam', The Baha'i World, vol. XIII, p. 895. 

 nowned teacher, Mrs. Elizabeth Greenleaf.2 That autumn Rosemary declared her faith in Baha'u'llah. Since we had three 'Mary's' in our youth group, George 

Spendlove gave Mary Gillies

 the name Rosemary which remained with her all her life. 

 She was soon elected youth delegate to the National Convention in Wilmette and was active in various national activities with the result that long after our marriage which took place in 1934 I was known only as 'the husband of Rosemary Gullies'. 

 During the past forty years we have attended many conventions, conferences, summer and winter schook, and on almost every occasion — even as recently as a year ago — I have seen young Baha with eager eyes, who have read her artide 'Marriage in the Baha'i Faith',3 corner her and become absorbed in deep discussion. Rbsemary often said that because of that article she seems to have been used, all these years, as an unofficial Baha'i marriage counsellor. 

 Rosemary and I worked together as one breath and I beg forgiveness if, in attempting to describe her services, I enumerate my own. In August 1938, while in Green Acre, we tried to induce a couple to pioneer in Latin America under the first Seven Year Plan. By the time we reached our home in St. Lambert, Quebec, we realized that while trying to inspire others we had talked ourselves into going. 

 After six months of intensive preparation  and an immersion course in Spanish, we set sail the following spring for Caracas, Venezuela, where we stayed for a year.4 We found the experience so joyful and thri11in~ that the desire to pioneer remained with us for the rest of our lives. On our return journey to Canada we drove sixteen hours a day for eight days on a primitive, tortuous mountain road from Caracas to BogotA, Colombia. 

 Since we were the first Baha to make that trip, Rosemary invoked the Greatest Name in every valley and hamlet. We returned to Caracas in 1946 during the course of a four-month  lecture tour which took us to every country in Latin 

America except Paraguay. One

 of the highlights for us was our visit, in Buenos Aires, to the resting-place of Mrs.

  May Maxwell where we offered prayers. In 1947 we were back in Venezuela, this time during the course of a Caribbean teaching tour. 

 In Canada we were instrumental in the creation of the first summer conferences and the Laurentian Baha'i School; and, as members of the Canadian National Teaching Corn. mittee, we helped to prepare the Canadian community for the election, in 1948, of its first National Spiritual Assembly on which we served for the following six years.1 

 In 1952 Rosemary went on her first pilgrimage to Haifa as a guest of the Guardian. Her second visit to the Holy Land was in 1968 as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of South and 

West Africa.               

 With the announcement of the Ten Year Crusade we volunteered to pioneer. 

 The Guardian suggested Comoro Islands in the Indian Ocean, but since a visa was refused he gave us Zululand as a second choice. We arrived in May 1954 and settled on a trading post in a native reserve, with no telephone or electricity. 

 We were two hours' distance from the nearest doctor or police station. To our great disappointment, after one year our permit was not renewed. We moved to Port Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, where we lived for thirteen years. We had to return to Canada for three years —  which was a culture shock in reverse — and were happy to pioneer again, in 1971, this time to Guadalajara, Mexico. Previous to this, however, we made a tour of the Far East. We travelled all over Mexico, attended the Merida Conference and made two side trips to Panama. Rosemary spent many weeks preparing illustrated albums about historical events related to the Faith which are on display at the Baha'i Shrine in 

Montreal.                  
   Abdu'l-Baha R6hfyyih      

 KMnum wrote this about Rosemary: 'She was a remarkable woman, a very sweet one, and her devotion to the Faith was truly exemplary. 

 It never flagged but went on year after year to the very last breath. 

 May we all die as she did, with the good pleasure of Baha'u'llah. She was also a devoted friend and a loyal one, and I shall miss very much receiving her letters Rosemary will certainly go down as one of 

Canada's outstanding Baha'is

 as the Canadian community emerged and grew in stature and strength.' 

 The Hand of the Cause John Robarts and his wife, Audrey, lifelong friends, chose for Rosemary the following from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha: 0 ye handmaid of the merciful Lord! 

 How many queens' of this world laid down their heads on a pillow of dust and disappeared. 

 No fruit was left of them, no trace, no sign, not even their names Not so the handmaids who ministered at the Threshold of God; these have shone forth like glittering stars in the skies of ancient glory, shedding their splendours across all the reaches of time.2

      ROBERT HAYDEN              

 1913 — 1980 Robert Earl Hayden was born in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., on 4 August 1913 of poor, uneducated parents. 
At birth he was named Asa  

Bundy Sheffey, 'Asa'       

 being his father's name and 'Bundy' the name of the family doctor who had attended his birth. 

 After the separation and divorce of his parents while he was still an infant, his mother put him in the care of friends, 

William and Sue Ellen      

 Hayden, while she set about finding work to provide for him. A job was found in Buffalo, New York, and she moved there, visiting Robert and the Haydens occasionally. 

 The Haydens did not like the name 'Asa' for the boy and, hoping that they would be permitted to adopt him as their own, renamed him 'Robert Earl'. 

 His mother did not object to this, esp~cia11y since she felt that the child had a good home while she was working. 

 It was during his preschool years that it was discovered how little sight he had. 

 Nevertheless,  he was provided with glasses and eagerly learned to read before entering school. During his elementary school years he read a dictionary,  an encyclopedia and any other available material, although he was placed in the sight-saving  class.

  was registered as Robert Earl Hayden. Not until his fortieth year did he come to know that this was not his legal name. 

 Only in 1978 was it made legal. 

 All his basic education was received in Detroit. 

 Since there was no money for college when he finished high school, he gave up hope of acquiring a higher education. However, the social worker who served his family interceded because of the obvious capabilities of the young mAn and enabled him to receive a four-year scholarship to Detroit City College, now known as Wayne State University. 

 In the summer of 1938, four years after completing his college work, he entered the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for advaflced study. It was there that he entered a competition for a Hopwood Award, and that summer won a minor award for poetry. 

 In 1940 he married Erma Inez Morris. The following year they moved to Ann Arbor where Robert began graduate work in earnest and also took advantage of the opportunity to study with W. H. Auden, who at that time was visiting poet at the University of Michi gan. In 1940 Robert Hayden's first book of poetry Heart-Shape in the Dust was published by a small press in Detroit. 

 A daughter, Maia, was born in 1942, and that same year Robert won a major Hopwood Award for Poetry. He received a Master of Arts degree in English in 1944 and that fall was appointed 

Teaching Fellow in English. He

 held that position for two years, the first black person to have been given that opportunity  at the university. 

 In 1946 Robert and his family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he taught at Fisk University for twenty-two years. Meanwhile, he continued to write poetry, his first love. He could not find a publisher, but from time to time his poems would appear in magazines, including Atlantic Monthly and 

Poetry. In 1962 Ballad     

 of Remembrance was published in England. Then, between 

1966 and 1978, New York    

 publishers and others brought out Selected Poems, Words in the Mourning Time, Angle of Ascent, 

Night-Blooming Cereus      
and American  Journal.    

 These accomplishments led eventually  to other recognition: the reception of the Grand Prize for Poetry at the first World Festival of the Arts in Dakar, 

Senegal, 1965; the Russell 

 Loines Award for poetry, National Institute of 

Arts and Letters, 1970;    

 election by the Academy of American Poets as its 1975 Fellow; membership in the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters; and appointment (1976 — 1978) to the post of Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. — these are a few of the many honours given him. In the last-named post he was enabled to bring the Baha'i teachings to the attention of the manager of the Senate Chambers  and some other government officials. 

 On 3 January 1980 he was invited to the White House to read, along with other poets, and was received with genuine warmth by President  and Mrs. Carter. 

 Robert was not a joiner and past experience had made him wary of institutional religion. However, the Hand of the Cause Dorothy Baker, through the instrumentality of Katherine  Mills of Ann Arbor, had convinced him of the truth of the 

Cause of Baha'u'llah       

 and he joined the Faith in 1943. During his Baha'i life he served on the 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 of Nashville, Tennessee, and, while he held the consultantship at the Library of Congress, of

  Falls Church, Virginia. 

 He also spoke about the Faith many times on television and radio. 

 Robert was often asked to give talks on the Faith. 

 After a few such addresses he steadfastly refused these requests, firmly convinced that he could serve the Cause better as a poet. In this role he always strove for excellence. He received many requests to give readings of his poetry and always complied if it was at all possible. 

 Readings took him to many places in the United States. At these presentations he usually read poems he had written containing direct reference to the Faith as well as those on other subjects. He prefaced the readings with explanatory information about the 

Baha'i Revelation. Most    

 of all, however, wherever he went he was recognized by all who met him as one who promoted a universal point of view as found in the Faith of Baha'u'llah: whether in the classroom, on the lecture platform, or in social gatherings, this was the only view he held valid. In his work this also was true. 

 In a letter written to an inquirer in December 1970 he had this to say: 'I think of the writing of poems as one way of coming to grips with inner and outer realities — as a spiritual act, really, a sort of prayer for illumination and perfection. 

 The Baha'i Faith, with its emphasis on the essential oneness of mankind and its vision of world unity, is an increasingly power-hi influence on my poetry today — and the only one to which I willingly submit.' 

 From 1968 until his death Robert Hayden was an associate editor of World Order, a Baha'i periodical published under the aegis of the 

National Spiritual Assembly
of the United States.      

 H~ made constant efforts to raise the standard of the poetry used in the publication. World Order was very close to his heart, and he thought of his work for it as a real service he could render the Faith.

    ANGELINE GIACHERY          

 ? — 1980 Angeline Giachery, whose pure and angelic spirit returned to God on 23 April 1980, was born in Sweden towards the end of the nineteenth century. 

 The solemn beauty of her native land, bejewelled by thousands of rivers and lakes, and dotted with serenely tranquil and majestic forests, impressed itself upon her gentle spirit and found reflection in her stainless character. 

 Highly sensitive to the divine intelligence and exquisite harmony that rule the universe, she found perfection in all created things. 

 The inner happiness which suffused her being was crowned by her peerless  love for the Creator. Her childhood and adolescence were richly blessed and congenial. As a small child she studied music passionately and became an accomplished violinist. 

 She was educated in Sweden and England and was a diligent student who took delight in her studies. 

 She enjoyed the rational sciences —  particularly mathematics — liberal arts, literature  and the poetry of both countries. Travels

718                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  in Europe and abroad completed her education and widened her perspective, preparing her to make what she would later recognize as the supreme choice of her life. In the early 1920s she was introduced to the Revelation of Baha'u'llah while visiting friends in Boston, U.S.A. Her conversion was immediate, sincere and total: she dedicated the rest of her life to ardent service to the Cause of God and to bringing happiness to her fellow man. A short time later I met Angeline in the home of mutual friends; she was gentle, gracious, cultured, elegant and happy. In her presence one seemed to sense the fragrance of the pines and firs of the Varmiand forest, the most romantic and beautiful region of Sweden. We met frequently and a mutual affection developed. 

On 24 <February 1926      
we were married in New    

York City.                

 Now a considerable part of her time was spent in the company of early believers, many of whom had been in the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha.  Her heart was filled with joy and wonder. She gathered accurate notes and treasured the early translations of Sacred Writings that loving friends gave her. 

 Her knowledge of the Teachings became greater day by day. She attended meetings, lectures and classes and formed deep and lasting friendships with her fellow Bab6'is~ The early writings of the Guardian which were then becoming available enkindled her with n~w hope and inspiration. Her home was opened to seekers, firesides were maintained, and her melodious eloquence conquered many hearts. Increasingly immersing herself in the writings of Shoghi Effendi she preoccupied herself with the questions: How to serve the Cause more fully? How to multiply my efforts? She arranged music recitals to attract outstanding and influential people and her efforts were most successful. 

 Trips in America and Europe gave her the opportunity to spread the teachings  — seeds which were never lost — but as time went on the desire to pioneer in Europe or in Latin America was uppermost in her mind. 

 At the end of World War II she was able to leave for Rome, a city she had visited in her youth; she rejoiced at the thought of being closer to the Holy Land and to the Guardian whom she greatly revered and honoured with all her heart. Reaching Naples on 20 February 1947 she was distressed by the misery and destruction which were to be seen everywhere, and by the spectacle of countless cold and hungry children. After a twelve-hour journey on an ancient and overcrowded bus she reached the Eternal City. A cabled message from the Guardian — SUPPLICATING 

ABUNDANT  BLESSINGS NOBLE
MISSION — brought great cheer.

 Despite the difficulties life in wartorn Italy presented Angeline was able to establish herself, and by the end of March the first Italian believer was enrolled in Genoa. 

 A cable from the Guardian arrived on the thirty-first expressing HEARTFELT CONGRATULATIONS and uiging 

ALL OTHER PIONEERS EMULATE NOBLE

 EXAMPLE. It was signed, LOVING APPRECIATION, SHOGHI. The events of the years and months that followed were recorded by Angeline  in her diaries in which she poured out her supplications to God for greater assistance, her humble gratitude for His bounties and her happiness. 

 She looked up old friends; volunteered her services to an association that provided assistance to orphans and displaced persons; made contact with cultural groups, literary figures, art circles, embassies and the Dante Alighieri Society — always winning, with her gracious manner, new friends and interest in the Cause. 

 By Ridvan 1947, the anniversary of the foundation of Rome, electric lights came back in the streets; by RiQvdn 1948 the first 

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 of Rome was elected. Shoghi Effendi was overjoyed. 

 He requested a photograph of the Local Spiritual Assembly, had it framed and personally placed it at the head of his bed in the room he often occupied when staying overnight in the Mansion of Baha. 

 The need for Baha'i literature became evident. Angeline happily initiated a new activity, producing an introductory pdmphlet in Italian which was sent to prominent citizens and to four hundred public libraries. This was followed by a new edition of Dr. Esslemont's Baha'u'llah and the New Era, a special copy of which; bound in tooled green leather, was sent to the Guardian, who placed this, too, in his room at Baha. 

 Until 1964 when she returned to America, she served as chairman of the Italian Publishing Committee, a field which gave scope to her artistic and administrative skills. Under her direction and guidance


<p719>
IN MEMORIAM                719

  many of the major Writings of the Faith were translated into Italian and published in attractive  editions. 

 As the Faith became known throughout the entire Italian peninsula the Baha'i community grew and new centres were established on the mainland and the offshore islands. 

 Angeline became increasingly involved with travelling, teaching and encouraging the friends. 

 Following  the appointment• by the Guardian of the Hands of the Cause of God,1 and the creation of the Auxiliary Boards, she was appointed to the Auxiliary Board for the propagation of the Faith in Europe, serving in that capacity from Ridvan 1954 until her return to America in 1964. Her arena of service included not only Italy but Corsica, Malta, Rhodes, Greece, Monaco and Switzerland. The great tests of that period, including the passing of the beloved Guardian, challenged her capacity as she moved from one community to another, exhorting the friends to unity and faithfulness to the Covenant. Her tact, the immaculacy of her mind, and her strong awareness of divine assistance enabled her to maintain the integrity of the administrative order and inspire greater efforts among the believers, resulting in a considerable increase in their numbers. 

 Her assistance at the Italian end of the magnificent enterprise of securing materials for the construction of the superstructure of the Shrine of the Bab is inestimable, calling as it did for infinite patience, time and attention to detail, and extending from 1948 to the end of 1957. 

 Early in 1964 she began the painful task of detaching herself from the many friends she had made in Italy over the course of seventeen years; it was agonizing to leave all those she had guided into the Faith and with whom she had worked to build up sixteen Local 

Spiritual Assemblies.      

 Upon settling in La Jolla, California,  intensive teaching activities were undertaken,  including several firesides a week and travels that took her through Arizona, Oregon, Washington and as far north as the Yukon Territory of Canada where, north of Whitehorse,  a large cabin capable of holding forty students at a Baha'i school bears her name. Crossing to Alaska she captivated the affection  of the Indians; here the elders of a

 Giachery was appointed a Hand of the Cause on 

24 December 1951.          

 venerable clan, during a jubilant official ceremony, invested her with the title Princess of Ilingit Eagle Tribe — their escutcheon represents  a flying eagle. 

 She formulated at this time a plan to unite in the Faith all the people of the Arctic territories, from Finland to Alaska. 

At the Intercontinental    

 Conference in Helsinki in 1976 the plan again received some consideration.  After the conference she travelled to the Arctic region of Finland and on her return journey met with a serious accident which started her physical decline. 

 Undaunted, however, she travelled to Sweden and to the Arctic region of Norway, and the following year returned to the Arctic regions of Finland and 

Sweden.                    

 When she had taken her leave from the beloved 

Guardian on 23 December    

 1954 he had said that she would return to the Holy Land after the Archives building was completed but that in the meantime he wished her to travel and see the friends. Angeline promised herself  that from then on she would wholly dedicate herself to travelling and teaching. 

 In the years that followed she isited countless centres on five continents participating in every type of activity that circumstances demanded of her from simple fireside talks to the presentation of the book The Proclamation of 

Baha'u'llah to Pope Pius   
XII, to His Highness Malietoa
Tanumafihi II and to Umberto

II of Italy.               

 She grew frail in the last months of her life and sorrowed that she could no longer travel. Her end came suddenly, but until the very last moment the name of God was on her beautiful, smiling lips. Her mortal remains are now gathered in a befitting sepulchre in Cap d'AiI Cemetery, near Monaco, facing the blue Mediterranean Sea she was so fond of. 

 May present and future generations keep alive the memory of this true lover of God, and maidservant of Baha'u'llah

      CECILIA  MKJZE NODADA 1917 — 1

 980 Cecilia Mkize Nodada, whose nickname 'Zim-bili' means 'two' in her native Zulu tongue, was born on 21 November 1917 in Inanda, a


<p720>
720                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  village near Durban, South Africa. She studied nursing and worked in this profession for thirty-eight years. 

 She was considered an exemplary nurse by her professional colleagues.  In 1949 she married Baptin Nodada, a Xhosa, and they had eight children, four of whom later became Baha. 

 Cecilia and her husband constantly stressed the importance of education to the youth and, giving concrete form to their thought, they helped to pay the college fees of two young men who were distant relatives. 

 Cecilia was introduced to the Baha Faith through her father's sister, Bertha Mkize, who presented her with a copy of The New Garden; and Ruth Kubone, a member of the Auxiliary Board, also came to Umtata, Trans-kel,  to further her knowledge of the teachings. She finally signed her declaration card in Umtata on 23 August 1966, her aunt countersigning it as her teacher. At first Cecilia's heavy responsibilities as a nurse prevented her from being very active in Baha'i community life. 

 She was also, in her own words, 'one of those sleepy Baha'is who need deepening in order to become fully aware of the significance of the Faith'. This desirable deepening came in about 1974 as the result of a visit to Trans-kei  of two distinguished African teachers, Robert Mazibuko and Joyce Dwashu. As a result, Cecilia became enkindled with love for the Faith. She visited and deepened some of the friends in Northern Transkei, especially those near the village where she lived after retirement. 

 She was fluent in Zulu, Xhosa and English, and was fond of both reading and writing. She loved to teach but, unfortunately, she became ill when she did much travelling or walking. 

 This was probably an early sign of the cancer that would later develop. 

 She greatly enjoyed teaching children's classes — employing songs and plays — and strongly encouraged others to establish classes and showed them what to do. 

 She tried very hard, especially by example, to demonstrate to the friends in the rural areas how they could produce goods that could be later sold for cash to give to the Baha'i Fund. For instance, she grew beans and offered them for sale at the National Convention. 

 She encouraged the friends to use their money to go out and teach others about the Faith; at times she would also pay the bus fares of friends who wished to 

   Cecilia Mkize Nodada       

  make local teaching trips. 

 Cecilia was deeply loved by the friends in Transkei because of her warm and loving spirit. She was a quiet, modest and affectionate soul who was always surprising people with little gifts and presents. When she was not knitting for the Fund she was knitting special little gifts for the believers — right up to the last few weeks of her life. When friends forgot to write reports for the national committees, or hesitated to do so because of their poor skill in English, Cecilia would generously offer to do it for them. The friends felt that they had in Cecilia a kind friend who was concerned for their welfare and happiness and who loved them. 

    In 1976 the National Spiritual

 Assembly of South and West Africa appointed her to the National Teaching Committee. She served on this body, even though it required her making long trips to Johannesburg, until, in 1977, she was appointed a member of the Auxiliary Board for Propagation. However, just two years later she became very ill with cancer against which she battled valiantly for more than two years; to the limit of her strength she


<p721>
IN MEMORIAM                721

  was active right up to the last few months of her life. Her absence from the first national convention of Transkei was so deeply felt that Counsellor William Masehia paid her a visit, hoping to transport her in a car. This was not possible because of the advanced stage of her illness; it was apparent that she had only a few weeks of earthly life left. 

 One of her Baha'i daughters remarked that throughout her illness  Cecilia took comfort from the Baha'i song 

Angene Ndibuyele Umva      

 whose lyric attests 'I'll never turn back from being a Baha'i'. Finally, less than two weeks after the election of the first National Spiritual Assembly of Transkei, on 12 May 1980, in Dangwane village, our dear Cecilia followed the Messenger  of Joy and departed for the next world. The news of her passing saddened the whole Baha'i community of this region, especially Transkei and its newly-formed National Spiritual  Assembly, all of whose members attended her funeral on 16 May. There were hundreds of people present on that day. A bus-load of nurses in uniform attended, some of whom composed a guard of honour during the funeral while others made short addresses about her excellent work as a nurse. Two Christian ministers were present, both of whom offered prayers and praised her character. 

 Even in death Cecilia Nodada, the first Baha'i of Northern Transkei, was teaching; even two years after her funeral people who were present on that occasion are enquiring about the Faith she had espoused. Her life was an enactment of her favourite song, Angene 

Ndibuyele Umva.

ANNOUNCE PASSING MADAME    
OUTHEY FIRST BELIEVER      
TERRITORIES ON 20 MAY...   

  Having learned of the 

Baha'i Faith through Mariette

 Bolton1 of Australia, Jeannette Outhey — thought to be the first Caledonian believer — declared her faith in Thio, New Caledonia, on 10 June 1961. She became a great friend of the untiring Australian pioneer, Margaret Rowling, who found the first Melanesian believers in that French-speaking territory. 

 Jeannette took part actively in 1961 in the election of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Noumea and served on that body for nineteen consecutive years. Such was her enthusiasm that she even wanted to participate in the election of officers two weeks before her passing, although she was suffering painfully  from an incurable disease. In 1971, when the seat of the National Spiritual Assembly of the 

South West Pacific Ocean   

 was transferred from Honiara in the Solomon Islands to Noumea, Jeannette was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly which was composed of believers from New Hebrides, New Caledonia and 

Loyalty Islands. Reelected

 in 1972, she was able to make the trip of her life by going to the Holy Land the following year to attend the third Baha'i 

International Convention.  

 On the return journey she was also able to visit the resting-place of Shoghi Effendi before resuming her activities in New Caledonia. When her mother, the senior Baha'i of the Territories, passed away four years later, Jeannette became free to accept the position of custodian of the National Haziratu'1-Quds in Noumea, a sensitive function which she discharged with zeal, competence and love until her last days. 

 She made of this blessed spot a fragrant garden where local believers and transient guests enjoyed the generosity of her services, the affability of her character and her unequalled hospitality. 

 After having served the Cause of God for twenty years x(~ith love, devotion and perseverance,  and having proclaimed its ideals to people from all backgrounds and races, both in the Loyalty Islands and New Caledonia, and even in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Jeannette Outhey left this world under physical suffering but with mental

The memory of this great figure of the Faith in New Caledonia will for a long time remain engraved in the hearts of all those who had the joy of knowing her.

 tually excelled in these languages. He corresponded a number of times with the Guardian. While still a young man he became a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of BaghdAd and then was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of 'IrAq. 

 In 1953 at the beginning of the Ten Year Plan he arose as a pioneer to the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean for which he was named a Knight of Baha'u'llah by Shoghi Effendi.1 

 He remained there for approximately three months until forced to return to 'IrAq due to his inability to obtain a residence permit. 

 In 'Jr~q he steadfastly served the Cause. He was sent on a number of missions to neighbouring  Arab states at the instructions of the beloved Guardian, especially to Lebanon to which he travelled several times. He represented the National Spiritual Assembly of 'Irdq at a number of Baha'i Intercontinental Conferences and he likewise represented the Cause at several nonpolitical conferences sponsored by the United Nations. 

 Within the Baha community he was a patient and From his youth my late father took the service of the Baha'i Cause as his principal aim. After completing his primary and secondary studies he began his Baha service as a member of the     Kamil Abbas youth comniittee of BaghdAd. He began to study Persian, English and German and even1  See Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World, p. 52.

  exemplary believer, courageously defending the Faith, diffusing its wisdom among the friends, and respected and honoured by them. In 1957 he was appointed to the Auxiliary Board for the protection of the Cause. On a number of occasions his Baha'i service took him to India and Pakistan and in 1966 he spent some time in fr6n. He assisted Mr. 

Muhammad Iuiusayn RawhAni1 

 in the delicate task of transferring the remains of the father of Baha'u'llah, 

Mirza Buzurg, to a Baha'i  

 cemetery.2  He also carried out, upon the instructions of Shoghi Effendi, various assignments relating to historic Baha'i sites in BaghdM. For nearly twenty years he served as secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of 'IAq. 

 After his return from Tihr6n in 1967 he remained in BaghdAd due to the difficulty of travelling abroad. It was the will of God that he be one of the faithful friends who were arrested in Decembgr 1973 and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was so firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Blessed Beauty that the prison authorities watched my father carefully. At times they oppressed him and at times tried to persuade him to recant, but without avail. My father's course was to be firm in the service of the Faith of Baha'u'llah to cling to His ordinances, and to proffer obedience and fidelity to the Universal House of Justice. A few months after he left the prison his health weakened, and on 5 June 1980 his spirit ascended to the AbhA Kingdom. It was my father's wish during the last years of his life to write a book on the blessed Cause and we may be certain that only his imprisonment prevented him from carrying out his intention. He ascended from this transitory life firm in the truth of 

God's mighty Cause.

 1957 in Panama and almost immediately arose to serve as a pioneer in the Chitr6 zone where she gave her services with great dedication and efficiency. In the closing years of the Ten Year Crusade there was an urgent appeal for pioneers to Nicaragua. In the period between May 1960 and April 1961 a contingent of pioneers arrived, including Cecilia. She had been on the front Lines in the teaching field for more than a decade in Panama and on several occasions served as a member of the National Spiritual 

Assembly.


<p724>
724                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Her activities in Nicaragua were described in the 

Panama Baha'i Bulletin    

 of July 1980: 'A Panamanian pioneer of great enthusiasm and joy, she arose to serve at fifty years of age, leaving Panama to offer her valuable services in Nicaragua and help in the formation of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Bluefields, a very important factor in making possible the simultaneous election, in the memorable year 1961, of all the National Spiritual Assemblies of Latin America. From the moment she arrived at her pioneer post, "Miss Cecilia" as she was affectionately called by the local people whose confidence, love and esteem she immediately won, began to work for the Cause of Baha'u'llah, opening up every type of activity, including children's classes, literacy classes and firesides. She made long-distance, hazardous teaching trips to inhospitable places all along the Nicaraguan coast, carrying high the banner of the Most Great Name and proclaiming the healing message of the Baha'i Faith in mountainous and rural areas.' 

 It is difficult to describe the wonderful work she carried out in the Department of Zelaya, Nicaragua. 

 There she worked expanding the foundation of the Faith, deepening the believers  and consolidating communities which were separated, in some instances, by distances  of more than a day's journey over rivers, through jungles and along coastal beaches. 

 The task was difficult but her spirit was indomitable in the service of the Cause. By great economic sacrifice she purchased in Rio Esconclido a considerable piece of fertile land — a veritable paradise Whose silence is broken oniy by the lapping of the sea waves —  and donated it to the National Spiritual Assembly of Nicaragua with the hope that it would in future be the site of a permanent Baha'i Institute. 

 In spite of her health, which was weakened by the difficulties of climate and food and her exhausting work among the indigenous people whom she loved dearly, Cecilia was always ready not only to teach the Baha'i Faith but to defend it, even at the cost of her own life if circumstances should demand it. Her hand was always extended to assist the sick, protect the helpless and share her meagre bread with the hungry. She saw all the indigenous people as her children and at any moment would have given her life for them. Her heart was so large and generous that it almost would not fit in her chest. 

 So exhausting were the conditions under which she laboured that her health broke down under the strain. One day we received her at the airport in Managua in a very serious condition and practically unconscious.  It took two months for her to recover from that illness, and as soon as she regained a little strength, in spite of our pleas that she take a rest, she returned to her pioneer post because, she said, her indigenous friends needed her. 

    During the 1970s Cecilia  

 settled in Costa Rica and continued teaching the Cause of Baha'u'llah with The same enthusiasm and dedication as before, in spite of age and broken health. Even from her sickbed during her last days in this world she continued spreading the divine fragrances. 

 The Baha of three countries — Panama, Nicaragua and Costa Rica — grieved at her passing on 27 June 1980, because upon the believers in those lands she had lavished the intense love of her great heart. DEPLORE

IN MEMORIAM                725

    JOHN WILLIAM ALLEN         
        1907 — 1980                  

  Knight of Baha'u'llah      

  He knew very little of his new home. So when he and his wife Valera arrived at the border of Swaziland in a rented car on 19 April 1954, they had with them full camping provisions; though they never had to use them. They were responding to a letter from Shoghi Effendi urging them to take up residence in a virgin Baha'i territory before the end of the first year of the Ten Year Crusade. God had granted their wish to join the legions of the 

Knights of Baha'u'llah.   

 At that time they had no way of knowing that Swaziland would be their home for the rest of their lives. Nor could they know that this colonial territory would emerge as an independent nation before John's death on 31 August 1980, with more than 5,000 Baha'is; with its own National Spiritual Assembly iecognized by the government; with national, regional and local Baha'i Centres; with the Leroy Joas Baha'i Teaching Centre named after John's longtime friend and confidant; and with other endowments. 

 Behind this spiritual triumph, guided always by Shoghi Effencli with whom the Aliens had extensive correspondence and whom they visited while on pilgrimage in 1954, is the life-story  of a man with the clear vision that the Cause of God must be the beacon toward which his entire life must be oriented to give it meaning and direction and success. 

 John Allen was born on 16 May 1907 in Auburn, California. His talent for organization and kadership emerged early. As a teenager he took full frsponsibiLity for managing a fruit orchard when his father fell ill. ~He was an excellent athlete and played on the football team at the College of the Pacific. 

 He married at the beginning of the great depression and supported his family during those very difficult years through his initiative, imagination and tenacity as an automobile salesman. 

 In 1945 he opened his own automobile dealership which grew and prospered until he left to pioneer to 

Swaziland.                 

 John's relationship to the Cause of Baha'u'llah developed through his marriage. His wife, Valera, had become a Baha in 1925, well before they had even met. A year after their marriage they moved to Sacramento. When the only Baha'i couple in that town came to call, they simply assumed that John was a Baha'i and he joined in the teaching activities. 

 In those days there were no enrolment  cards. 

 His business skills in bidding on government surplus at the end of World War II were put to use to serve the Faith. 

 He secured for the Baha faith registration as a charitable organization. 

 Under this registration the Baha'is were able to purchase government surplus at more than a ninety per cent discount on bid price. In his capacity as chairman of the Maintenance Committee at the Geyser-yule Baha'i School, he equipped the school, from dormitories to kitchen, for almost nothing. 

 John Allen was a builder both of physical edific& and spiritual communities, and the two came together in his service to the 

Faith in Southern Africa.  

 He was never happier than on the frequent occasions when he negotiated for a particularly difficult purchase of land, or the permits to build, or was able to lay out a new building. It was even his good fortune to be in Haifa when the Guardian asked the


<p726>
726                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Hand of the Cause of God Ugo Giachery to lay out the position of the Archives Building. John helped Dr. Giachery drive the stakes and stretch the strings which marked the location of the first building to arise on the Arc around which will be located the international institutions of the World 

Order of Baha'u'llah.       
    He was a generous man.     

 He helped pioneers settle in Swaziland, obtaining lists of employment  opportunities, corresponding with pioneer committees, negotiating for residence permits, jobs, housing, cars, and often inviting newly-arrived  pioneers to accept the hospitality of his home. Many times he contributed material support to make it possible for them to remain in Swaziland. 

 He assisted with the education of many young Swazi students, some of whom lived in his own home. 

 Automobiles were a ]ifetime preoccupation. As a high school student he built his own 'buggy' from the frame up, selling it to raise funds for college. 

 Cars were designed for use and he did not spare them. In the early days when there were no paved roads in Swaziland he might drive more than an hour one way over very rough roads to collect a Swazi Baha'i to attend a Nineteen Day Feast or a group of seekers to come to a fireside, repeating the journey when he took them home the same evening. 

 Years later he wore out two trucks, even as his own health was failing, carting the materials and supervising the construction of two regional Baha'i 

Centres, in Hlatikulu      

 and Piggs' Peak, each a two-hour drive. He was appointed to the first Auxiliary Board by the Hand of the Cause M6sA Banhni with responsibility for Northern and Southern Rhodesia, 

Nyasaland and Mozambique.  

 Travelling  in those countries over difficult roads he would sometimes carry a full set of tyres on the roof-rack to prevent delays. One of his strong points was his ability to anticipate both needs and consequences in the most diverse of circumstances. 

 As well as assisting in the spiritual development of Swaziland, John sought, with two of his sons, to participate in its economic advancement by rescuing a moribund pineapple industry. A noteworthy achievement was the establishment of a Swazi Farmers' Pineapple Settlement Scheme under which Swazi farmers, for the first time ever, were enabled to purchase and operate their own pineapple farms. 

 In the early teaching plans of the Guardian, the task of building world order fell to few hands. 

 While in the United States John served on the Geyserville 

School Committee, the National
Youth Committee and the    

National Teaching Committee.

 At the beginning of the Ten Year Crusade, when he was a member of the Asian Teaching Committee, he would laugh and say it was the committee's job to send Baha'i pioneers to countries and islands neither they nor anyone on the committee had ever heard of. Nonetheless, he and his fellow committee members succeeded in turning naYve intentions of devoted Baha'is into the reality of service. As always, he was a salesman, with the gift of convincing people of their worth and their ability to accomplish things they feared to hope for, and to serve in ways they did not dream to be possible. 

 And then he came to Swaziland to become an example of what is possible if you have the courage to try and the determination to stay with it. The Faith quicklj took root and the early Swazi believers were carefully nourished and deepened. Several members of the Royal Family became 

Baha'is. Soon a Regional National

 Spiritual Assembly was formed for Southern Africa and he served as a member of that body, and of its daughter National Spiritual Assembly in Swaziland, for many years. Through triumph and heartbreak, John and Valera persisted at their post for more than a quarter-century. The Cause of God continues to grow in Swaziland, nurtured by the efforts at various times of almost a hundred pioneers, but increasingly its destiny must lie in the hands of the local believers taught so carefully and well. 

 John was the head of a large, active Baha'i family, in addition to being an example of service to the Baha world. His three sons, with their wives, have all served as Baha pioi~eers. All eleven of his grandchildren are active in their service to the Faith as pioneers, travelling teachers and members of National and Local 

Spiritual Assemblies.      

 John lived to see the birth of his first great granddaughter at the pioneering post of her parents in 

Zimbabwe.                  

 John Allen was a member of the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Swaziland      

 when he died at Stanford, California, while on a visit to

On 19 October 1906 Sarah   

 Florence Parry was born in Wrexham, Wales. Her family emigrated  to Australia when she was six years old. 

 Florence became a teacher in the Education Department of South Australia. In 1927 a fellow-teacher, Miss Bertha Mochan (who later, as Mrs. Bertha Dobbins, became the Knight of Baha'u'llah for the New Hebrides) invited her to a meeting in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Hyde-Dunn in North Adelaide, Florence asked her friend, Harold Fitzner,1 to accompany her, and they became regular attendants at these meetings. The sincerity and love of the couple who became affectionately known in the Australian Baha'i community  as 'Father and Mother Dunn', and the truth and beauty of the Baha'i Writings, deeply affected Florence and Harold. In 1928 they embraced the Cause. 

 In 1931 Florence married Harold Fitzner; this was one of the first Baha marriages in Australia. 

 They held firesides in their home regularly and many enquirers who attended subsequently accepted the Faith. Florence was a hardworking teacher of the Baha'i Faith. Accompanied by her husband she undertook much extension teaching in country towns of South Australia, in addition to serving on the Local Spiritual Assembly of Adelaide, supporting various meetings at the Baha'i Centre, assisting with children's classes, visiting the sick and elderly and other activities. They attended the Intercontinental 

Conference  in New Delhi  

 in 1953 where, in response to the great call issued by Shoghi Effendi for believers to arise and go to the virgin territories, they offered their services as pioneers to Portuguese Timor. Many difficulties had to be overcome before they reached their pioneering goal but with much prayer, persistence and dedicated effort Harold arrived in Portuguese Timor in June 1954; Florence joined him four months later. 

 After his arrival he met distrust

  and opposition from some of the authorities and Florence helped to make life easier for Harold by sharing the problems and the tasks of daily living. Florence and Harold were honoured by the Guardian with the title, Knights of Baha'u'llah.' 

 In time, opposition was overcome and they were accepted through their lives of loving service. 

 They taught English to many students — Portuguese, Chinese, Timorese, Arabs and others of mixed blood — and created a schoolroom in their new house which was built in Diii. These students, many of whom later went abroad for further study, also learned from the Fitzners about the 

Baha'i Faith. The Faith   

 could not be taught openly in Portuguese Timor but, as the years passed, some of the local people embraced it. Harold's deteriorating health became a cause of great concern for Florence. After a protracted period of illness he died at his post in 1969. 

 Love for the Faith and for the Timorese people prompted Florence to remain serving in Timor and to continue teaching English. 

 In 1973 she was privileged to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. She made occasional visits to Adelaide for dental and medical reasons and it was during one of these visits in 1974 that revolution broke out, making it unwise for her to return to her beloved Timor where she had served for twenty years. She continued teaching the Faith and supporting Baha'i activities in her own and other areas of Australia, and in 1978 went as a travelling teacher to Tonga, Fiji and both islands of New Zealand. 

 Health problems gradually prevented her from doing all she would have liked to have done in service to the Cause she loved so dearly. Florence passed to the AbhA Kingdom on 7 

September 1980. After     

 her passing the following cable was sent by the

LOUIS PIERRE HENRI DUACOO 

 1930 — 1980 Pierre Dhacoo was born on 16 February 1930 in Mauritius and was a member of a devout Christian family whose beliefs he adopted. On 1 March 1961 he accepted the Baha'i Faith, expressly desiring to declare his acceptance on that day so that he could begin his Baha'i life by observing the Fast. Despite the oppositipn and dis~tpprova1 of friends and relatives he served the Faith selflessly and unceasingly from the moment he embraced it. At first his employer expressed concern at his involvement  with the Baha'i community but Pierre's loyalty, integrity and devotion to duty soon caused his employer to change his attitude to one of appreciation and respect. 

 The nature of Pierre's employment required him to travel extensively during the day but he was never too tired at day's end to undertake teaching trips for the Faith. 

 He discharged any task entrusted to him with a high sense of dedication, performing it to the best of his ability. Many were guests in his home, and many in need or in distress would knock at his door knowing that he would extend any

  assistance within his power. He was admired for his devotion to his family and for his constant willingness to extend help to those within and without the Baha'i community. He was eVen-tempered, bumble and courteous, and nothing would dampen his spirit. He had the gift of seeing the humorous aspects of ordinary situations, and the anecdotes he would relate at Unity Feasts and social gatherings lightened all hearts. 

 He was an enthusiastic teacher, capable of presenting the Glad Tidings in simple and moving language. He served on the Local Spiritual 

Assembly of Port Louis    

 and on the National Teaching Committee. He was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly in 1968 and was a member of that body until his death. His service on these institutions was rendered in an unassuming and quiet yet dynamic way. 

 His passing on 5 October 1980 deprived the Mauritian Baha'i community of one of its most valued servants. 

 He was a dearly loved friend, a faithful coworker and a true Baha'i brother. 

 He leaves a wife and five children who have all espoused the Faith. 

 In a letter written on its behalf on 3 November 

1980 the Universal House  

 of Justice expressed sorrow at the passing of 'an outstanding believer and devoted servant of the Cause of Baha'u'llah'.

 While still a young man he was lured north to Alaska where he settled in Cordova and trained as a meteorologist. After completing his training, he travelled to all the weather stations throughout Alaska as a relief meteorologist. 

 While stationed at Point Barrow, he first heard about the Baha Faith from a pioneer, Frances Wells.1 She introduced me to Karl just before she left to pioneer once again, this

 I discovered while talking with Karl that I had been binding his library collection on Alaska through the local book store. After that he brought his books directly to me. Dutifully, I sent him Baha'i literature and notices while he manned weather stations out in the tundra. For my birthday, he sent his Baha'i enrolment card. 

 The next summer we were married. 
     Karl was active on the    

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 of Spenard and was a popular speaker and chairman for public meetings. 

 He became the executive member of the Alaska National 

Book Sales Committee.     

 Through him, the book sales were enlarged to include publications from Baha'i publishers around the world. In 1960 he was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska but in the same year the weather bureau sent him to Washington, D.C., for additional training in personnel work. 

 In 1970 Alaska was requested to send pioneers to Swaziland. 

 Karl, myself and my daughter, Deanne, volunteered for this assignment.  We became the first caretakers of the

 serve the Cause of God; but among these were service on Local Spiritual Assemblies, pioneering, travel-teaching on the homefront and abroad, and service on committees. 

 She was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly for ten years and was its secretary for eight, until her appointment as Auxiliary Board member for protection in 1978.' It was during this time that her fullest and richest service was rendered, based as it was on a depth of knowledge of the principles of Baha administration combined with her natural capacity for winning the confidence of the friends and of tendering them advice and guidance. 

 In an entry in her diary in 1949 Alexe confided her concern for her children who were born of parents of different races: 'Miscegenation is not an easy thing and sometimes I am hurt to the quick by what people say and sometimes I wonder "What have I done? Have I harmed these children? They are neither Cell nor Maori. 

 As they grow up will the social distinctions — and they are quite definite — embitter them, influence them? 

 So many problems! May God help us   ' Sorrow was changed to joy when she discovered the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Alexe later wrote: 'Well, God did help and heaped the mercy and bounty of recognizing Baha'u'llah on my heart and the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha were sweet to my eyes, The lovers of mankind, these are the superior men, of whatever race, creed or colour they may be. To have been able to share the dignity, the wisdom, the love of these words with my children was the greatest moment of my life.' 

 Alexe worked tirelessly all through the years to bring the message of Baha'u'llah to the Maori.people. 

 She had a great respect and love for them and prayed that this noble race would respond wholeheartedly to the Baha Cause. She wrote and published Te Marama (The Light), a simplified introduction to the Faith which reflected her love for the Cause of Baha'u'llah and the Maori people. 

 In June 1980 she was enabled to make a brief visit to the Holy Land and finally she returned to her native highlands and the relatives of her, youth. On 11 October 1980, shortly before she was due to come home to New Zealand, she died at Fort William, Scotland, and is buried at Kilmarcie Cemetery. She is remembered for her very strong sense of humour, her sense of justice and keenness of mind. On 12 October the

     (SHAH BAHA'I MQBJDZADI}-I) 

 1901 — 1980  

Shah Beliram Mobedzadeh    

 was an exemplary Baha — devout, self-sacrificing, sincere in his love for the friends and utterly devoted to the Faith. I first met him in Karachi in 1936. 

 His face was spiritual, his eyes luminous, and his language was an exalted Persian, sweet and inspiring. 

 I was strongly attracted to him at first sight. 
We met frequently thereafter.

 In all meetings he spoke of the Faith, its greatness and glorious history; and of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the beloved Guardian. He also spoke with great admiration of the early believers of India. It was my good fortune to travel in his company in 1975 and I availed myself of the opportunity of learning as much as I could of his life and of his record of service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 He was born on 25 January 1901 into a Zoroastrian family. His ancestors had been priests since the time of Zoroaster. 

 His father, however, left his ancestral occupation and became an importer, trading in goods from India. 

 Shah Behram was named by his father's sister who was reported to have said, during the naming ceremony, 'God willing, he will

  Shah Behram Mobedzadeh     

  live to see the Promised One foretold by 

•Zoroaster "ShAh Bahram    
Varj4vand" ("The Glory     

 of God").' Shah Behram felt that her hope was fulfilled when he accepted the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 When he was sixteen Shah Behram was sent to the house of his sister in IsfalPn in order to perfect his Persian. He learned of the Baha Faith through the great teacher Mdii TihrThi whose scholarship and good character deeply impressed him, and in 1925 he became a Baha'i. 'Immediately thereafter', Shah Behram told me, 'I addressed a letter to the beloved Guardian expressing my utmost obedience and signed myself Shah Behram slo (son of) Mobed Khuda Bux. Back came a reply in the name of Shah Behram Mobedzadeh. 

 This will explain my surname "Mobedzadeh" which I accepted forthwith.' 

 In 1928 Shah Behrarn came to India with letters of introduction and worked in restaurants,  first in Bombay and then in Calcutta, although for a few months he was penniless and near despair. In January 1932 he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and was privileged to be in the presence of Shoghi 

Effendi.                   

 Speaking of this experience later, Shah Behram remarked that the Guardian was so kind to everyone that each pilgrim felt that he had been singled out to be the recipient of a special measure of Love, greater than that bestowed upon the others. 'I cannot describe my parting from the beloved Guardian,' he said, 'for my eyes were veiled with tears. 

 He was filled with understanding and consoled me, emphasizing that I should meet the friends and impress upon them that nothing is more important than teaching and guiding seekers to the Cause. This I did both in India and 

IrAn. Shoghi Effendi       

 would ask me to chant and generously made a kind reference to me, saying that some Zoroastrian priests had accepted the Faith before me, but~ that I was the first among them to espouse. it openly.' 

 Shah Behram thenceforth became a tireless worker for the Faith — travelling, encouraging, inspiring. 

 In 1941 he married Ridvan KMnum, the daughter of the distinguished Behman Behi, whose entire life had been devoted to the Faith. 

 In 1945 she became caretaker of the children's hostel in Panchgani. The original hostel which housed twelve children grew to become The New 

Era High School where RidvTh

 continues to serve as superintendent. In 1964 Shah Behram was appointed a member of the Auxiliary Board and in this capacity travelled all over India. In his seventy-fifth year he remarked, 'I do not feel the sting of age. I derive inspiration from the example of the late Hand of the Cause Tar6zu'lhh Samandari who even in his nineties travelled in service to the Faith like a young man. I know that there is only one joy in life — to surrender everything to Baha'u'llah, to live for Him and die for Him.' 

 During the last two years of his life he was often confined to bed but in spirit he was always preparing to travel and was full of plans to advance the work of the Faith. He spoke only of the greatness of the Cause, the lives of the martyrs, the services of the Hands of the Cause of God, and described interesting and inspiring situations that arose in his lifetime. On 17 October 1980 he bade farewell to all and started his journey in the world of immortals. The Universal House of Justice paid him a glowing tribute in its cable of 23 October:

      LEONORA STIRLING ARMSTRONG

 1895 — 1980 Rio de Janeiro: At dawn on 1 February 1921, the S. S. Vasari plowed through sparkling waters into the majestic harbor. 

 Below deck, in second-class accommodation, watching, stood an attractive, cultured young woman, a lone American. 

 In her heart she nourished the vision of an unspeakably glorious mission, the spread of the Light of God in this day to an entire continent. In her purse, all her savings, barely enough for two weeks' modest expenses. No friends in the city, no job. 
She spoke no Portuguese.  

 Odd circumstances for one who so readily confessed a lack of self-confidence. Clearly her reliance was placed elsewhere. 

  Panama City: Half a century later at an international conference held in connection with the dedication of the first Baha'i House of Worship in Latin America, this same slight and soft-spoken woman — Leonora Stirling Armstrong — was presented to the thousands of believers gathered there. 

 Spontaneously they rose to pay tribute to her achievements. What emotions must have surged within her weakened frame, now bent with long toil, as she surveyed these children of her dream. 

 For here were fervent followers of Baha'u'llah raised up from every country of Latin America, of every color, clime and custom. 

 Here was her vision made real; like Saint Peter she cast the seeds, and now witnessed a heavenly harvest. Heartbreaks and anxiety; aches, pains and fevers — how they all took on divine meaning. 

  *        * 

Leonora Stirling Armstrong

  On 23 June 1895, in a pleasant two-story house, high on a rise overlooking the Hudson River and the Catskill range beyond, a first child was born to Samuel Norris Holsapple and his beautiful wife, Grace Stirling. They named her 

Leonora. The Holsapples   

 were wellknown in the then little town of Hudson, New York, where they had settled after their marriage. 

The gifted Mrs. Holsapple 

 served actively in civic work, and had taught school. 

  The childhood of Leonora was, however, soon overshadowed with tragedy and sadness, for her mother's health steadily declined. Just after her precious daughter's fifth birthday she died. 

 Mrs. Holsapple's untimely death had a profound effect on Leonora and her younger sister, Alethe. They never again had what could truly be called a home. 'How we could endure', Leonora herself recounts, 'through those years of our childhood and adolescence, such loneliness, such suffering, even cruelty, I do not know I can remember how when still a small child, often at night before going to bed, I knelt down at my sister's bedside and in agony of soul, implored God with all the intensity of my being to let us feel His Presence, His nearness, His protection.

  did I then dream in what way, and how specifically, that prayer was later to be answered!'1 Despite her suffering Leonora was a gifted student all through her childhood. 

 In her high school graduating class she received the highest honors and was made valedictorian. She was able to enter Cornell University on a scholarship, and was elected Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year. 

 Though she attended church from an early age, Leonora was somewhat disillusioned by what she experienced there. When she was about thirteen her maternal grandmother, 'Mother Stirling', who had by then after long years of spiritual searching found and embraced the Baha'i Faith, first began to teach her granddaughters the truths of the New Day. The example of Mother Stirling's devotion and many efforts to spread the Baha'i teachings made a lasting impression on Leonora's sensitive nature. She was greatly attracted to the new Revelation and began to memorize passages  and prayers frym the Writings. Already at that time she made her own efforts to share the Message with her classmates and friends. 

 After graduation from college she taught Latin in high schools and was active in social work as her mother and grandmother had been before her. During this period she came in close contact with a number of prominent early believers, among them the Obers and, in particular, May Maxwell. 'May, more than anyone else, helped me to feel the great love of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, the reality of love, which I had longed to feel, and a deep bond was formed between us, which gave me the greatest joy I had known.'2 Others, too, such as Roy Wilhelm and the Kinneys, inspired her with their immense devotion to the Faith. 

 The desire to pioneer first stirred in Leonora's soul when 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets of the Divine Plan were unveiled at the Baha'i Convention held in New York in 1919. Spontaneously, and at once, she wrote to the Master, offering herself in service. Thou hadst, was His reply, expressed thy great wish to be of service to the Divine Threshold and to heal the infirm with the Divine Panacea — the infirm who is afflicted with passion and self Spiritual malady is more severe than physical illness for it may be that 1 Unpublished memoirs. 

 2 ibid. the latter may be converted by the least remedy into health and vigor, while the former will not be cured by a thousand wellknown remedies •   My hope is that thou mayest become a spiritual physician A As Leonora recounts it: 'This hope of the Master's became my highest aspiration and when, early in 1920, I read His Tablet to Martha Root, commending her teaching work in South America and stressing the importance of its being followed up by others, it at once seemed to me that here there might be a definite task for me. A letter to Martha brought an immediate reply, with all encouragement.'4 Martha Root had opened South America with her historic visit there in 1919. 

 Her response to Leonora was wholehearted. She shared thrilling accounts of her experiences and gave her young recruit a copy of her own diary notes from that period. Brazil was finally decided on as the best place to go first. 

 The grave concerns of relatives and friends alike now assailed her: to expose herself to the dangers and rigors of such a far-off country, much of it a jungle, alone, friendless, and without knowledge of the language — why it was nothing less than foolhardy! 'I felt my resolution weakening, when some social work in the northern part of New York State gave me the sudden idea to slip up to Montreal to consult May Maxwell. 

 Although ill, May, on hearing the situation, sat upright in bed and in ringing tones which still vibrate in my memory, said, "Leonora, what are you waiting for? ~~•~""J will take the next boat," I replied.'5 And so it was that on 15 January 1921 she set sail from New York on a divine adventure destined to span no less than sixty years. In doing so, she became one of a handful of valiant souls who arose in response to 'Abdu'l-Baha's call during His Own lifetime, and the first Baha'i pioneer to settle permanently in Latin America. 

 Had not the Master promised confirmation to those souls who, like unto Peter and Paul, would journey to South America with the requisite qualities of 'perfect severance, devotion,  firmness and steadfastness in the Covenant'?6  Leonora knew this meant severance Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha,

  'from dearest friends, comforts, profession, from everything " Martha Root had herself  impressed this upon her. And now she was to be surrounded and sustained by such divine confirmations. 

 Leonora's original intention had been to proceed from Rio to Baha, the northeastern city mentioned by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of the Divine Plan — the only city so blessed in the southern hemisphere. But the way opened shortly after her arrival in Rio to teach the Faith in Santos to the south. There she stayed with a family who, in a letter to Martha Root, had expressed interest in knowing more about the Faith. Her quarters were very humble but it was a start. 

 Life in her land of spiritual adoption was never easy. 

 She often suffered from loneliness, meagre means, malnutrition and illness. Gradually as she became proficient in the Portuguese language, she was better able to support herself. Still, it required long working hours, sometimes at several jobs just to keep body and soul together. She found teaching English, which was the main avenue open to her, to be a valuable way of meeting people and interesting them in the 

Faith.                     

 Just three months after settling in Santos, Leonora learned of the loss of her beloved grafidmother, the spiritual mother of her heart. Later that same Vear a profounder grief overtook her when news came of the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. She had so intensely longed to meet Him in this life. Providentially, from Baha in June 1921, 'Abdu'l-Baha had revealed a second Tablet for her. 

 This Tablet became a source of great comfort to her not only in that time of tragedy but throughout the long years ahead. 

 The Master had addressed the envelope simply: 'Brazil. 
To the Maidservant of      

God, Leonora Stirling      
Holsapple.' Amazingly      

 it reached her, as the Master no doubt knew it would. In the text He refers to Leonora as a Herald of the Kingdom, calls upon her to thank God that thou hast enlightened thy sight, and art giving light to the sight of others, too, refers by name to a number of seekers, and promises that the intoxicated friends will grow in rapture and ecstasy, begin to break into melodies and harmonies  and raise such a tune that will reach the Supreme Concourse and rejoice and exhilarate Unpublished memoirs. 

 the holy ones. He, likewise, advises her to say that the entering into this Divine Cause is accompanied by everlasting honor and eternal 2 sovereignty. 

 'Soon the beloved Guardian's messages began to reach me, urging me never to become discouraged, rather to redouble my efforts, and guiding me with his unfailing wisdom.'3 Indeed, throughout his ministry Shoghi Effendi's esteem for her and her services was clearly evident. 

 His love for her and his warm encouragement of her work lasted till the end of his life and are recorded in the tender words he. addressed to her in many letters: 'I feel deeply attached to your work.'4 'Your name I assure you will adorn the annals of the Cause and will inspire many a Baha'i pioneer in future. You cannot realize the splendour and significance of the work you are doing at present.'5 'I will pray that you may be guided and fortified by the spirit of our beloved Master Who I am sure is guiding you, watching over you and sustaining you in your labours. Persevere and never lose heart.'6 A survey of Leonora Armstrong's tireless pioneer activities must necessarily span six decades of continual service. Her achievement~ marked a high tide of human endeavor. Whether in her constant teaching of individuals,  her historic travels, the publicity she garnered for the Cause wherever she went, her herculean labor of translating, publishing and disseminating Baha'i literature both in Portuguese and Spanish, her work in spreading the Message through correspondence, or her eventual material contributions to the community, she stands out eminently distinguished.  Through the years she also engaged in social service whenever possible, and became known in the press as the 'Nurse of the Poor'. 

 The first decade of these activities is marked by extraordinary travels. 

 Twice during the ten years, her father sent funds for a return visit to New York. By careful economy she was able to visit many places along the way. By sailing 2  tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha,

  third class, she included countries not on her route. 

 In this way she was able to emblazon the Cause of God in city after city up the Brazilian coast, into the heartland of the Amazon basin, and throughout the Caribbean Sea. 

 Between these travels she raised the banner of the Faith in S~o Paulo, in Rio and particularly in Baha through extended stays. A number of souls were attracted to the beauty of the Teachings. Alone in Manaus on the Amazon River, to cite one instance, during a short visit she proclaimed the Faith to 3,400 souls in public meetings and school gatherings. 

 In 1927 she became the first Baha to visit and speak of the Cause in Colombia, Venezuela, Cura§ao, Trinidad, Barbados, Haiti, 

British Guiana and Dutch   

 Guiana, thus complementing and completing Martha Root's unfulfilled intention of raising the Call of God in all the Latin American countries. The visits of this pure, selfeffacing soul, so modest in her personal life, were, paradoxically, always amply reported in the press. And she often enjoyed the spontaneous cooperation and support of various organizations in arranging public meetings. 

 All this occurred in some places within hours of her arrival! 

 During her stay in Santos Leonora began her prodigious and historic task of translating Baha'i literature into Portuguese; at first it was a simple pamphlet to distribute at her talks — often typed over and over on her small portable typewriter — later, as her skills developed, an intense outpouring of the major works of the Faith. In the end she had rendered into Portuguese a wide range of literature, and for several decades, under the guidance and with the generous assistance of Shoghi Effendi, had personally seen to its publication. 

When a, Baha'i Publishing  

 Trust was founded in Rio, and the National Spiritual Assembly of Brazil came into being in 1961, she worked closely with these institutions, adding such long and weighty works as God Passes By and The Dawn-Breakers to her already highly-distinguished record of accomplishments. 

 By the late 1920s, having made many contacts in 

Spanish-speaking countries, Leonora

 was increasingly concerned with producing adequate Spanish translations as well. She decided to proceed to Spain for a course of study in the 

University of Madrid       
to better equip herelf.    

 In July 1930 she boarded a French ship which first took her to several ports of call in West Africa and then to Barcelona. 

 As always she taught along the way; From Barcelona she proceeded to Madrid where through her efforts she was able to found the first Baha'i group of Spain. As she fell seriously ill for a time, she was unable to enter the course at the University and shortly felt inspired to ask the Guardian for permission to come to the Floiy Land and visit the Baha'i Holy Places. 

 He cabled her MOST WELCOME on 2 Noyember 1930.1 Leonora describes how, when meeting Shoghi Effendi, she 'was awed, overwhelmed, by the spiritual majesty of his presence, his love, his purity'.2 She frequently visited the Hoiy Shrines to pour out her heart in prayer. 

 She had the immense privilege of meeting Baha'i KMnum the beloved sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha on several occasions. 'On the day set for my departure, the Greatest Holy Leaf was sitting near the door and I knelt down before her in tears, while she gently, Lovingly, stroked my head.'3 In saying goodbye,  Shoghi Effendi emphasized that 'of first importance is the direct teaching work, second in importance is the translation, and third social service, if you have time for it'.4 

 During the 1930s more traveling teachers visited South America and additional pioneer settlers gradually strengthened the work Leonora had begun. This was especially so after the launching of the first American Seven Year Plan in 1937 which aimed at the systematic spread of the Faith throughout Latin 

America.                   

 For Leonora these visits reached their culmination when her beloved May Maxwell traveled to South 

America in February 1940. They

 were able to spend some wonderful days together in Rio, and then Mrs. Maxwell went on to Argentina, with the intention of visiting Baha on her return trip. Leonora went home to Baha to prepare for this visit, only to be met upon her arrival with the tragic news of May Maxwell's passing in Buenos Aires. 

 She was able to attend the funeral and through this

  visit came in contact with the handful of Baha'is in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. 

 The following year, 1941, Leonora married an Englishman, Harold Armstrong, whom she had known for some time. He was destined to support and comfort her through the years ahead in her unceasing Baha'i services. During the next two decades Leonora and her husband lived in various places in Brazil and raised several adopted children. In 1946 she helped form the first 

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 of Rio itself. During the 1950s she spent much time at their farm outside Rio, and continued her important translation work. At this time she added Braille to her skills and undertook the transcription and distribution of Baha literature  in Portuguese 

Braille.                  

 In 1961 the first National Spiritual Assembly of Brazil was established. 

 Leonora could now rest assured that all the activities she had begun would be consolidated and perpetuated. One might have thought her work was drawing to a close, passed to the hands of the many capable younger believers. The crowning labors of Leonora's sixty years of international service, however, were still ahead. For it was in June of 1973 that the Universal House of Justice appointed her to membership on the Continental  Board of Counselors in South 

America. Characteristically

 overwhelmed, and apprehensive regarding her own inadequacies, she nevertheless flew off to her first meeting with that Board in Lima, Peru. From the outset it was clear that the spiritual influence of direct contact with her fellow-believers in the various lands she would visit was to be far-reaching. During those first memorable meetings in Lima, young and old literally sat at her feet imbibing the radiant love, the immense tenderness,  which flowed forth in waves of healing from her whole being. It was always a spiritual feast to be with her. She seemed to move in the shadow of her Guardian, and one always felt him close in her presence. 

 Among the joyful events of Leonora's latter years were the visits to Latin America made by the Hand of the Cause, Abdu'l-Baha Riihiyyih 

Kh6num, the Guardian's    

 widow, and the daughter of May and Sutherland Maxwell. 

 It was in her presence, in April 1971, at the time of the dedication of the Mother Temple of Latin America in Panama, that the homage mentioned earlier, was paid to Leonora. On the several occasions that Abdu'l-Baha visited Brazil, they spent as much time together as possible. Rhhiyyih KMnum recollects a little of their long association in the following words: 'When Leonora went to South America she was over twenty-five  years old and I was fifteen years younger. My first vivid recollection of her was when, on one of her return visits to America in the 1920s, she came to the hotel in New York where my mother and I were staying; she was tall and slender with brown hair, a sallow complexion and droopy brown eyes in which was an expression of sincerity, of purpose and purity of spirit. 

 Her personality seemed to have united the tenacity of Martha Root with an unsureness of herself which she constantly overcame through her complete consecration to serving the Faith. I must have seen her many times before this, because she and my mother had a profound bond of love and I loved her too. Mother always took a keen personal interest in people and was very generous; she disapproved of Leonora's wardrobe  and insisted that at her expense she go buy some summer frocks and other things. The oniy other intimate thing I remember about those hours we had together was her description of how she had been living — at least in the beginning — in the home of a family in a single room which had no doors or windows except one big door that opened onto the garden; she was greatly disturbed by two things, the huge cockroaches that crawled across the ceiling and sometimes fell on her in bed in the night, and the fact that she had an unwelcome admirer who would come into the garden and heave huge bouquets through the open door as a tribute to his wouldbe lady love. 

 When she closed the door, in that tropical heat, she suffocated! 

 'Shoghi Effendi considered Leonora as one of the Faith's outstanding and most distinguished  believers in the West, he never forgot the great historic significance of her arising to piomeer in Latin America before the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and in his letters to her he warmly praised her exemplary and ceaseless services, in which he took a keen interest. 

 'Our friendship, strong and deep in both our lives, was renewed and reinforced on the rare but prized occasions when we met during my visits to Latin America and spent as much


<p738>

  time together as my schedule permitted; the last time was at the meeting of the South American Counselors in Lima, Peru, at the end of the Green Light Expedition in 1975; always we would talk about my mother — our greatest mutual bond. 

 'The study of such a life as Leonora's, a life of complete consecration to Baha'u'llah and His teachings, a life of ceaseless work which lasted till a few hours before her passing at the age of eighty-five, a life in which it never even occurred to Leonora that she was sacrificing —  such a life is a manual for every generation of Baha to study and presents an enduring challenge to all those who would follow in her footsteps. 

 Seven years of service were left to Leonora after she was appointed a Counselor. Her back somewhat humped, bent by years and years of translation and typing, literally often day and night, her neck stiff and increasingly painful, the valiant and indomitable Leonora, far from relaxing her efforts, extended her activities and travels immensely. Her husband had already passed away and between her trips she was able to concentrate long hours on the translation work: Gradually, however, her health began to fail. 

 A serious illness finally confined her to bed, and during her last months she was moved to Baha — the city where she had labored so arduously to establish the Faith sixty years before, a city now boasting ten thousand believers. 

 Here the friends lovingly ministered to her last needs. Even in the final week of her life she rallied her strength for one last outpouring. 

 Propped up in her bed she wrote out a translation of the newly-arrived English version of Baha'u'llah's Long Healing Prayer and of the Fire Tablet —  a final legacy for her many spiritual children. 

 The longing for service came to her young. The vastness of Latin America was the arena of her sacrifice. There she poured forth her life, and having given up the world, she gained the Kingdom. At the end she was incarnate light. 

 Even before she slipped from her earthly vesture, the unearthly radiance of her inner being surrounded those attending her. On 17 October 1980 her precious spirit quietly took flight to its celestial 

Source.

  Dad will always be remembered for his devotion, for his indefatigable travelling in the service of the Blessed Beauty, for his love for all races, for his patience and gentleness, and for his love of music and violin-making. 

 He was born on 7 March 1900, the third of four children of Robert W. and Ida 

(Koch) Scherer, in New    

 Ulm, Minnesota, U.S.A. Mother will always be remembered for her kindness, her tireless devoted service to everyone, her consecrated promotion and protection  of the Cause of God and for her beautiful smile.

  Baha'i life, but for the history books let me state that she was born on 8 December 1907 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the fourth of twelve children of 

Herman and Elsie (Lyman)   
Bremer. She married Dad    
on 28 February 1925.       

 I was born on 22 September 1929, their only child. 

 We travelled and moved many times as my father was a salesman. From 1931 until 1936 we lived in China where Dad worked for the Texas Oil Company. 

 Mother enjoyed horseback riding and acting in the theatre at this time. 

 But always we gravitated back to Milwaukee where most of our family lived. Mrs. Florence Petersen, who was to become my mother-in-law, heard of the Baha'i Faith first. 

 Within six months she and her husband,  Charles, and their son Glenn and I, became Baha in Wauwatosa, 

Wisconsin, on 12 January   

 1949. Glenn and I were married in August of that year and moved to Madison where Glenn was finishing his last year at the University of Wisconsin. We came back to Wauwatosa to visit in November, and what a beautiful surprise — my parents had just become Baha'is and were present at the Feast. It was the happiest feeling being part of an entirely Baha'i family. 

 When the Ten Year Crusade  

 was launched in 1953, Mother and Dad volunteered to pioneer to Macao for which service they were named 

Knights of Baha'u'llah    

 Dad was appointed an Auxiliary Board member in 1954. 

 Sometimes Mother travelled with him and sometimes she held down the homefront in Macao where they helped raise a Local Spiritual 

Assembly. She and Dad      

 attended the Teaching Conference in Nikko, 

Japan, in September 1955   

 and both may be seen in the conference photograph, a copy of which hangs in the Mansion of Baha. 

     In 1958 Mother and Dad     

 returned to the United States and lived for a short time in Shorewood, Wisconsin. Then, in 1959, they pioneered again, this time to Portugal. 

 They lived in Lisbon for a short while and finally settled in Sintra (formerly Cintra) where they helped form a Local Spiritual Assembly. 

 They made teaching trips to Faro, Portim&o and Espina. 
Dad was elected to the     

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Portugal and had the privilege of voting for the members of the first Universal 

House of Justice. He       

 voted by mail as he was unable to afford to travel to the Holy Land. Dad was very sick in January 1963 and, with their work completed in Portugal, they attended the London Conference in April 1963 on their way home to Milwaukee. 

 Their longing to be of service resulted in their winging their way, in 1970, to Funchal, Madeira, where they served with 

Ed Bode.2 In March 1973    

 they went back to Macao, stopping in Haifa for pilgrimage. 

 Mother's poor health and the difficulty of finding accommodation they could afford in Macao forced their return to the United States in June 1973. Here they settled in Burlington, Wisconsin, a homefront goal city. 

 Mother suffered a cerebral haemorrhage on 1 October 1980. 

 The Hand of the Cause Dhikru'lUb KlThdem chanted prayers at her sickbed. 

 On 30 October she passed on and was buried in the 

Burlington Cemetery.       
On 10 October 1982 Dad     

 died of congestive heart failure and was buried next to Mother. I thank God for my beautiful and extraordinary parents who have shown forth pure and holy deeds. Al-Shoghi Effendi, Messages to the Baha'i World, p. 57.

     Harold became a Baha'i     
in October 1956. At the    

National Teaching Conference

 in Blackpool in January 1959 he and his family volunteered to pioneer to Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, the most northerly British goal town of the beloved Guardian's Ten Year Crusade. Harold, his wife and their two children, aged nine and eleven, spent the Easter holiday that year on a campsite on the outskirts of the town, waking up on the first morning to find the tent surrounded by snow. 

     Harold Shepherd            

  All doors seemed to be closed as neither accommodation nor employment could be found. They returned to Manchester but returned to Inverness in July intending to devote their summer holiday to attempting to get settled. Their faith was rewarded: within a week they had acquired a house that was to become a real Baha'i home for countless pioneers, travelling teachers and friends, and would later become the 'gateway to the islands', as most of the Baha'is who travelled to the Western Isles, Orkneys and Shetlands passed through Inverness. It was virtually impdssible for Harold, already in his fifties, to find work so he took on the task of running the home while his wife, Betty, worked full time as a teacher. 

 Thus began twenty-two years of continuous, active service to the Cause of 

Baha'u'llah.               

 When Harold was serving on the Scottish Teaching Committee a project was developed under which Baha'is of independent means spent three-month periods in Orkney. Harold purchased 

'Little Gorse Cottage'     

 to further that project and that house, too became a home for many pioneers and travelling teachers.


<p741>
IN MEMORIAM                741

  The fruit of their pioneering was the establishment of a strong Local Spiritual 

Assembly in Inverness.    
This accomplished, Betty  

 and Harold, in September 1972, pioneered to Uganda where Betty could bring her professional  knowledge and experience to the run-fling  of Claire Gung's kindergarten. Harold had already suffered a heart attack before leaving for Africa but this did not prevent him from fulfilling his pledge. He was soon appointed to the committee charged with the care of Baha'i properties which included two Baha'i schools and three teaching institutes in different districts, as well as the House of Worship and Hazfratu'1-Quds on Kikaaya Hill in Kampala. 

 He became the vital force, together with Stuart Rhodes from the United States, in renovating the House of Worship. On an occasion when thieves broke into Claire Gung's kindergarten1 Harold was wounded in his efforts to protect Miss Gung. Only a providential fall over a roll of carpet protected him from fatal injury, as the knife, or panga, had been aimed at his head. 

   In February 1976 Harold's 

 health deteriorated  and he returned to Inverness alone, as Betty could not at that time leave 'Auntie' Claire to cope unaided at the kindergarten. They had intended to meet again at the Nairobi Conference in October. This separation was possibly Harold's greatest sacrifice for he had always been part of a family team. He did not return to Africa. 

 In May of that year he had another heart attack which brought Betty back to Scotland. Later in 1976, when he recovered, they pioneered to the Orkn~y Islands, a post they had offered to fill in 1972 as a possible alternative to Uganda. Harold became the chairman of the Orkney Local Spiritual Assembly, an institution for whose establishment he had worked so hard in earlier years. Even as his health deteriorated Harold offered unwavering support to Betty in her service as a member of the Auxiliary Board for Propagation in Scotland. 

 Harold Shepherd's life was dedicated entirely to serving Baha'u'llah. 

 Though not young when he embraced the Cause, he learned by heart numerous Tablets and prayers; they were his spiritual food. He was the embodiment of worship and of service. 

 The harvest of 1 See p. 209. 

 his labours is evident in the development of the Faith throughout the north of Scotland ~rnd the Scottish Islands, and he had his own special part to play in service to the Faith in Uganda.

     SOLOMON KAHALOA           

 1932 — 1980 It is impossible to speak of Solomon Kahaloa —  known as 'Sol' to his many friends — without speaking of his family, for it was as a family that they served the Cause of Baha'u'llah. One of Sol's Sons was the first to accept the Faith through the teaching of various friends, including David Schreiber, the 

Knight of Baha'u'llah    

 for the Leeward Islands, but in a very short time the entire family had embraced it and begun to serve actively on their home island of Hawaii in the State of Hawaii. 

 The Kahaloa family, drawing strength from Sol, was instrumental in forming the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Puna, Hawaii. An oldfashioned house raising, in which Baha'is from all over the Island took part, provided the first Baha Center for the Puna community. It was situated, as is the present Center, on land donated by Sol. 

 He was wellknown  in Hawaii, and later on Guam, for his Hawaiian luaus, complete with kalua (or pit-roasted) pig and Hawaiian music. 

 One of these events was the scene of the declaration of twenty-six souls including some tourists

  from passing buses. Sol had arranged a hukilau (an outdoor feast at which a large fishing net attached to a iong rope is placed in and then pulled from the sea). As these visitors to Hawaii assisted in hauling in the rope they were themselves drawn into the ocean of the Most 

Great Remembrance.         

 In the early 1970s the Kahaloa family moved to South Jr{ilo on the Big Island where they rented a large house for the purpose of attracting and teaching youth about Hawaiian arts and crafts as well as introducing them to the Baha'i Faith. 

 They worked tirelessly before, during and after the 

1974 Baha'i International  

 Youth Conference, an event still warmly remembered there and around the world by Baha'is and non-Bah&fs alike. 

 Guam, a goal of the Hawaii Baha'i community,  has a sizable population of Hawaijans, and the Kahaloas have relatives there. Those facts, and the desire to serve as pioneers, brought Sol, his wife, Emily, and their two youngest children, Bonnie and Sam, to the tiny southern village of Inarajan in 1975. The family immediately plunged into Bah&' activities. 

 Sol continued the tradition of preparing one of his famous lucius with its blend of physical and 'spiritual' food. The family lived at first in an old wooden house near Lnaraj an Bay. 

 A few months after settling into their home it and all their possessions were swept away by typhoon Pamela. With the assistance of their son, Greg, helpful friends and the Red Cross, the Kahaloas were moved into a small apartment a few miles further south. 

 That apartment and two vacant ones became the site of a Baha'i winter school later that year, and a nearby private beach owned by Sol's employer was made available for a Baha youth camp-out, activities for which, as always, Sol and his family provided the food. 

 Later they mOved to Mangilao in the central part of Guam where their home again became a center for Baha'i activity and the sharing of Hawaiian-style hospitality. 

 In 1980, at the request of the National Teaching Committee of the Mariana Islands, Sol made a trip to the small neighboring island of Rota. Emily met him at the airport upon his return. On the way to their home their vehicle was struck by another car, injuring both Emily and SoT. A few days later, on 

1 December 1980, Sol       

 succumbed to his injuries and pneumonia. During his last days he talked animatedly of the Rota teaching trip, the great potential for teaching the Faith there, and his plans to move his family to that island to spread the Message of Baha'u'llah. Throughout his years as a Baha'i he gave openhandedly of his possessions, his kindliness,  patience and love, and finally his life itself for the love of his Lord. He lived and died with the promise of Baha'u'llah, We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whomsoever will arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the host of the Concourse on high and a company of Our favored angels.1 We, his coworkers who are left behind, joyfully trust that Sol has joined that favored company. The Universal House of Justice, in its cable of 4 December, gave voice to the thoughts of the Baha'is of Hawaii and Guam:

This institute was created in 1970 by the Hand of the Cause of God Rahmatu'llAh Muhdjir who had advised Mr. Marnichihr Tahm6sibiy~n, a young Persian pioneer in Thailand, to reestablish himself in Padang to manage the hostel. Mrs. Vahdat, who at that time lived in Java, was requested to settle in Padang in order to assist in developing the project. Her passion for the Faith of Baha'u'llah, her deep love of children and her experience in the Education Centre in Tihnin made her service in the hostel a blessing. Scores of the children of Mentawai and of other parts of Indonesia consider 'Ismat Vahdat as their mother.

    'ISMAT (ESMAT) VAHDAT

 1900 — 1980 Mrs. 'Ismat Vahdat, who was born and raised in frTh, was an example of devotion in her Baha'i life. Her faith radiated from her face. She was always cheerful, confident and a source of comfort to the friends. 

 When, in 1943 — 1944, the beloved Guardian called for Iranian pioneers, she volunteered to go to 'Lr6q, although she was a single woman, having been widowed at an early age. When the government of 'Jr~q required the pioneers to leave that country she went to Tihr6n to serve in the Education Centre, an institution that catered for Baha orphans and needy children. Under her management the children had a very happy home. 

 However, the Guardian's call for pioneers during the Ten Year Crusade again stirred her heart. She left Tihr~in in 1955 or 1956 and after a brief visit to India pioneered to Indonesia where she moved from place to place as the need arose in order to be of use to the Baha'i community. 

 From 1970 until her life ended on 9 December 1980 she served in the hostel for Baha'i 

       PEDRO VARGAS               

 1940 — 1980 Pedro Vargas, a Toba Indian, born on 7 August  1940 in Argentina, was among the first of his tribe to embrace the Baha'i Faith and is to date the most distinguished of its followers among his people to have passed to the worlds beyond. 

 The first efforts to enrol the Tobas of the Chaco province of Argentina were undertaken  immediately following the Continental Conference held in La Paz, Bolivia, in August 1970. In three successive projects more than one thousand people entered the Cause. The records of the first believers to accept the Faith in the locality of Makalle bear the name of Pedrp's father, Vicente Vargas, who was wellknown as a former tribal leader or cacique and as a pastor of a local evangelical church. Pedro was respected by his people as one of the 'learned'. Like his father, he had served as pastor of an Indian church and was well versed in Christian scriptures. 
He was also knowledge

       Pedro Vargas               

  able about the medicinal properties of the plants and herbs native to the Chaco and their application to various human ailments. 

 From the moment of his acceptance of the call of the New Day Pedro arose, first, to deepen his knowledge of the fundamental verities of the Baha'i Faith, and then to travel and share it with his Toba brethren. 

 Later, in response to the goals of the Nine Year Plan, he made the first translations of the Baha'i Sacred Writings into the Toba language. Though the written form of Toba is still in its early stages of development and few members of the tribe are familiar with its use, Pedro could both read and write his native tongue. His translations include a selection of prayers, selections from The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah, and 'Unity in Diversity', one of 'Abdu'l-Baha's discourses from Paris 

Talks.                     

 Among Pedro's accomplishments was his continual participation in teaching projects which were to raise the standard of Baha'u'llah throughout the Chaco area and bring His light to thousands of new souls. In 1972 he took part in the opening of the Miraflores reservation and continued until his death to nurture that community as a travelling teacher. In 1975 he joined the team that opened to the Faith the Bartholome de las Casas reservation in the province of Formosa. 

 In 1977, at the invitation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Paraguay, he assisted in the enrolment of the first Toba believers in the locality of Cerrito near Asunci6n. The following year, accompanied by Francisco G6mez, he made an historic fifteen-day journey on foot into an area of the Chaco now known as 'the impenetrable'  because of its thick thorn forests, wandering riverbeds, bothersome mosquitoes and poisonous snakes. Pedro and his companion  left Baha literature along the way with those in the Toba settlements and with the white criollos who offered them water and kindness during their tortuous and wearisome journey. 

 Pedro served for a number of years as chairman of the Regional Teaching Committee  and attended many Baha'i conferences including the International Music Festival held in Rosario del Tala, Entre Rios, Argentina,  in 1973 where he presented his Toba rendition  of the Spanish hymn El es el Rey de los Reyes. He is also the author of a rendering, in the musical style and language of his people, of a portion of the Tablet of Ahmad as well as chants of the Greatest Name in Arabic, Spanish and Toba. He loved singing devotional  music and possessed a rich musical voice, a recording of which is still in existence. He was a commanding speaker and often conducted study classes. I remember well an address that he gave in Makalle, his home town, on the subject 'The Kingdom of God on Earth' which he based on the eleven principles enunciated by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris Talks. I was deeply impressed by his grasp of the true significance of the Baha'i Revelation in relation to the establishment of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 Suffering was one of Pedro's constant companions  throughout his years as a Baha'i. Shortly after he accepted the Faith he lost his only infant daughter in an accident. Later on he suffered a paralysis of his lower extremities which he overcame after a long period of convalescence. 

 At times, because of the harsh conditions encountered while travelling to deliver the message, he would experience great pain; nevertheless, he would oniy comment  that whatever befell him was according to the wisdom of God. In the last year of his

IN MEMORIAM                745

  life Pedro and his family moved to the capital of Resistencia province where he hoped to find work that would allow him to travel regularly to surrounding areas on weekends. A local Centre had recently been constructed there and Pedro consented to live in it and extend hospitality to the Baha'i visitors who arrived from time to time. He also contributed to the completion of the building. He had just finished repairing the windows and was about to begin constructing a porch when he passed away on 15 December 1980. 

 The municipal employees who attended to the legal formalities  asked who was this man — apparently poor and bereft of worldly goods — that so many people should have come to attend his funeral, a Baha'i service. His fellow believers and Toba brethren wept tears of great sadness at the news of his passing. 

 One day when Pedro and I were discussing the difficulties some pioneers were having in adapting to their new post, Pedro remarked: 'A pioneer is like a tree which has been transplanted to a new spot in the garden. Before the tree can take root again it must first shed all its old leaves. Only then will the new sprouts be forthcoming. You who are pioneers must pass through the same process. These friends are only shedding their old leaves.' 

 Now that Pedro himself has shed his earthly form, may God grant that the tree of his eternal being be adorned with fragrant leaves and blossoms in the Kingdom of Abh6. 

 His Baha'i life was one of truly fruitful service and exemplary steadfastness in the early years of the Cause among the Toba people.

    MANCICHITIR HAKIM         

 1910 — 1981 Man6chihr llakfm, son of Dr. Arast6 Hakfm, was born in Tihr4n in 1910. 

 After receiving elementary and secondary education at the Tarbfyat School, he studied medicine in France for the next nine years on a government grant. He completed a course in general medicine and specialized in teaching anatomy. He and his wife, Germaine, were married in 1938; they had two children, Paul and Christine. 

     Marnichihr Hakim          

  He returned to ir6n, served his term of conscription, and for two years worked at the University of TihrTh where he established a 

Chair of Anatomy. He      

 returned to Paris where he took his degree at the Medical College and then won the agrc~gation for professorial rank in the Universities of France. Returning to IrAn, he taught in the University of Tihr~n for the next thirty years. He was renowned for his researches in anatomy, his discoveries being twice cited in Le Rouvi&, the standard work on the subject. 

 His writings have become part of the textbooks used in many medical colleges. 

 Tile was also wellknown as a specialist in gastroenterology. 

 In 1976 he was decorated by the French government with the Ltgion d'honneur for his humanitarian services. 

 At the time of his death, Professor Ijakfm had retired from the University of Tihr4n and had been associated for several years with the work of the medical school of the National University of Iran. 

 Professor Hakim was no less distinguished in his work for the Baha'i Faith. Over a long period he was a member of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of I ran, and several times its chairman; he was a member of various


<p746>
746                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  other Baha bodies, as well. He laboured long to extend and organize the facilities of the Baha'i hospital in Tihr~n and was for many years chairman of its Board of Directors. 

 At about 5.30 p.m. on 12 January 1981 some assaifants, posing as patients, gained admittance to Professor. Hakim's surgery and shot him dead. 

 The newspapers, aware for the most part that he was killed because he was a Baha'i, feared to report it. One lone exception  was the daily Mizdn of Tihr6n which mentioned it briefly in its issue of 17 January. The magazine Tib va Ddrzi, No. 62, 4 February 1981, carried an article by Dr. Shukru'116h Asadi mentioning Professor Hakim's achievements. 

 This assumes special import by virtue of the fact that the author was fully aware of the reason which brought about the assassination. 

 Shortly after his tragic death, Professor Hakim's residence and its contents were confiscated under a government order issued, significantly, several months prior to this event. 

 A befitting funeral was given him on 15 January, and at memorial meetings held on 19 and 20 January, warm and endearing tributes were paid to the nobility of his life, a fruitful and honourable life that had been devoted to study and research for the welfare and wellbeing of all people. There were many in all parts of the country who had such faith in his skill and healing power that they used to speed to him when ailing and return home hale and hearty. 

 More than four thousand Baha'is attended the funeral of Professor Hakim. An eyewitness described it as 'a truly great event This remarkable gathering had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Baha'is as a demonstration of love, unity and the readiness for sacrifice by the beleaguered and oppressed Baha'i community in the Cradle of the Faith.' 

 Moving tribute was paid Professor Hakim by his daughter, Christine Samandaif-Hakim, in her book Les Baha'is ou victoire sur lii violence 

(Lausanne: Editions Pierre 

 Marcel Favre), written shortly after his death. 

 Upon its publication the Universal House of Justice, on 25 March 1982, cabled the National Spiritual Assembly of Switzerland requesting that it relay LOVING CONGRATULATIONS to the author on the publication of her VALUABLE BOOK

       SUBHI ELL&S                

 1902 — 1981 The passing of Subhi Eli6s on 26 January 1981 in Alexandria, Egypt, after a five-day illness, has ended a period of sixty years of devoted, loving and fruitful service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

     Born to Coptic Christian   

 parents on 17 May 1902 in an obscure village in the heart of the Nile delta, his childhood was marked by extreme hardship. With the premature death of his young father in 1906, the four-year-old Subl2i was left to the care of an ageing, rich and kind yet helpless grandfather. 

 His widowed young mother, who was then pregnant with her second son, Sabri, was forced to leave her house and return to that of her parents in a nearby village, due to the machinations and unbearable treatment of one of her deceased husband's brothers. Subhi, who was not al-Towed  to move with his mother, received his oniy tuition at the reading class conducted by the village priest. 

 Bible reading was the only subject taught in these classes held in the village church, with the priest expounding the narrow and literal interpretations which he himself had accepted through a similar education. 

 Subhi, however, had a flexible mentality and was able to investigate truth for himself independently of the traditional process. 

 He recognized the limitation and prejudice of his tutor and observed the fanatical behaviour of high-ranking clergy on their visits to his village. At an early age he displayed courage in rebuking and criticizing them publicly. 

 In 1911 Subhf was surprised and overwhelmed  with joy to discover that he had a brother, when Sabri was mature enough to be claimed from his mother by the family of his father. The reunited brothers formed a deep attachment which led them u1timat~1y to material success and which was heightened by the spiritual bond that the Faith of Baha'u'llah

IN MEMORIAM                747

       Subbi Elids                

  provided. Soon after being brought together the young men, again through the plotting of their cruel paternal uncle, were denied any share in the inheritance of their grandfather, were dismissed from their home and driven from their village. Homeless and wretched, the two boys made their own way unaided. They were then attracted to the Baha'i Faith through the kindness and love of another uncle, the late Ibr6him ¶Abdu'1-Masfh, whose sterling character and lofty idealism stood in marked contrast to all they had witnessed. Subhi embraced the Faith in March 1921 and proceeded to attract Sabrf's interest simply by requesting him to carry some Baha'i books to friends with the purposed order that he was not to read them. 

 It was not long until Sabri asked his brother how to declare himself a Baha, apologizing for disobeying the instruction that he was not to read the books he had delivered on Subhf's behalf. Subbi's zeal was such that he immediately made it known to his relatives that he was a member of the Baha Faith, ably meeting the opposition they cast up. 

 A few years later the brothers settled in Alexandria where Subhi remained virtually for the rest of his life. 

 In 1934 Sabri began his service as a pioneer, going first to Ethiopia, and later to a post further afield where he continues his work to this day. 

 In the early months of his life as a Baha'i, Subhf yearned to make pilgrimage to the Holy Land and attain the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, but alas his heart's desire was shattered by the passing of the beloved Master. A few years Later he corresponded with Shoghi Effendi and received many inspiring replies. He had the privilege of making two pilgrimages and on each occasion had the bounty of meeting the Guardian. He lovingly cherished these experiences and in the eve of his life would speak tearfully of them to the young Baha'is. 

 Subbi was elected to the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Alexandria, formed in 1924, and served on that body until the disbandment of the Baha'i administrative institutions in Egypt in 1961. He also served as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of 

North East Africa. Characteristic

 of the early days of the Baha'i administration in Egypt were the efforts of the believers to grasp the purpose of the New World Order and to witness its divine institutions come into existence. 

 Under the unerring guidance of the beloved Guardian they longed to exercise their sacred responsibilities. 

 They made devoted efforts to achieve recognition of the Faith as an independent religion and to secure the right for Baha'is to follow their teachings in matters of personal status. They were inspired and encouraged in taking this course by the historic verdict of the High Muslim Court in 1924 which ruled that the Baha'i Faith is totally independent from Islam. 

 Subhi's own contribution in those days was considerable. 

 On the death of an infant son in September 1945 he refused to have the child buried in the Coptic or Muslim cemeteries and requested that the authorities allocate a burial ground to the 

Baha of Alexandria.      

 Although his request was not granted, from that time onward Baha'is were permitted to inter their dead in 'civil' cemeteries which had previously been restricted  to non-Egyptian libre penseurs. He raised his six surviving children as devoted and active Baha'is, three of whom followed the example of their uncle Sabri in marrying


<p748>
748                 TIlE I3AHA I WORLD

  Baha'is of Muslim background despite the wrath of fanatical non-Bah6'f relatives. 

 These marriages added lustre to the Baha'i community  as living examples of the capacity of the teachings of Baha'u'llah to unite people of different backgrounds. 

 In 1977, despite failing health, he taped a five-hour recording giving a comprehensive historical account of the development of the Baha'i Faith in Egypt and, in particular, Alexandria. 

 Quite often, when the Faith was attacked in Egyptian publications, the writers received a spirited reply from Subhi, either published in the same manner, or in the form of a personal letter. 

 His greatest share of service to the Faith took place during the tumultuous, though blessed, decade that followed  the proscription of Baha activities in Egypt in 1961. The Baha'is were subjected to a series of arrests, trials and sentences of imprisonment, notably in 1965, 1967 and 1972, and Subhf played his full part in these events. 

 In prison he conducted himself in a manner that inspired his Baha'i fellow captives and filled his awestricken captors with perplexity.  On two occasions he simply presented himself at police headquarters before the authorities had an opportunity to arrest him at home. ReIea~ed from prison on bail pending his trial, he would painstakingly compile materials for the use of the non-B aM'i lawyers who were to defend the Baha'is. 

 He passed on to the Abh6 Kingdom without having lived to witness the fulfilment of his heart's desire, the restoration of freedom and recognition to the Baha community of Egypt, which even today is still withheld. His.friends there find solace only in remembrance of his great service which was worthy of emulation. 'His passing', his brother wrote to other members of his family, 'has scalded my heart He was made homeless in early boyhood, yet he spread a shelter of loving protection over me. To me he was a father and a mother •Embracing the Faith in his early youth, he remained faithful and stalwart Over a period of sixty years the torch of his faith kept burning... 

 My only refuge is to turn my face towards the 

Supreme Ruler, that He    

 may bestow on him the best of rewards.'

 1892 — 1981 'How proud I feel of the spirit that so powerfully animates you. My prayers will, I assure you, accompany you on your great and historic adventure. Persevere no matter how great the obs.tacles in your way. 

 Future generations will glorify your deed and emulate  your example.' 

 No words other than these, written to Honor Kempton on 12 March 1939 by the beloved Guardian, could more adequately pay tribute to the life of this indefatigable servant of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, the spiritual mother of both Alaska and of Luxembourg. 

         Born on 30 September 1892 

 in Maidenhead, England (four months after the passing of Baha'u'llah), she was raised by her mother in the spirit of the Anglican Church. 

During World War I Honor  

 served as a Red Cross volunteer, and became engaged to an American  surgeon whom she followed to the United States after the war. She stayed in the Chicago area and, after the death of her fianc6 in a car accident, moved to Wilmette to live with an English family. 

 Here she first heard of the Baha'i Faith and became attracted to its teachings. 

 In 1935 she moved to San Francisco, attended firesides in the home of Leroy and Sylvia loas and soon after declared her belief in Baha'u'llah. 
She was elected to the    

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 and immediately engaged in teaching. 

 When the Guardian cabled the American Baha'i community on 26 January 1939 calling for NINE HOLY SOULS tO open the remaining virgin territories of North America,1 Honor 1 See Shoghi Effendi, Messages to America, p. 16. The unsettled territories were Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, 

Manitoba and Nova Scotia.


<p749>
IN MEMORIAM                749

      Honor Kempton             

  immediately responded by volunteering to go to Alaska, a place which at that time some might have deemed not a suitable locality for an unattached woman in her late forties to make her home. In her biographical notes Honor writes, 'I was, however, quite sure that Alaska was the place for me. 

 I felt that the Guardian was speaking to me when he sent that message.' 

 And so Honor set out upon her spiritual odyssey which was to extend throughout six successive international teaching plans given to the Baha'i world by Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and which was to encompass Alaska and the European continent. 

 Her decision to go to Alaska had come as the result of a mystical experience of great intensity. 
Anchorage was her chosen goal.

 Although well-meaning friends diverted her attention to Juneau she was led, again by what she felt to be divine promptings, to settle in Anchorage. 

 On 18 April 1939 she disembarked at Juneau. She did not find employment there but assisted a newfound friend who operated a bookshop. Two months later she moved to Anchorage and established the town's first bookstore. 

 'The Book Cache', as she called her shop, was later described by a former Governor of the State as 'the cultural center of Alaska'. After four discouraging months, during which those she contacted appeared to show no real interest in the Baha'i 

Faith, Janet Whiteneck    

 (later Stout), a seeker, enrolled — the first person in Alaska to do so during the first 

Seven Year Plan. Soon     

 other pioneers arrived, new believers were accepted into the community, and in September 1943 the first 

Local Spiritual Assembly  
was formed. During World  

War II Honor became an American

 citizen and continued to find new ways to spread the news of the coming of Baha'u'llah. In exchange for book reviews that she prepared for a radio station she was given an opportunity to present weekly radio broadcasts on the Faith. In 1944 she attended the National 

Convention in Wilmette    
as Alaska's first delegate.

 In 1946 Honor, who was then in her mid-fifties, proposed settling in 

Europe. Shoghi Effendi    

 approved the suggestion provided her departure from Alaska would not in any way affect the stability of the Cause there. After an extensive teaching trip in England, undertaken  with the encouragement of the Guardian, and a visit to her family, she arrived in February 1947 in Luxembourg, the smallest of the ten goal countries still unopened to the Faith in the second Seven Year Plan. Soon joined by other pioneers, she witnessed the declaration of faith of the first Luxembourg believer in 

December 1947. Until      

 her departure,  shortly before the formation of the first Local Spiritual 

Assembly in Luxembourg, Honor

 remained the focal centre of the many teaching and deepening activities initiated by the small group of believers there. 

 In January 1949 she moved to Geneva, Switzerland, to serve as the representative of the European Teaching Committee at the International Baha'i Bureau. In her new function she helped to organize the annual European Teaching Conferences, including the International Teaching Conference held in Stockholm in 1953 which launched the Ten Year Crusade in that continent. 

 She maintained  a constant correspondence with the World Centre, and with pioneers, new believers and young 

Local Spiritual Assemblies
through


<p750>
750

                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  out Europe, and received many travelling teachers and other visitors, amongst whom were almost all the Hands of the Cause. She also served as a member of the Italo-Swiss Regional 

National Spiritual Assembly.
     When the International    

 Bureau was closed in 1957, Honor opened to the Faith several goal cities in 

France, including LuTe    

 and Nancy. After a visit to England, where her mother declared her belief in Baha'u'llah at age ninety-nine, the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States asked Honor if she would be willing to devote the remainder of her life to pioneering, no matter where. Readily consenting, she was asked to return to Luxembourg. Thus, in 1959, in her sixty-sixth year, she began to add the final laurels to a life already crowned by achievements. 

 She opened to the Faith the industrial south and the agricultural north of Luxembourg, leaving behind her flourishing communities in Esch-sur-Aizette  and Etteibrueck. During this time she served on the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Benelux countries. 

 In 1963, as a delegate from Luxembourg, she attended the International 

Baha Convention in Haifa 

 for the election of the first Universal House of Justice. 

 She moved to Kopstal-Bridel in 1973 and lived with Miss Suzette Jr{ipp, the first Luxembourg believer, a move which enabled the last Local Spiritual Assembly of the Nine Year Plan in that country to be formed. 

 In addition to serving on the Local Spiritual Assembly she continued to teach, to pray for new souls to discover the Cause •of Baha'u'llah, to deepen and encourage her fellow believers, to correspond with old and new friends in Alaska and Europe, to make plans to open yet other localities in Luxembourg, and to serve on national committees. 

 In 1976 she made a short visit to Alaska where she attended the International  Conference in Anchorage and made a trip to Barrow, the Eskimo community dear to her heart. 

 Although physically weakened through advanced  age and failing health she remained spiritually active until her last breath, thus dying in 'battle dress' as she had always wished to do. At her passing on 24 February 1981 the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Luxembourg,  deploring the loss of this 'dearly beloved, much admired' believer, reported that 'until her last moment she was eager to hear of the progress of her beloved Faith and to give her part to its development Her unfailing fervour, her complete dedication and steadfast service', the National Assembly averred, 'will remain a shining example to all believers. 

   On 27 February the Universal

 House of Justice sent the following cable to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 

States:

His father, Muhammad-Husayn

 Ulfat (known as 'Att~r), had been a prominent Shaykhi of Yazd prior to his conversion to the Baha'i Faith, and when the populace of that town rose up against the Baha'is in 1903, in one of the most savage attacks that the Ba1A'fs of fran have experienced, he was among the prime targets of the mob. Mr. Labfb's father was expelled from Yazd and his shop and home were ransacked and demolished in the early days of the upheaval, while his mother was set upon by a throng, beaten to the point of death, and then thrown into a dark, damp dungeon for three days. Mr. Labib himself, then aged nine, spent several days in the underground canals that bring water to Yazd, seated on the shoulders 

      Muhammad Labib             

 of his elder brother, until they found refuge in the cellar of the house of one of the Baha'is. Unable to remain in Yazd, the family moved in 1905 to 

Tihrhn where Mr. Labfb     
attended the Baha'i Tarbiyat

School.                    

 From 1914 Mr. Labfb took a strong interest in Esperanto, and the following year when he moved to Qazvfn to teach at the Baha'i Tavakkul School he initiated Esperanto lessons and became the official representative  of the World Esperanto movement. 

 In 1916, while he was in Qazvin, he bad the idea of establishing a trust fund called the Nawna-hAlhn  Company in which the Baha'i children who attended his school could save their money. In 1919 Mr. Labib and his father were on pilgrimage in Haifa for sixty days. 

 During this time Mr. Labib presented his idea of the NawnahhlAn to 'Abdu'l-Baha Who gave His blessing and endorsement to these plans and even contributed two gold coins as His 'share' in the company. 

 Mr. Labfb was a keen photographer and often in the course of teaching trips and on other occasions he took many photographs of great historical importance for the Baha Faith. He accompanied Effie Baker' in 1930 —  1931 when, at the request of Shoghi Effendi, she toured Iran taking photographs for his translation of The Dawn-Breakers. Mr. Labib crowned a life of service to the Faith of Baha'u'llah by pioneering in 1955 to Hiroshima,  Japan, and to other parts of the Far East where he remained for nine years, and in 1963 to Rhodes in the Mediterranean. 

 Towards the end of his life he wrote his memoirs as well as a large number of works dealing with episodes in Baha'i history. 

 These are rendered all the more valuable because they are profusely illustrated with his photographs. 

 One of his books, The Seven Martyrs of Hurmazak, has been translated into English and published;2 the rest remain for the future. Although blind and physically infirm in the last years of his life, he retained an active mind until his passing on 14 March 1981. 

 The announcement of his death elicited the following cable from the Universal House of Justice, dated 

23 March:

Ridvaniyyih (Ouskouli)    

 Suleimani was born to Baha'i parents on. 25 April 1904 in 'Ishqabad, Russia, the first of four daughters and a son born to Zahra and Husayn Ouskouli. 

 Both her parents were from I ffin, and the devotion and enthusiasm with which they served the Baha'i Faith was to ignite in Ridvaniyyih's heart a flame that never lessened and that was to warm all with whom she came in contact. When Ridvaniyyih was fifteen her mother passed away Leaving her to help care for her siblings with a joy and generous giving of self that was for six decades to characterize the hospitality she lavished upon all who entered her home. At eighteen she married Suleiman 'All 

Mu4ammad Suleimani Milani 

 in 'Ishqabad where they remained for a year. 

 In 1923 Mr. Ouskouli and Mr. and Mrs. Suleimani made their great journey to the East to pioneer in China, a land which 'Abdu'l-Baha longed to visit. They settled in Shanghai and were soon blessed with a visit from Martha Root who was making the first of her four trips to China. 

 During their many years in mainland China Mr. Ouskouli and Mr. and Mrs. Suleimani made every effort to teach the Faith to the Chinese people, a race whom the Master described as 'most simplehearted and truth-seeking'. Through all the wars and conflicts that raged about them, these lovers of the Blessed 

Perfection shared His     

 healing, peace-bringing Message with everyone they met. In August 1950 Mr. and Mrs. Suleimani reluctantly left Shanghai because of disturbed conditions. 

 Her father, although isolated and in his late seventies, decided to remain behind, to continue holding aloft the Light in the darkness around him. In various letters written on behalf of the Guardian,  or in postscripts in his own hand, Shoghi Effendi made it clear how deeply he appreciated  Mr. Ouskouli's remaining in Shanghai, an act to which he attached 'the greatest importance'. 

   In 1952 the Suleimanis    

 made their pilgrimage and had the inestimable privilege of being in the Guardian's presence. Shoghi Effendi showered them with loving kindness, mentioned their services in China and expressed his hope that, if possible, they would be able to return there. He assured them that that vast land would witness  the raising of the Banner of Baha'u'llah. After that never-to-be-forgotten sojourn, they returned to IrAn and on 30 August 1954 they set sail from IrAn for Taiwan, where they disembarked  at the port of Keelung on 22 October  and joyously cabled Shoghi Effendi news of their arrival. 

The beloved Guardian      

 cabled back, assuring them of his loving prayers. They were the first pioneers to settle in Taiwan. They made their home in Tainan, on the western coast of the island, facing mainland China. When they first arrived there were oniy ten Chinese believers. 

 On the eve of their first Naw-Riiz in Taiwan four friends became Baha'is, the first of many who were led to the Faith through the humble and persistent efforts of Ridvaniyyih and her husband. At Ridvan 1955 the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land wrote that 'The wonderful news of the progress of the Cause in Formosa brought great joy to his [the Guardian's] heart'. 

 By Ridvan 1956, through their untiring efforts, the Suleimanis were able to wftness the formation, in Tainan, of the first 

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 of Taiwan. Through his secretary the Guardian expressed his pleasure at this victory, remarking on its historic importance, and stating that 'it is the first of the universal institutions of the Faith to be established in that unique and promising

  country. It is the center of the spiritual gifts which must now come to the people of the area.' In November 1956 the Sffleimanis hosted the first All-Taiwan Teaching Conference  in their home which was attended by the Hand of the Cause of God Agnes Alexander  and forty other Baha'is. This had been preceded just a couple of months before by Taiwan's first summer school, also held in Tainan. 

   In 1958 the Suleimanis    

 purchased land and constructed a beautiful Baha'i Center in Tainan — Taiwan's first — located in an attractive  area near an important national urnversity. In October the following year, during the third Taiwan summer school, the Center was dedicated. 

 Later, through their loving efforts, the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tainan was incorporated, and Ridvaniyyih and her husband  then legally transferred the ownership to the Local Assembly as a donation. It was the first property belonging to the Faith in Taiwan, and the Suleimanis humbly offered to be its caretakers. 

 In the years that followed, the Center, with the Suleimanis as gracious hosts, was blessed with the visits of many of the Hands of the Cause, Baha'i traveling teachers and oth&r friends from around the world. No guest of Mrs. Suleimani's can ever forget her warm embrace, her enthusiastic greeting, her hurried footsteps as she brought a continuous flow of delicious homemade refreshments, the sumptuous meals that she seemed to create in no time at all. She would always inquire, with what one knew to be genuine concern, about one's health, about one's family and about the progress of the Faith in one's home area, the good news of which always brought her much joy. 

 It was always a pleasure to talk with her, for she was quick-witted, fdl of humor and forbearing. 

 Even into her seventies she would always try to journey to meet new1y-arriv~td pioneers, bringing for them a homemade cake and plants from her garden. It was only in the last couple of years of her life that a debilitating skin disorder which doctors could neither diagnose nor cure forced Mrs. Suleimani to stop her constant travels around Taiwan, journeys she made as a member of the Auxiliary Board or as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly. In addition to serving on the Local 

Spiritual Assembly of Tainan

 from the time of its formation in 1956 until her passing nearly a quarter of a century later, Mrs. Suleimani also served as a member of Taiwan's 

National Spirituffi Assembly

 from its formation in 1967 through 1970, and again from 1973 through 1977. In 1978 she attended the 

International Convention  
for the election of the   

Universal House of Justice

 and had the bounty of being selected as one of the tellers; in her diary she commented that the wonderful task took all night. 

 As her illness grew worse Mrs. Suleimani suffered great pain, but would never let one know of it. After serving others for so many years it was a true sacrifice for her to allow others to try to serve her. At last, in the early morning hours of 18 March 1981, she left behind her small, bent, frail body. She was buried on the eve of Nawruz on the crest of a hill overlooking a lake in Tainan county. 

 Her resting-place is the first Baha'i cemetery of Taiwan. She faces West towards the Qiblib. Between her grave and the Holy Land stretches the vast expanse of China, her adopted home, the pioneering post where two generations of her family have achieved their desire of burying their bones. We know that for generations to come the memory of Husayn Ouskouli and

  of his daughter, Ridvaniyyih Suleimani, will be honored, as the Chinese people reflect on the lives of these valiant souls who brought to their land the Light of Baha'u'llah, in obedient response to the Master's call: China, China, China-ward the 

Cause of Baha'u'llah       

 must march. Where is that holy, sanctified Baha'i to become the teacher of China! He must entertain no thought of his own but ever think of their spiritual welfare. In China one can teach many souls and train and educate such divine personages that each one of them may become the bright candle of the world of humanity. 

 Had I been feeling well I would have taken a journey to China myself China is the country of the future. I hope the right kind of teacher will be inspired to go to that vast empire to lay the foundation of the Kingdom of God, to promote the principles of divine civilization, to unfurl the banner of the Cause of Baha'u'llah and to invite the people to the banquet of the

  'Papa Appa', as he was affectionately called by Baha friends, young and old, both in his native Mauritius and in some African countries, was the fifth child in a family of six children. The family was of modest means and his Star of the West, vol. 13, no. 7, October 1922, pp. 184 — 186. 

Seewoosumbur Jeehoba Appa  

  education did not extend beyond the primary classes. 

 His father died at an eady age, so part of the responsibility for the household soon fell upon his youthful shoulders. 

 He started a teaching career as a fourth class teacher in the same school he had attended as a child, not suspecting that later in life he would be called by Baha'u'llah to be a teacher of His Message. Many of his former students who attended his funeral still remembered their former teacher, Mr. Appa, describing him as the man with the smiling face whom everybody loved. 

 He was really a very kind and lovable teacher and a good man; I was myself a pupil in the school in which he taught and, though not in his class, I remember how my classmates and I wished to have him as our teacher. 

 Mr. Appa's first contact with the Baha'i Faith was in 1956. He was a pure-hearted man and it was not difficult for the light of the Revelation of God to reflect in his heart once it reached there. He immediately began a life of service. 

 His home soon became the centre of many activities and he was happy oniy


<p755>
IN MEMO1ZIAM              755

  when he was able to make teaching trips almost every day. He came from an orthodox Hindu background and his family and friends did not approve of his accepting the Baha Faith and engaging in service to it. Despite the racial hnd religious prejudices he encountered, his faith was strong enough to withstand the opposition and pressures exerted by his relatives  and friends. Eventually they grew to respect him and the Faith he had espoused. He served unwaveringly and faithfully until his last breath, dying as he would have wished 'with his boots on'. The day on which Mr. Appa winged his flight to the Abh6 Kingdom was the day he had chosen to host a dinner and devotional gathering in his home. 

 Although he had not felt well in the morning he would not cancel the meeting. 

 During the prayers he suffered an acute pain in his chest and was immediately taken to a nearby hospital where he quietly passed away within a few hours. 

 The news of his death on 28 March 1981 was a great shock to hi~ many friends who had never once heard him complain. 

 The Baha throughout the islands of the Indian Ocean, in Africa and beyond lost a kind, gentle and loving father, for the love that flowed from his heart for everybody was that of a caring parent. His life was an example of real Baha'i life. He was hardworking, conscientious and orderly, and always ready to accompany a Baha'i friend anywhere for the 

Cause of Baha'u'llah. He    

 not only read a great deal but frequently jotted down important extracts for others to profit by. 

 His home was a true centre of attraction: his obvious joy in greeting friends at his door and his 'Oh!' 

 of welcome would go straight to the heart. He was a child with the children, a young man with the youth, and an adult with his peers; but all who came in contact with him fell a warm, ~genuine fatherly affection. His name 'Appa' had the same sweetness as 'Papa' to me, and surely to many others who knew him closely. 

 It was the Hand of the Cause John Robarts who first called him 'Papa Appa' years ago at a meeting in Vacoas, and use of the appellation was adopted by many of the friends. DEEPEST SYMPATHY FAMILy YOUR GREAT LOSS, Mr. Robarts and his wife, Audrey, cabled, UNFORGETTABLE 

MEMORIES DEAR PAPA AI'PA   
I-US LONG SERVICE..        

  Papa Appa's service in the Faith of God was long indeed. Tile served on the first Local Spiritual Assembly of his home community of Vacoas. 

When the National Spiritual

 Assembly of the Indian Ocean came into being in 1964 he served as its treasurer. Later that year he was appointed a member of the Auxiliary Board for the Indian Ocean region and in 1968 was appointed a member of the first Continental 

Board of Counsellors       

 for the zone of Southern Africa. Over the years, even when his health-was was failing, he travelled for the Faith to many African countries and islands of the Indian Ocean and traversed on foot rough, hilly roads and paths. 

 His last journey outside Mauritius was in 1981 when he accompanied Counsellor Shfd6n Fath-i-A4am  to Madagascar. Mr. Appa rejoiced when he found that the Baha'i friends grasped the importance of love and unity as essential prerequisites for true and productive service to the Faith, and he constantly strove to help the friends achieve this understanding. In whatever function he was called to serve he did so with modesty, zeal, enthusiasm and thoroughness. His sole concern to the very last was to see the Faith progressing and the friends living in accordance with its laws and teachings. 

 Unquestioning obedience — to the Revealed Word and to the instructions of the beloved Guardian and the Universal House of Justice — was the hallmark of his life and the message he always tried to convey in the important functions he was called to perform. His firmness in the Covenant, as exemplified by his ceaseless service to the Cause and his strong love for his fellow believers, is a source of inspiration to all. 

 The Counsellors who had known and worked with him cabled on 31

The concluding sentence of that letter expresses beautifully the conviction shared by all who knew 'Papa Appa': 'As we pray for the progress of his soul, we in turn are confident of his assistance in our efforts to spread the Teachings of the Faith he so dearly loved.'

  Many members of the Irish Baha'i community knew Frances as that 'phenomenal worker' who used to burn the midnight oil for the Faith in the struggling community of Dublin. She became a Baha'i in 1960, entering a diminutive community in Dublin; there were only one or two believers in the whole of the rest of the Republic in those days. 

 The obstacles to Frances's entry into the Faith were tremendous. She was at that time separated from her husband, from whom she was later divorced, and was endeavouring to raise two young daughters alone; and her family background, like that of the Hand of the Cause George Townshend, was deeply rooted in the Church of Ireland. Any departure from her traditional religious and social background was bound to weaken support for her from these established, valuable sources during a most difficult period. 

 Yet she braved this, and more, for when the call was raised for overseas pioneers in 1964 she responded and set off with her young family to assist with the teaching work in Africa. 

     The National Spiritual     
Assembly of Uganda         

 was formed in the very year she arrived in the country. 

 The importance of her contribution to the teaching and administrative work there can never be overestimated and the radiant cheerfulness with which she performed her service will stand as an inspiration to all aspiring overseas pioneers. The time Frances spent in Uganda made a deep impression upon her as became obvious when she returned to Ireland in 1972. Clearly her experience with the African friends had deepened her own intrinsic qualities of patience, humility, love for every individual in the community and respect for the opinion of each member. She felt that we in Ireland had much to learn from the example of the young community of Uganda and never tired of presenting appropriate  examples always, prefaced with the remark which we came to anticipate with delight, 'Well, in Uganda we always used With the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Ireland in 1972, once again Frances's excellent secretarial and executive skills were brought into play. 
She was a


<p757>
IN MEMORIAM                757

  founding member of the 

National Book and Sales    

 Committee and was subsequently appointed  to the National 

Teaching Committee. She    

 took her responsibilities most seriously and rendered extremely valuable work to the community, particularly through the latter committee. 

 She also played a major role in the production of the news organ which came in time to be named New Day. Such service, however, tacked the challenge that Frances's spirit sought; increasingly she longed to return to Africa~ the continent to which she had developed a considerable attachment. 

 In 1974 she settled in Malawi. Her friends in Ireland looked forward to her cheerful, newsladen letters describing the progress of the Cause there. Invariably her letters contained anecdotes  relating to her life in her new home, and the lives of others of the pioneers. Her service in Malawi was suddenly cut short. She was overtaken by a serious illness which necessitated her return to London and eventually, in 1977, to her home in Ireland. 

 The year after her return she was elected to the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the Republic of Ireland. In addition to the normal work of the National Assembly she provided invaluable assistance in the secretariat and in relation to the administration of property. To the local community  of Dublin she was a valuable and dedicated worker, serving during the last years of her life as an eager and efficient Local Spiritual 

Assembly secretary. Frances

 Beard died 'in harness' as a member of the National Assembly. 

 One of my clearest memories of her at this time is of her presence at a meeting of the Assembly some months before her death, smiling, sharing jokes, enquiring about the teaching work and our own personal circumstances — always positive, always keen, mortally ill though she certainly was. 

 Frances was a warm and sympathetic friend and we are the poorer for her passing. She always asked with genuine interest after one's health, hmily, and activities, and was always sincere. She was a true friend and true servant. She came into the Faith of Baha'u'llah as a mature adult and gave the remaining half of her adult life to its service. Her unique life, embracing as it does service in two African countries and membership on the infant Irish National Assembly, is an indelible example for those who seek to~ play a part in the fulfilment of the high destiny won by our forebears in the Baha'i community of the British Isles during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi.

     MARGARET ROWLING           

 1897 — 1981 Margaret Rowling, a devoted handmaiden of Baha'u'llah whose service to the Faith extended  over more than forty years, was one of three who joined the Faith in Sydney, Australia,  in 1938 when there were only fifteen members in the community. Margaret held a job in the Public 

Service of New South       

 Wales which for some years kept her in Sydney where she took an active part in local Baha'i affairs. 
     In 1953 she attended the   

Intercontinental Conference

 in India and there determined to respond to the call for pioneers to the Pacific areas. 

 After returning to Australia she worked enthusiastically on the committee concerned with obtaining information about the islands of the Pacific and when she retired from her employment in 1954 at the age of fifty-five she left for Noumea as a pioneer. 

 A detailed listing of Margaret's itinerary over the years of her faithful and loving service in the Pacific area would require extensive research. 

 In the period between 1956 and 1975 she was almost constantly in motion, her travels taking her to Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti, 

New Caledonia, Noumea      
and the Cook Islands.      

 In 1957 she was appointed a member of the Auxiliary Board for Protection and in 1963 was elected to the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the South 

Pacific.                   

 It was on her return to Australia from the 1953 conference in India that Margaret began her study of the French language as a preparation  for her pioneering work in the Pacific. Her long service in the French-speaking islands was invaluable; she made many friends and was highly thought of. For several years, while serving as secretary of the New Caledonian Assembly, she was the oniy member who could speak both English and French. One ever-recurring problem during her time in the Pacific was the need to move constantly

  because a visa for a French area was granted for six months only. 

 In 1967, after attending the convention in Noumea, she came to Sydney in October for the Intercontinental Conference. In 1971 she visited Suva and other Fijian Baha'i communities, attending the Oceanic Conference in May of that year. In the 1970s Margaret spent much of her time in Sydney, for her health was failing and she had to undergo operations on her eyes; however, she visited Fiji again in September 1974 and 

March 1975.                

 Following her retirement Margaret was free to give her full attention and time to the service of Baha'u'llah and for nearly twenty years she travelled as a Baha'i teacher. 

 Her work was concentrated mainly in Fiji, New Caledonia and the New Hebrides. 

 In terms of Pacific Island travel she was unrivalled. 

 She was eloquent, direct in her manner, persevering and selfeffacing. Her mode of life, involving constant travel, was frugal and there was great simplicity in the requirements of her daily life. Her unassuming attitude towards life, combined with her other qualities, gave her a dignity which attracted many seeking souls to the Faith. 

 During her years of failing health in Sydney Margaret often spoke of her wish to return to her beloved island friends. Shortly before her passing on 

28 April 1981 the Sydney   

 friends received a telephone enquiry from Noumea: a New Caledonian believer was anxiously enquiring about the wellbeing of his Baha teacher, Margaret, whom he wished to see once again. Learning that she was very ill, he came at once to Sydney and was deeply touched that despite her weakness and loss of memory she recognized him and spoke his name. 

 In a memorial service held in her honour at the Mother Temple of the Antipodes on 22 August 1981 Words of 'Abdu'l-Baha were read whose reality Margaret Rowling had exemplified: May they arise to serve Thee and dedicate themselves to the Kingdom of Thy divinity.. 

 and spread far and wide Thy signs •    may they spread wide the pinions of unity and by their aid soar upward to the Kingdom of Thy singleness to become servants whom the Supreme Concourse will applaud, whose praises the dwellers in Thine all-glorious realm will utter (Based on a memoir by

 who, as mentioned in The Dawn-breakers ,'was responsible for such behaviour. as to cause him to suffer imprisonment in Tihr~n, in the same dungeon within which Baha'u'llah was confined' and who 'remained steadfast to the very end, and crowned a life of loving sacrifice with the glory of martyrdom' 2 Yadu'lldh's schooling began under a local tutor but, on his elder brother's advice, he moved to TihrAn and enrolled in the Tarbfyat School where he passed the elementary and secondary grades.

  Drawn to the army, he entered the military academy and emerged as a second lieutenant. 

 He married his cousin, Qudsfyyih; the flame of their affection for each other remained undimmed right to the end. She is serving a life sentence in an 'Adil-AbAd prison today. She is not a young woman, is in ill health and is partially paralysed. 

 The couple had four children, all active in the Cause. 

 The youngest daughter Mahvash who was in Shiraz throughout  the entire period of the recent convulsion, visited her parents in jail four times a week and was herself imprisoned during the last nine days of her father's life — a circumstance which made it possible for her to see him just before he was killed. She was called by her father 'the fearless lioness in the field of service When Yadu'116h was to be led to the place of execution, he expressed the wish to bid his wife and daughter goodbye. 

 In spite of an official ban, the guards conducted his daughter to him and she threw herself into his arms, sobbing and weeping grievously. He comforted her, bade her be composed and brave and tend her mother which, when she calmed down, she promised to do. Yadu'llTh next proceeded to his wife's cell and the same scene was reenacted there with her promising to take care of their daughter,when he had gone. Bear constantly in mind,' he assured her, 'that I am a soldier in Baha'u'llah's army and as such must needs lay down my Life for His Cause. 

 Be not perturbed, therefore, at the fate that awaits me; rejoice, rather, that so supreme a bounty has been accorded me. 

 Be steadfast and patient under all conditions and never, ever bow down to these guards or seek any help from them.' As he was being taken to the scene of his martyrdom Yadu'114h exclaimed, 'It is I who am going towards the bullet, not the bullet towards me!' 

 When he received his commission, Yadu'llhh was posted to AdhirMyj6n and chose Sa1m~s as the base of operations for his military service and his Baha'i activities, in both of which he was highly successful. Later he returned to Tihr6n with the rank of captain. After a while he was stationed at Shir~z where he seized the chance, when on official tours, to promote the Cause. He went on pilgrimage at this time and met the beloved Guardian who advised him to remain in Shfr~z to protect the Baha'is there, to be brave and to repose full trust in Baha'u'llah. The Guardian graciously designated him as the 'shield of the Faith' in that region. So it was that he made Shfr~z his permanent home and was active there until the baleful year 1955 when he planned to go on pilgrimage once again. 

 He applied for leave to do so but the commanding officer, 

Major-General B4tm6nqilich 

 'turned down his request and wrathfully threatened to place him on the retired list. Yadu'llAh responded that as a Baha'i he would readily accept whatever the authorities decreed. 

 He was, thereupon, retired with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. 

 Now he was free, at last, to serve the Cause full time, and was appointed an Auxiliary Board member. 

     On 27 February 1981 Yadu'11Th

 Vabdat and his wife, a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Sffir~z, were arrested and confined within the compass of the Haziratu'1-Quds of ShfrAz. After a preliminary examination he was included in a group of nine persons who Yadu'lldh Vahdat    See The Baha'i World, vol. XIII, p. 294.

  were assured freedom upon delivery of the effects of the House of the Bab in Shiniz. This promise was not kept, however, and they were transferred to a prison in 'Adil-AMd. After a period of suspense and unease, five of them were executed, of whom three were not only refused the fundamental human right of meeting their loved ones before execution but were denied a decent burial, armed guards being posted to ensure that appropriate interment could not take place. 

 In the diary of a fellow prisoner, Yadu'lhh had written: 'What memories flood my mind! The recollection of the divine bounty that surrounds and confirms the friends and adorns them with the mantle of a saintly character and goodly attributes and enables them to introduce the Faith to those around them in prison; the spirit of love and friendship which prevails among the loved ones and evokes the envy and jealousy of others; the prayers and invocations which ascend from our hearts by day and by night; the tears we shed as we remember the divine grace so profusely showered upon us undeserving ones; the vision of the glorious crown placed on our heads — a crown which our offspring shall cherish with pride and honour The life and actions of a Baha do not revert to him alone; their reverberations affect the entire Baha'i world.' 

    In a Letter dated 14 February

 1981 written to a friend by Mr. Valdat from 'Adil-AMd prison shortly before his martyrdom he stated, in part: 'My dear and precious brother. It has been a long time since I have had the opportunity and honour of writing to you. I am sure that the beloved of God, wherever they are, are supporting these prisoners and wronged ones. We are all certain that the friends all over the world are clinging to the hem of the robe of the Blessed Beauty, praying for us. 'Today marks the ninth month of our imprisonment.. 

 'My trial took place three days ago, from 8 — 10 February 1981. Each day the trial lasted for five gruelling hours. I have been accused of being a spy for Israel and the focal point of relationships with Zionism, corrupt on earth, etc. I lay all my affairs in the hands of God. The very first day I came to this prison, I happily accepted everything that was happening ing to me in the path of Baha'u'llah 'My dear friend, I know how much you and the other friends outside prison are worrying about us. I know that your suffering is not less than ours, but my beloved, I am over seventy-one  years old and have already lived longer than the other men in our family. 

 Suppose God — exalted be His Name ! — grants me through His Grace four or five more years? What would that matter? Old age is often more of a burden than a comfort; therefore, wouldn't it be wonderful if my blood were worthy to be shed in the path of His Faith? Would it be better if I took my last breath in a comfortable bed? 

 God forbid! I should not say what is to my liking. Whatever is the Will of God, I accept with humility and gratitude. 

 'You have sent a message that the Baha'is are grateful to the prisoners in Ir~n, that by accepting hardships and imprisonment in the path of God, the Cause of Baha'u'llah has been strengthened beyond our imagination. You have said this, my dear friend; therefore, why worry about a few months of imprisonment  which has bestowed such honour upon us. If it has spread the fame of the Cause, it is my dearest wish that I remain in prison the rest of my life Yadu'llTh's last message before his execution on 30 April 1981 said: 'Convey my greetings to all the friends and assure them that whatever befalls us is through the will of God and that whatsoever Baha'u'llah decrees will surely come to pass.' 

    Mrs. Qudsiyyih Vahdat     

 writing from prison on 12 October 1981, stated: 'My husband had no greater wish than to sacrifice himself in the path of God, but for me who was privileged to spend forty-five years of life with him, each year brimming with love, to. be separated from him is very difficult. 

 My consolation is that he has attained his destiny; well is it with him. 

 I wish you to know with what happiness he left us. He bade farewell to Mahvash who at that time was also in prison. Then he came to see me and told me, "For the sake of your children  [outside] and your daughter in prison, be brave and steadfast." 

 Then he kissed me goodbye and went away The next night when the guards who had been with him during the last moments of his life brought to me my husband's clothing and personal effects I could not bear it and became very sad. They

  admonished me, "Why are you sad? Last night your husband was full of smiles. 

 At the time of his death he said to us, 'Don't tie my hands or cover my eyes,' and placing his right hand over his heart he exclaimed, 'Don't shoot at my heart because it is the seat of my beloved!"'1 In the shooting his right thumb was struck by a bullet; while his body was being washed for burial it was noticed that his lips were smiling.'

ARTHUR JOSEPH GUSTAVE      
RUGGOO                     

 1923 — 1981  

Arthur Joseph Gustave      

 Ruggoo, who was born on 24 February 1923 in Mauritius, was among the first to respond with total conviction to the teachings of the Baha'i Faith which be learned of through Miss Ottilie 

Rhein,2 Knight of Baha'u'llah
for that island. He embraced the

Faith on 14 September      

 1956 and served it faithfully until the end of his earthly life. For many years he was a member of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly of Port-Louis.    

 From the beginning he was enthusiastic in his espousal, staunch in his conviction and very much in love with the Cause of Baha'u'llah. He made it a duty to open the Baha'i Centre every evening and he was the last to kave it in the late hours of the night. The question of every enquirer would be answered with characteristic patience and thoroughness. He had a keen interest in the prophecies of the Bible and he was careful to ensure that the person he was teaching understood that Baha'u'llah was the Promised One Whose coming was foretold in the Bible and other holy 

Writings.                  

 When, in 1966, the National Spiritual Assembly  called for pioneers for Seychelles he arose with sincerity and devotion and settled there for six years during which time he contributed greatly towards the progress of the Cause in those islands. During those years he had to return to Mauritius for short periods due to visa problems and in such intervals he would undertake special teaching projects in

R6union and Madagascar.    

 In 1974 when a call was made for a pioneer for Rodrigues he again arose and served there under difficult and trying circumstances until 1980. The slow progress of the Faith in Rodrigues and the demoralizing conditions that obtained did not discourage him; he laboured patiently knowing  that one day the seed would grow. 

 Early in 1981 he went back to Rodrigues to spend four months on a teaching project. He was to have returned to 

Mauritius on 7 May 1981    

 but he fell ill suddenly at his pioneering post and died during the night of May sixth. He was given a Baha'i burial which was attended by many people of various religious denominations as he was very well loved in Rodrigues. 

 Mr. Ruggoo served the Faith with distinction. An accomplished painter and artist, he made many exhibitions for the Baha'is. 

 He always voluntarily and gladly devoted his spare time to the maintenance, renovation and improvement of Baha properties. 

 He was always simple and humble. His selflessness and purity of heart endeared him to one and all. The National Spiritual Assembly of Seychelles sent the following message on receiving the news of his death:

   KENNETH ALLAN MORAlS       

 1942 — 1981 Kenneth Morais, born on 29 JuLy 1942 in the City of the Covenant (New York), lived an active life dedicated to the service of humanity until he departed this world on 29 May 1981. Kenneth, or 'Ka' as he was also called, was the son of 

Steibel and Kathryn Morais.

 Steibel emigrated from Jamaica, West Indies, to the United States, and married Kathryn who bore him two daughters and two sons who enjoyed a Christian upbringing. 

 After graduating from Public School 46 and the High School of Music and Art in New 

York, Ka attended Brooklyn

 graphy. As an artist he made collages, painted with oils and acrylics, did scrimshaw and made animated and regular films, but he was best known as a photographer. His most important photographic works were his 'Terrainiums', or 'interior landscapes', striking and provocative threedimensional photographic constructions which won him acclaim. He exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem whose director, Mary S. Campbell, described him as 'a fine photographer, one whose phoiographs it. was an honour to exhibit at the Studio Museum. Shortly after Ka's passing, the 

Black Photographers'      

 Association of New York, at a meeting held in his honour to which some members of the Baha'i community were invited, awarded him their certificate of merit. 

 Ka became a Baha'i in the 1960s, despite the disapproval of his mother, and actively engaged in its service. He was bent on serving not only his country but mankind. 

 As soon as he was discharged from the United States army in which he served in the war in Vietnam he busied himself rendering assistance to refugees in Thailand and Korea where he taught the Baha Faith, distributed its literature,  and worked towards translating its books into the Khmer language. 
In 1978 — 1979 he taught     

English at Ube Academy     

 in lJbe, Japan. His service in Thailand was interrupted in 1981 when he had to return to the United States to take care of his mother. 

 Ka took his leave from this world on a warm sunny day in late spring. 

 It happened in Washington Square Park, New York, where he was taking photographs. 

 He came upon a group of musicians and began to dance to their music, delighting the many children among the large crowd of spectators, when he suddenly fell to the ground as a result of a heart attack. Medical assistance proved futile. He was buried at the Veteran's Cemetery, Long Island. 

 Jack Walker, whose fireside meetings Ka had attended, offers this description: 'Kenneth was selfless. 

 Material wealth was not important to him. He was more interested in his spiritual growth.' Another friend states that he 'was soft-spoken, reserved and had a keen gift of observation. 

 His conspicuous figure and his personality will be remembered wherever he visited.' Vaughan Smith, a fellow believer in Thailand, has written, 'Kenneth had been pioneering in Korea for a year and had been

  travel teaching in Thailand twice. During the Kampuchean crisis of December 1979 he was so moved that he quit his job in Korea and came to Thailand to help the Khmer refugees at the border. We thought that if he wanted to help refugees he should go into the Lao camps where there were Baha'is. He, however, went to help the Khmer masses. He had a really dynamic personality and was loved and respected by us all be was a true servant of mankind he returned to the U.S.A. to help his ailing mother and never had the chance to continue his wonderful pioneering work.' 

 In a letter written on its behalf on 13 December 

1981 the Universal House   

 of Justice expressed sorrow at the passing of this 'stalwart Baha'i pioneer and travelling teacher in several Asian countries who strove to help the friends in these areas. His assistance to the refugees of these strife-torn lands, especially to the Cambodians, and his efforts [to facilitate translations of the Baha'i Writings into Khmer] will be remembered by future generations. Ardent prayers will be offered in the Holy Shrines for the progress of this servant's soul.' 

 His passing was commemorated by his sister, Lisa Morais, in her poem, in Memoriam': My brother Died in celebration While dancing In a park. 

 A circle formed; He was its centre. 

  My brother laughed As he leaped into the air Karate kicks, joyous movement. 

 The crowd whistled its approval Until, in the middle of the dance, His body jerked, losing its rhythms. 
And crashed to the ground. 
                           
Later                      

 We heard news of the news of the performance. 

 Two women told us of the joy they Felt while watching him. 

 A true celebration of life, they said, A fitting death for a wanderer. 

  Your family is not left With the emptiness of a tragedy We know you died A pied piper Leading the way with your dance.

  On 28 May 1981, one day before the commemoration of the Ascension of Baha'u'llah, Rita van Sombeek, one of the first Dutch believers, passed away at the age of seventy-Rita 

Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek

  eight. She had pioneered for the Cause of God and served Baha'u'llah faithfully to the end of her life. 

 Rita was an example for many and her history is inextricably bound up with that of the Dutch Baha'i community. In connection with her share of service she continually referred to the statement of the Guardian's to the effect that God uses every willing instrument he needs for the promotion of His Cause; it was her explanation for the many wonderful circumstances which had determined her life, a subject which she never tired speaking about: 'The firm I was working for in Amsterdam transferred me to New York. I arrived there on 1 May 1940, just before the May 10th invasion of the Netherlands. Why was I so fortunate? Through another coincidence I then heard about the Baha'i Faith, and after attending a lecture by Stanwood Cobb' I was immediately attracted and enthusiastic, and thereafter I hardly ever missed a study class or lecture.' Yet despite her enthusiasm, she did not accept the Faith. 'I attributed my indecision to my atheism and my deep-rooted prejudice against all mission work. Then, in 1945, I heard Dorothy Baker speak about the 

Administrative  Order.    

 I realized, then, that what held me back was my selfishness and a lack of spirit of sacrifice, for I recognized that if I became a Baha'i, I would feel obliged td return to the Netherlands. 

 I know that my life passed before me in a flash. 

Suddenly Dorothy Baker     

 stood before me and said, "Now you are a Baha'i," and, further, "Pioneer!"' After her enrolment during the summer school at Green Acre, Rita came in contact with Mr. and Mrs. Max Greeven,2 an American  Baha couple who, in 1930, moved from New York to Bremen, Germany, and then to The Hague where they remained from 1937 until 1940. Mr. Greeven was responsible for the publication in Holland of Captain I A. Liebau's translations into Dutch of The Hidden Words of 

Baha'u'llah and Baha'u'llah

 and the New Era by Dr. J. E. Esslemont, editions of which all but a few copies were, unfortunately, destroyed in the bombing of Rotterdam. At Mr. Greeven's prompting Rita wrote to Shoghi Effendi offering to go to the Netherlands,  although she felt inexperienced and she 1 See 'In Memoriam', p. 814. 

2 See 'In Memoriam', The   

 Baha'i World, vol. XIII, p. 909. 

 was able to get only a six-month leave of absence, and received a reply written on his behalf on 5 March 1946 stating, 'The need for Baha'i workers in Europe is enormously great,' and encouraging her to 'do everything possible to bring this Message of hope to people who have endured so much misery and disappointment'. 

 She sold everything she had of value, wanting to be free to devote her life to the Faith. 
   At the end of 'World War   

IL Rita's sister, Georgette

 ('Jetty'),3 joined her in the United States and eventually became a Baha. 

 In response to the second Seven Year Plan which called for a systematic programme of teaching in ten European countries the sisters left for Europe on 25 September 1946 aboard the Westerdam, sharing a cabin with Edna True, chairman of the European Teaching 

Committee.  In Rita's     

 words: 'While in America, Jetty had begun to translate; later we worked together on Mr. Esslemont's book after it was decided by the European Teaching Committee  not to reprint the old edition. After a long search we found the printer Grapo who received the manuscript in January 1947 after we had worked on it for many hours a day for four months, in an ice-cold room with only school dictionaries available. In April the edition was ready. Also that spring most of the pioneers arrived in Europe and could start the teaching work. On 21 April 1947 the first Local Spiritual 

Assembly in Amsterdam      
was formed.'               

 In 1949 Rita returned to the United States in order to maintain her American citizenship which she greatly prized. From there she went as a pioneer to Sweden. At this time a friendship began with another believer of Dutch heritage, Mrs. Geertrui Bates, who wrote of her, 'Rita was a very attractive, indeed a striking woman, fluent and convincing whenever she talked about the Faith. She was athletic and loved skiing. I met her again in 1951 after she had returned to Amsterdam. With the encouragement of the Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery, Rita went to Italy and began a study of Italian, but she found her stay there disheartening because there was so little receptivity to the Faith. 

 In addition to English, she was also fluent in 

German. When

At one stage more than 160 Baha'i and other children were attending the school and learning Baha prayers and songs. The school is still being conducted.

 The news of his death was shocking and unexpected. 

 On Saturday, 30 May, a Baha'i funeral was held at which more than 400 people were present. 

 Even his funeral was a means of teaching and procla mation of the Faith. 

 His body was put to rest in a spot not very far from the Regional Baha'i Centre that he loved so much.

      MASH FARHANOI              

 19 12 — 1981 Dr. Masih Farhangi was born in June 1912 in a village near Shahsav6s in the province of Gilan, Iran. At age five he started atteinding a school established and directed by his father, a learned clergyman in the town of Langar6d. He was still a young boy when his father embraced the Baha'i Faith, through contact with 

Mr. Tar6zu'11&h of Qazvfn  

 (later known as the Hand of the Cause of God Tar&zu'lhh Samandari), changed his attire and started to spread the Baha'i message to the extent that in the religious education classes at the school he mentioned the Baha'i religion along with other religions of the world. 

 At home young Masih was encouraged by his father to read the Bible as well as the Qur'an, and he accompanied his father to Baha'i meetings where he chanted prayers and passages from the Holy Writings. He attended high school first in Rasht and then in Tihr~n. 

 While in Tihr~n he associated with Baha'i youth and received Loving guidance from Saifu'lHh Majidi who used to take him to Baha'i study classes. He gradually deepened his knowledge of the Faith and at age fifteen became a devoted Baha'i youth. He continued to study the Baha'i Writings both in Persian and Arabic. 

 He enrolled in the college of medicine of the University of Tihrttn and earned his living expenses by teaching science and French at the Baha'i Tarbiyat School. His knowledge of the Faith was further enriched through association with such scholars as 'Azizu'116h MisMh and 

Fddil-i Shirdzi. During    

 summer vacations he used to go back to his hQme town where, at the home of his parents, he held firesides to which he invited his friends. 

 He also taught classes for Baha children; among those attending were his brothers and sisters. 

 In addition, he used to travel to villages in the area where he met and held discussions with his father's acquaintances, usually learned divines. 

 After graduating in 1937 he married Qamaru'1-Muhik, a graduate from medical college, who was not at that time a Baha'i but who later embraced the Faith through association  with the friends. Dr. Farhangil started his medical practice in Tihr~n and later, upon advice  from Bah6'ifriends, transferred to Raslit.


<p767>
IN MEMORIAM                767

     In June 1941 the Farhangi 

 family, aware of the Guardian's wish for Persian believers to pioneer in 'IrAq, managed to gather together sufficient funds through the sale of their belongings to settle in that country. 

 World War II was raging and it was not an easy task, with two small children, to function in a strange land where shortages of food and medicine were being experienced. Dr. Farhangf continued to be active as a travelling teacher between Baghd6d and Karkiik, and was honoured by election to the National Spiritual Assembly of 'Ir4q. When, in 1943, the Persian Baha'is were forced to leave 'IrAq and return to fran, Dr. Farhangi, who had spent all his savings, was advised by the NationM Spiritual Assembly to settle and practise in Rasht where, with the help of an old friend, he managed to procure the necessary equipment and open his office. Obstacles beyond his control prevented Dr. Farhangf from pionedr-ing to Bahrein in 1944, as he had hoped he might, and he had to be content with going back to GilAn where he reopened his office and resumed his travels, teaching in the villages of L6hfj6n, journeying mostly on foot along mountain routes. 

 From 1949 through 1954 he served as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran, and in June 1954 he had the privilege of making his pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines and attaining the presence of the beloved Guardian who inspired him with the determination to serve once again in the pioneering field. 

 It was his wish to go to one of the foreigd goals of the Ten Year Plan but could not readily find a means of doing so as he had limited resources and was responsible for the support of his wife and four children and his mother. In this period he frequently dreamed of Shoghi Effendi who would emphasize the necessity of pioneering abroad. 

 Finally he wrote a letter to the Guardian, through 

Shoghi Effendi's Persian  

 secretary, Dr. Lutfu'116h Hakim, in which he implored the Guardian to pray at the Holy Shrines so that the object of his longing might be fulfilled and the means for his journey to foreign lands might be provided. A month later offeTs of employment for both Dr. Farhangi and his wife came from Indonesia, At the same time he received a visa for travelling to Turkey. After consultation about the matter at a session of the National 

      Masih Farhangi            

  Spiritual Assembly in which the latest letter from the Guardian asking the Persian believers to help strengthen the Baha'i community of Turkey was read, the decision of the National Spiritual Assembly was in favour of the Farhangf family pioneering to Turkey. 

 Obedient to this decision, Dr. Farhangi and his family set out for Turkey in preference to Indonesia, in spite of the fact that there was no chance of employment and their savings were enough to maintain them for only three years. 

 Both Dr. FaThangi and his wife registered as graduate students in a medical college and with divine assistance managed to stay in Turkey until the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly in 1959. Dr. Farhangi was elected secretary. Forced to return to IrAn at the end of that year, he resumed his medical practice in Rasht and was again elected a member of the National Assembly. 

 lIe served with distinction on the Auxiliary Board and, in 1968, was appointed a member of the Continental 

Board of Counsellors.     

 After participating in the Palermo Conference in 1968, Dr. Farhangi gave up his


<p768>
768                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  medical practice and devoted his full time to the service of the Faith in his new capacity. He and his wife travelled in India, from north to south, and in accordance with instructions from the Universal House of Justice they also visited Sri Lanka. In 1973 he was present in the Holy Land for the third International Convention and participated in the consulta-fions  of the Hands of the Cause and Continental 

Boards of Counsellors      

 following which he continued his travels to countries in central and western Asia. The method of teaching employing the especially prepared album which Dr. Farhangf introduced in Iran was of great assistance and inspiration to thousands of Baha'is, particularly the youth. 

 Dr. Farhangi was arrested on 6 February 1980, and after being imprisoned for a year and a half in Evin Prison he was executed on 24 June 1981. His funeral was attended by a large number of Baha'i friends. 

 His family received many expressions of sympathy from the many nonBahA'is who loved and admired him, including some who had been in prison with him but who were later released. 

 They remarked on the calm and dignified way in which he accepted his fate, a~d described how he had won their hearts by serving as a physician in prison, tending the sick and offering solace and comfort to prisoners who were condemned to death. His death was deplored by his medical colleagues, and the Medical Association of Raslit made a written protest. 

 Some twenty days before his martyrdom  he met his family with a smil& when they visited him in prison. 

 'My destiny is bright; don't worry about me,' he told his wife and sisters. 'Since they have executed a few members  of the Auxiliary Board, a Counsellor is also needed.' 

 Dr. Farhangf's daughter in Canada explained in an interview pvblished in the 1 July 1981 issue of the Dundas Star Journal that her father, a cardiologist, had been asked to treat patients in the prison when he was imprisoned himself. 

 His treatment, she remarked, was not only physical, but mental and spiritual for those facing death and possible torture. 

 'My father always served throughout his life, helping people — a true example of a good person.' The letters she had received from her father the week before he was killed were inspiring. 

 'I could see in his writing how happy he was serving the people, and I realized that he was ready for what God wanted him to do. He prayed every day that all the problems of the world will one day end. And, he told us how to be happy and serve humanity.' He was keenly interested in history and philosophy, was a writer and painter and spoke six languages. 

 His last letter written from prison was addressed to his wife. 'At this last moment of my transitory life, when I am on my way to the realm of eternity, I bid you farewell. I beg you to accept, with great patience and forbearance, what God has willed. Be thankful; be patient!' he admonished. 

 'During our forty-four years together I have felt nothing but tranquillity and comfort. I had no wish except companionship with you. I hope you are pleased with me and will not deny me your loving prayers. 

 I am greatly relieved at this moment, content and pleased. 

 I yield my thanks to God that He has vouchsafed to me this final overwhelming blessing. 

 Praised be God, the Lord of all the worlds!' With words Such as these Dr. Masih Farhangi turned his gaze from the mortal world and with light step and joyous heart set out upon the crimson path of martyrdom.

IN MEMORIAM               769

     Muhammad Mustdfd           

  last remnant of the dedicated band of first Egyptian Baha'is. Born in the remote Nile Delta village of El Dhahriya to a fanatical Muslim father, raised in an entrenched Islami community, tutored in a Quranic village school which provided no more than primary school education. Muhammad MustafA, a telegraph operator at fifteen, rose, through the creative breath of faith in Baha'u'llah Whom he spontaneously and unconditionally accepted at the first hint, to become one of the veteran Baha'i administrators, an experienced and reliable translator for the beloved Guardian, a defender of the Cause in the heart of the Islamic and Arab world, the subject of concern of both Egyptian Muslim clergy and state officials, a diffuser of the Glad 

Tidings in Egypt, Sudan    

 and North Africa as well as other African countries, a Knight of Baha'u'llah, the rallying point and source of love and encouragement to the valiant Egyptian Baha'i community deprived of its administrative framework since 1960, and, during the last six years of his life, a member of the Continental Board of Counsellors. 

 He first heard the name ''Abdu'l-Baha' at age sixteen when his friend, 'Abdu'r — Rahm4n Rushdf, who had just accepted the Faith, wisely put a booklet entitled Ten Days in the Light of Acca on his telegraph office table in Etai-E1-Baroud, a town midway between Cairo and Alexandria, when Mustaf6 dropped in casually to keep him company. 

 A third person, an interim railway .station master, picked it up and commented unfavourably on 'Abdu'l-Baha and His principles. Muhammad Mu§taf4's reaction was spontaneous: 'A Person with such principles and so many followers cannot but be True. I am one of His followers!' 

 Some time later, he was taken to a meeting by Rushdi. The subject of the signs of the advent of the Promised One were discreetly approached by the experienced Baha'i teacher and friends. 

 Muhammad Mus-laf6,  to the astonishment of all present, suddenly exclaimed, 'He has come and His name is 'Abdu'l-Baha .' And Mustaf6 joined the ranks of the faithful. 

 Transferred to Tanta, he later went to Port Said where he shaTed with the other believers the persecutions of 1919 and 1920. He was not physically harmed, but he was among the frontline defenders of the Faith. He wrote to the Master and received three loving Tablets bearing the salutations, 0 thou who art turning thy face towards God!, 0 thou who art attracted by the fragrances of God! and 0 brave friend! 

 In the service of the beloved Guardian he was privileged to visit the Holy Shrines almost yearly up to 1933. Every moment he spent with his beloved remained imprinted in his mind and heart. The beloved Guardian once admitted him to his office when he was ill in bed and told him that even though ill and unable to move he had to carry on, so great was the volume of work before him. Mustaffi learnt then the need for the friends to intensify their efforts to assist the Guardian with his overwhelming load. Shoghi Effendi relied upon Mustafa for a number of English and Arabic translations; till the end of his life, he devoted himself to translating into Arabic the Guardian's messages and incomparable prose. 

 'My dear and precious fellow-worker,' the Guardian once addressed a postscript to him;     Your perseverance, your utter devotion, your sublime faith, your selfless


<p770>
770                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  labours are all graven upon my heart.' And in another, Shoghi Effendi wrote, 'Your translation of the document will be of great service and assistance to the Cause. 

 You should rejoice and be happy and thankful. 

 I assure you of my prayers for your success and spiritual advancement. I will never forget  you.' In two other communications the Guardian addressed him as '0 beloved of the hearts of the friends' and '0 faithfuL friend'. 

    The first Local Spiritual 
Assemblies and the first  

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Egypt saw Muhammad Mustafli an active member; for many years he was national secretary — an office he discharged most ably — and later chairman. Until he pioneered in 1953 he served on the national and on local assemblies. 

 His Life contained a series of 'firsts' for the Egyptian Baha community. 

 He was the first to marry in an exclusively Baha'i ceremony without the customary traditional Muslim rites (his bride, Farida Naimi, was privileged on the morrow to attain the cordial and loving presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf); the first to register his children as Baha at birth; the first to be appointed Auxiliary Board member and, later, Counsel-br  from amongst the Egyptian believers. 

 The Guardian's announcement of the Ten Year Crusade made him restless. With meagre resources he pioneered to the desolate Spanish Sahara for which service he was named a Knight of Baha'u'llah. Denied residence, he resettled for a year in Benghazi, Libya. The ascension of the beloved Guardian caught him ill in bed in his home in Cairo. 

 So great was the shock that it could be said to have endangered his life. Yet he managed to write to his fellow members of the Regional Spiritual  Assembly of NorthWest Africa exhorting them to turn to the World Centre and the Hands of the Cause. 

 Between 1954 and 1960 he travelled in north, east and west Africa helping, amongst other activities, in the erection of the Regional Spiritual 

Assembly of NorthWest    
Africa in 1956. Wherever  

 he went he was a source of happiness and encouragement to the friends and he assisted them in their teaching efforts through his knowledge of the 

Scriptures and Writings.  

 In 1958 he returned to Egypt. Clouds of opposition were collecting. A presidential decree, in 1960, disbanded all Baha'i assemblies in Egypt and the believers there flocked around their two Auxiliary Board members, Muhammad 

Mustafi and 'Abdu'r-Rahim Yazdf.

 In 1965 a number of Baha'is were summarily incarcerated under serious false accusations and risked simple disappearance; Mul3ammad Mustafd was at the head of the list. 

 Without hesitation he took full responsibility and requested, in vain, that the other believers be set free. Released under bail, he and the other victims remained subject to restraint until June 1967 when he and an even larger number of friends were thrown into a concentration camp. 

 Auxiliary Board member 'Abdu'r-Rahim  Yazdi was expelled from the country leaving Mu~taf6 as the oniy reference for the loved ones in Egypt. Released after six month~, these believers, and the Baha'i community as a whole, continued to suffer even greater restrictions. 

In March 1972 Mustaffi    

 and ninety-two believers ranging in age from two to seventy-five years, including thirty-three women and two children, were imprisoned in Tanta and publicly accused in the mass media of treason, espionage and misconduct. Miraculously released under bail after forty days of suffering, those loved ones and the whole community  gathered round Muhammad Mustaffi who becanie their comforter and adviser. His long experience in the administrative and teaching fields, his relatively wide travels, and his calm and percipient spirit were the basis of the guidance emanating from him to the friends. 

 A deeply loving heart, eyes that saw no evil, and a mind enriched with memories of the beloved Guardian brought him so close to the hearts of the believers in Egypt that for them he was a father or a brother. 

 His modest home was the haven for all, and despite meagre resources his wife somehow accommodated  everyone who approached their ever-open  door. The friends simply loved to come and sit with them both, and quickly enveloped the couple with such love and attention that any visitor could not help but notice and marvel. 

 As the older generation in Egypt slowly left this world, Muhammad Mustafd, guided by the instructions of the beloved Universal House of Justice, literally reared the younger generation, moulding it into a loving, united


<p771>
IN MEMORIAM                771

  and active community. 

 By 1978, when he was eighty, age and longsuffering and hardship showed clearly their effects, but he continued travelling, comforting  and visiting in Egypt. The loss of his wife in October 1979 was a staggering blow; she had been his mainstay for fifty-three years and her self-sacrifice and self-effacement had permitted  him to dedicate his life to the Faith. Two of her three sons and her only daughter bad pioneered outside Egypt in 1952, 1954 and 1956 and she had suffered terribly during the p&iods when her husband was pioneering, travelling or in prison. Yet so encompassing was her love that to neighbours and friends, Baha'is and non-Bah6'is, she was the living example of the mother for the New Day. A letter of condolence received from the Universal House of Justice seemed to call forth from MustafA a final concerted effort to serve the loved ones. 

 Towards the end of 1980 his health seemed to deteriorate rapidly; in 1981 he often intimated that his end had come and prayed tearfully that 'the House of Justice be content with me'. Just two days before he passed away he painfully walked up to a rear door in his room and waved goodbye to the few flowers and trees he loved in his small garden; and as the friends tried to give him his medicine he would refuse it saying, 'You are only trying to delay the longed-for encounter.' 

 Thus ended the life of Muhammad Mustaf6 who was dedicated to the Master, the beloved Guardian and the Universal House of Justice; who served on four local and two national Spiritual Assemblies and as Auxiliary Board member and Counsellor; who taught and travelled for the Faith in many African countries; who translated dozens of messages and documents and wrote two most significant booklets in Arabic, a book of proofs in English and a similar but mote elaborate one in Arabic; who was three times imprisoned for the Faith yet defended it before clergy, in the press, and from Covenant-breakers; who was loved by the friends; who was loving, humble, and ever-encouraging; whose home was a haven for everyone who cared to come in; and whose numerous gifts in his beautiful handwriting of Tablets, prayers and the Kitab-i-Aqdas  will constitute a touching and educating  remembrance for his grandchildren and for generations to come. 

 Before his death, on 15 August 1981, he had asked that his grave be the simplest, and placed lower than all others at the Baha'i cemetery in Cairo. 

 His loved ones obeyed his wish; but in their hearts the memory of M4rammad Mustafd is a monument highly cherished and remembered.

  M. E. LUKMANJ 

MOHAMMED EBRAHJMJI LUKMANI (MUHAMMAD
IBRKH{MJI LUOMANI)         

 1896 — 1981 Dr. M. E. Lukmani was one of the bestknown Baha'is in India and was known to Baha'is far beyond its borders. A homoeopathic physician by training, he was able to present the Faith to many who came to him as patients. He learned of the Cause of Baha'u'llah from the renowned teacher, Mr. Mihr'ali Munji, who devoted many months to confirming him. By 1920 Dr. Lukmani was a fullyfledged believer  and was actively teaching. Mr. GhulAm-'Ali Kurlawala, who became the Knight of Baha'u'llah for Daman, was among the many whom he taught and who arose to render outstanding service to the Faith. 

 Dr. Lukmani was soon elected a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Bombay and within two years was serving as its chairman. He strove to intensify teaching activities in Bombay by arranging public lectures which prominent scholars of the Faith from East and West — including Keith Ransom Keller, Fred Schopilocher, 

Mirza Malimad Zarq~ni      

 and Mirza Munfr Nabflz~deh — were invited to address. By this means, and by press interviews, the Message was presented to the leading citizens of Bombay. 

 In the 1930s Dr. Lukmani was elected a member of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 and carried out his responsibilities with full devotion. He made many tours throughout India and travelled, as well, to Burma and IrAn. Everywhere he taught the Faith with great proficiency. 

 In 1936 he was invited to make his pilgrimage to the Holy Land and was privileged to meet Shoghi Effendi for whom he had deep love and respect and with whom he corre


<p772>

 M. E. Lukmani sponded frequently from 1936 until 1956. When he returned from the Holy Land he was a new man. 

 He increased the tempo of his activities, undertook more frequent teaching trips and took a heightened interest in national 

Baha'i activities. In      

 the early 1940s he pioneered to Hyderabad, and after some years moved on to Surat and Sholapur. Everywhere he went, many accepted the Faith through him. 

On 6 May 1942 the Guardian 

 penned in his own hand, as a postscript to a letter written on his behalf to Dr. Lukmani, 'May the Beloved bless abundantly and continually your high endeavours, and reward you a thousandfold for the admirable manner in which you have arisen to serve His Faith in virgin territories, and at so critical a time in the history of the world.' 

 Dr. Lukmani participated in summer and winter schools throughout India, accompanied visiting teachers from abroad on their lecture tours, and took a keen interest in the purchase of the national Ha4ratu'1-.Quds in New Delhi, gratified that its acquisition had pleased the Guardian. 

 Shoghi Effendi wrote to him on 25 March 1943, 'Your noble efforts are highly meritorious in the sight of God. I am deeply thankful, and will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart. Persevere in your historic task, and rest assured, and be happy.' 

 Dr. Lukmani's most important service to the Faith was his pioneering to Sri Lanka (Ceylon) in response to the Guardian's appeal. 

On 23 May 1949 Shoghi      

 Effendi's secretary wrote on his behalf, 'You have no idea of how happy it has made him to know that at last a pioneer has carried the torch of Baha'u'llah to that country! A service highly meritorious in the sight of God and one long overdue.' In the Guardian's own hand was appended, 'Your spontaneous and exemplary response has rejoiced my heart and evoked my intense admiration. I am eager to learn of the progress of your work for which I cherish the brightest hopes.' Later, Shoghi Effendi referred to him as Fdtih, 'the (spiri-tual)  "Conqueror" of Ceylon'. He performed outstanding services in Sri Lanka, and saw the formation of Local Spiritual Assemblies. 

 Thus the groundwork was laid for the establishment, in 1962, of the National Spiritual Assembly, with its seat in Colombo where, with the assistance of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of India, a beautiful national Hazi-ratu'1-Quds had been purchased. 

 Having completed his mission in Sri Lanka, Dr. Lukmani returned to India in 1956 and settled in Aurangabad where he continued to reside until October 1981 when the Messenger of Joy called him to the realm beyond. 

 His earthly remains were laid to eternal rest in Aurangabad, while his soul winged its way to reunion with Shoghi Effendi whom he had loved more than anything in life. 

 Dr. Luk-mani'  s services undoubtedly ensure him a permanent place in the Baha'i history of India.

Nhlumba Bertha Mkhize     

 was born on 6 June 1889 at Embo, near Umkomaas, on the south coast of Natal. liTer father was 

Mashobane Mkhize. Her     

 early years were spent at Embo, after which she attended the High School for Girls at Inanda. In about 1907 she became a teacher at the Inanda 

Seminary (American Mission)

 and remained there until 1911 when she started a tailoring business in Durban. 

 Bertha was one of the first black women to establish a business of her own in South Africa. One reason for this was that she had achieved the status of an 'emancipat~d' woman. 

 In African law, if the parents feel that their daughter is upright and faithful, they may appear before a magistrate and sign a document granting their daughter the full rights of a man over the family household. At the age of twenty Bertha was emancipated,  so that, unlike most Zulu women, her brothers had no power over her. She could become the head of the kraal. 

 She never married. Bertha remained at her tailoring business until 1965 when the City 

Council                   

 of Durban decided to move the African businesses out of that area. 

 During those years, and especially the early ones, Bertha was a pioneer in the struggle for women's rights. She also campaigned against cattle culling and the dipping of people against typhus; took part in the defiance campaign over the pass laws, for which she spent a few months in prison; worked assiduously for literacy classes for about twenty years and at a cThche and a sewing group for at least twenty-five years. She also worked for a few years for an Indian charity at Phoenix, oA the north coast. In this same period Bertha served at various times as president of the African Women's 

Association, the African  
National Congress Women's 
League and the Durban and 

District Women's League.  

 Bertha learned of the Baha'i Faith in 1958 from Angelo Nyaba in Natal, and after a short but spirited investigation embraced it on 1 January J959. She attended classes conducted by Prof. Bishop Brown and Mrs. Baha'i Ford (now Winckler). In the 

Cause of Baha'u'llah, Bertha

 found the message of unity and justice she had always longed for, and came to realize that in order to have the peace which was her greatest desire, unity must be with all people and justice must be for all people; there must be love and forgiveness and a spiritual foundation in a Divine Message. Having been an active political figure, Bertha took some time to see the need to follow the Baha'i teaching of not taking part in politics. 

 But gradually, as her heart became increasingly filled with the inspiration she found in the Writings of Baha'u'llah, she resigned her affiliations. At the age of seventy, when most people are thinking of retirement, Bertha arose to promote the Baha'i Faith. For five years she worked actively in Natal and Zululand, and when the call came for a Baha pioneer to live in Zululand, Bertha settled in Gezinsila, Eshowe. In cooperation with several other local Baha'i teachers, she helped establish a total of twenty-eight Baha'i communities in KwaZulu. 

 She remained in KwaZulu for nine years, trudging with her cane from village to village, bringing the 

Glad Tidings of Baha'u'llah. 

 In 1968 she was elected to the Nafional Spiritual Assembly of South and West Africa, and served on that body until April 1969. She was a prolific translator of Baha'i literature


<p774>
774                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  into Zulu. Her translations include many prayers, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, the Kitdb-i-Iqdn, the life-story of Baha'u'llah, stories of 'Abdu'l-Baha, 

Guidance for Local     
Spiritual Assemblies   
and The New Garden.    

 In 1975, at the age of eighty-six, Bertha's health began to fail, but she remained at her pioneering post until 1978 when she willed her home at Gezinsila to the Baha'i Faith and moved to Inanda, where she had received her education. 
She served on the      

Spiritual Assembly     

 of Inanda until her passing on 3 October 1981 at the age of ninety-two. On receiving this news the Universal House of Justice cabled on 8 October:

       1889 — 1981              

 Knight of Baha'u'llah   

  The soul that hat/i remained faithful to the Cause of God, and stood unwaveringly firm in His Path shal4 after his ascension, be possessed of such power that all the worlds which the Almighty hath created, can benefit through him. 

  Olivia Kelsey was born on her family farm in Delaware County, Ohio, U.S.A., on 9 

February  1889. Her   

 mother died when Olivia was eleven years old, and two years later she left home to live with a maternal uncle and his wife in Cleveland. 

 Religion was, in Olivia's mind, a clouded question because of the religious conflict in her home. 

 Her father was Catholic and her mother Protestant. 

 She said that she reflected on religion and on the great men who had appeared throughout history, won~dering why they did not appear again. The answer to her questions came when she met Francis Arthur Kelsey and learned of the coming of Baha'u'llah. 

She married Arthur     

 in 1929 and in 1932 became a member of the Baha Faith. Their home in New York became a center of Baha'i activity and hospitality. Olivia began to write poems and articles on diverse subjects,  many of which were published in World Order magazine. 

 A religious-historical drama depicting the early history of the 

Baha'i Faith, 'Two    

 shall Appear', was published, as well as a pageant entitled 'Had They Believed', a scenario, 'A Universal Language', and a satire, 

'Gulliver's Return'.   

 During her years in New York city Olivia compiled her book Bahd'iAnswers which was published in 1947. It is a collection of ninety-five  questions about the Baha'i Faith with answers compiled from the Writings of• the Bab, Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, and is an invaluable aid to teachers and students of the Cause. 

 Olivia became deeply interested in the welfare of animals and did intensive research on the subject. Her source of inspiration, was a statement by 'Abdu'l-Baha, Educate the children in their infancy to be very kind to animals from a Tablet the Ma~ter sent to Roy Wilhelm; she quoted it in many of her talks over radio and television on programs sponsored by local and national humane organizations. 

 When in Monaco, pioneering under the Ten Year Crusade, she sent a copy of this Tablet to Prince 

Rainier and Princess Grace

 who were great animal lovers. A friend once remarked that 'Olivia brought the Baha Faith to the animal kingdom'. 

 After Arthur's death in 1937, Olivia began Baha'u'llah her long career as a Baha pioneer. Under the first Seven Year Plan (1937 — 1944) she pioneered to Louisville, Kentucky. 

 She worked in many communities and helped many others with newspaper, radio and television publicity. Public information and public relations were subjects which engrossed her attention during the entire fifty years of her Baha life. These fields were at that time unexplored territory to the Baha community in general, as very few believers had as yet taken an interest in such forms of proclamation activity. From the very beginning she made efforts to reach out to small town newspapers, even visiting such communities to make personal contacts. 

 In 1944 she moved to to Kansas where she served on the Regional Teaching Committee until the call for pioneers under the. Ten Year Crusade in 1953. She then retired from her profession. 

 In 1954 she kft for Monaco, a move

      Olivia Kelsey             

  which earned her the title Knight of Baha'u'llah, bestowed by the beloved Guardian. She visited the Holy Land on pilgrimage in the winter of 1954. 

 The stojies of her pilgrimage and of meeting the beloved Guardian have thrilled and inspired many. While on pilgrimage  the Guardian encouraged Olivia to teach in France after the first Local Spiritual Assembly  in Monaco had been firmly established. Accordingly, in 1959, in response to a call from the Hands of the Cause, she went to Toulouse and later to Montpellier to assist the Baha'is in thdse cities, following the crisis resulting from activities of Covenant breakers. During the ten years she spent in Monaco and France she attended many European 

Summer Schools, the Frankfurt

 Conference in 1958, and the World Jubilee in 

London in 1963. Because   

 of poor health, she returned to the United States in 1964, in her seventy-fifth year, and settled in Columbus, Ohio, and became an active member of that community, devoting herself particularly to publicity work and extension teaching. 

When the Five Year Plan   

 was launched in 1974, she was able to fulfill her wish to make teaching trips to South 

Carolina and West Virginia.

 She was then eighty-five years old. 

 When, in old age, Olivia was no longer able to live alone, she lived first with friends near Columbus and then with friends in Zenia and Yellow Springs. 

 Her final months were spent at the Friends' 

Care Center in Yellow     

 Springs. Neither ill health nor limited means diminished her will to teach or dimmed her devotion to the Cause she loved. Until the day she passed to the 

AbM Kingdom — 13 October    

 1981 — she was actively teaching her nurses and all who came in contact with her. 

 Olivia Kelsey stands firmly in the tradition of world-minded women of strong character who emerged in the early years of the Baha'i Faith in America. All who knew her well were enriched and deeply touched by her example. Her spirit, her talents and her capacities will be sorely missed. 

 The following cablegrams were received at her passing:

 The family home was a centre of great activity


<p776>
776                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and the children had the bounty of participating in the many meetings which took place there. 

 Like her illustrious brother, Rahmatu-'11Th MulAjir, Hishmat from an early age was aflame with love of the Cause and filled with a great desire to serve it. She became the very embodiment of the true Baha'i teacher — self less, detached, totally reliant on God and both fearless and tireless in her efforts to spread abroad the teachings. 

 India, Kuwait, Spain, Venezuela and the Sudan were but some of the places where her loving labours were~ expended. 

 It was in the latter country to which she and her husband, Amin, had gone as pioneers in July 1981 that she fell victim to cerebral malaria and died on 25 October 1981. 

 'Ever since her arrival in Khartoum', it was reported; 'our beloved sister Hishmat Adiparvar was engaged in actively teaching the Faith, and in deepening and inspiring the believers in this country. 

 She continually encouraged the Baha'i communities to participate  in joint teaching efforts and aroused their enthusiasm by relating inspiring accounts of the progress of the Faith in India, the Philippines,  South and Central America and many other countries she had either visited or bad news of. Her own long and valuable expe-Hishmat 

Adiparvar                  

 riences in teaching the Faith were also a source of inspiring stories. 

 She was a warm gracious hostess and constantly entertained Baha'is and their friends at her own home or at the homes of other friends. She was particularly intent on teaching women and deepening the Baha'i women's knowledge of the Faith. She was a cause of unity, love and inspiration to all the friends.' 

 Among the last activities she undertook were a teaching trip to various centres in Eastern Sudan and attendance at a Summer School organized by one of the Local Spiritual Assemblies on her initiative and with her encouragement. 

 The classes she led were devoted to discussion of the importance of teaching and the bounties derived from it, and study of 

The Advent of Divine       

 Justice. On the first day she presented notebooks and pens to those in attendance for use during the sessions. 'It was a memorable school and a truly joyous occasion,' reported one participant. 

 'Her participation,  in retrospect, was like a loving farewell gift from a beloved sister and devoted handmaiden of God.' 

 A memorial service held on 1 November at the National Hazfratu'1-Quds drew together many sorrowing friends who regretted her loss, praised her courage and devotion, and related many stories illustrating her generosity, lovingkindness and her profound knowledge of the Faith.

     ARDESETIR HEZARI           
(ARDISHIR HIZARI)          

 1885 — 1981 Ardishur Hiz~ri was born into a Zoroastrian family in Yazd, fran, in 1885. 

 His parents died when he was young, leaving behind one daughter and five sons, of whom Ardishir and Rashfd were twins. 

 Education was not universal in Persia a century ago so what little Ardishfr could scoop up locally was supplemented  by that passed on to him by an


<p777>
IN MEMORIAM                777

     Ardeshir Hezari           

  elder brother, Khud6d~d who also guided him to the Baha'i Faith. 

 In 1891 turbulent upheavals rocked Yazd and resulted in the martyrdom of seven Baha'is whose possessions were plundered. Ardishir who was about seven years old at the time was a witness to the martyrdom of one of this group of believers. He saw him savagely hacked to pieces and the mangled body dragged through the streets while the bystanders pelted it with sticks and stones. Asked about the reason for such monstrous conduct Khud~d~d told Ardi4hfr about the Cause of Baha'u'llah, gradually drawing his young brother towards the Faith. Through meetings with the elder Afn~n, I±ijf Mirza Muhammad-Taqf, Ardishir became confirmed and declared his belief in the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. 

 From then on Ardishir joined Khudad~d in his teaching  work, and always they used tact and wisdom so as not to arouse antagonism among fanatical elements. 

 Teaching was the dominant passion of Ardishir's life. While he was working in SWr~z he would take enquirers to a prominent Baha'i of that city who had a room adjoining his business premises, ostensibly for his siesta, but actually for use as a meeting-place by seekers and teachers of the Cause. Such was Arclishir's zeal that one day he sought to convert two outstanding Baha teachers he met there whom he mistook for Muslims. These two youths were Tar~zu'11~h Saman-dan  and 'AIf-Akbar Rafsanj~nf. Tar4zu'116h Samandarf, elevated by Shoghi Effendi on 24 December 1951 to the rank of Hand of the Cause, often mentioned this meeting in later years and jokingly accounted Ardishir as his 'teacher'. 

 The bonds of friendship forged that day strengthened with the passing of the years. 

 Ardishir had the bounty of making pilgrimages to the Holy Land — once during the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha and twice during the ministry of 

Shoghi Effendi. Tablets   

 he received from the Master attest the sincerity of his purpose and his devotion to the Cause. 

 After being employed for several years Ardishir decided to start his own business with his brother Rashfd as a partner. 

 In their desire to carry out the beloved Guardian's wishes, they decided that Ardishir would remain in Qazvin to run the business and thus provide funds for Rashid and his family to pioneer. For the next five years their lives followed this pattern and Ardishir's participation in the activities of the Cause in Qazvin brought him great joy. Then his wife fell ill and, as her malady was incurable, she expressed a wish to die at a pioneer post and realize an ambition which fate had denied her during her life. Ardishfr took her to Ankara in Turkey where his daughter and son-in-law had pioneered and where she died four months later and was buried in a plot of land donated to the Baha'i community by Ardishfr for use as a burial-ground.  In spite of advanced age, Arclishfr travelled to different towns in Turkey to encourage the friends to pioneer and teach and bring up their children according to Baha'i standards. When the Turkish believers were unjustly accused and imprisoned, Ar-dishir  suffered along with them. The persecution resulted in wide publicity for the Cause and the eventual vindication of the friends and their release from captivity. 

 Later Ardishfr pioneered to Ludwigsburg, Germany, with his son-in-law and family, and thence to Mannheim where he died on 26 October 1981. On hearing of his death the Universal House of Justice, on 27 October,

 19084981 Vera was born on 26 December 1908 in Grenville, St. Andrew's, Grenada. In 1957, accompanied by her aunt, Millicent Douglas, she took an excursion cruise to Africa and arrived in Monrovia, Liberia, in December of that year. 

 Her aunt had known Julius Edwards prior to his moving in 1953 from Jamaica to Africa where he settled first in Ghana and then in Liberia. For his services in opening to the Faith the Northern Territories

 Hermione Vera Keens-Douglas
Edwards                    
he was named by Shoghi     

Effendi a Knight of Baha'u'llah.

 Vera and her aunt began attending  Mr. Edwards's public meetings in Monrovia and both accepted the Baha Faith in the spring of 1958. They and Mr. Edwards were elected to serve on the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Monrovia at Ridvan 1958. 

         Throughout the Ten Year    

 Crusade Vera was a very active teacher of the Faith. She, her aunt and Julius Edwards formed a teaching team and travelled to villages throughout Liberia. 

 Vera Keens-Douglas and Julius Edwards were married in November 1960. Vera became a naturalized Liberian and always considered herself a Liberian Baha'i. 

     At Ridvan 1964 the Hand    

 of the Cause John Robarts appointed Vera a member of the Auxiliary Board. 

 That year she represented the Hands of the Cause at the first National Convention of Liberia. She was the representative  of the Continental Board of 

Counsellors for Africa     

 at several National Conventions —  Libera, Ghana and Gambia — and also at several important conferences in those countries as well as the Ivory Coast. 

 For many years, and before the presentday emphasis on the siBiritual education of children, Vera singlehandedly organized and taught children's classes. From 1964 until 1979 she composed monthly Feast Letters for distribution among the believers in Gambia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Ghana, Nigeria and Mali. She attended the first Youth Conference of Ivory Coast in 1967 and addressed the West 

African Baha'i Women's     

 Conference held at the University of Liberia in December 1978. 

     Julius and Vera Edwards    

 left Liberia on 20 December 1979 and arrived in Grenada on 

28 February 1980. She      

 continued to be an active teacher of the Faith until her death on 

19 November 1981. She      

 bequeathed a small plot of land at Grenville, St. Andrew's, to the Baha'i community of Grenada for an endowment. 

 In a written tribute to Vera Edwards, Mrs. Nura Master stated: 'She was a lady of grace, understanding and strong character whose dignity and manner quickly attracted those who came into contact with her. Through her trips, her very inspiring Feast Letters and through personal correspondence and contacts she tried tirelessly to attain and demonstrate

 for those who are honoured to discharge  this sacred duty Her dissatisfaction always came from what had not been done in complete conformity with the Divine teachings.' 

 Vera was a kind, patient, gentle person who was deeply involved in teaching the Faith on the local level during the time she spent in Grenada; she was much loved by her Baha'i and other associates.

      ABDUL-MISSAGH (ABDOLMJSSAG}-I) MISSAGHIYEH
    ('ABDU'L-MITHAQ MITHAQiYJH)

 1890 — 1981 Mirza Ily6s (Elias), later called 'Abdu'1-Missagh 

Missaghiyeh ('Abdu'1-Mithaq

 Mftha-qiyih),  was the grandson of Hakim Htir6n, a wellknown Jewish scholar and physician of K6sh6n, central fr6n, most of whose descendants  became Baha'is and raised large and prominent families. 

 One of his daughters, JahAn, married Mirza Yah6dd, an esteemed Baha'i of K~shhn, who was also of Jewish background. 

 Although Jah6n was a fierce opponent of the Baha'i Faith at tile time of her marriage and for some time later, she embraced the Cause of the Blessed Beauty and became a devoted servant as a result of a dream in which she saw Baha'u'llah. 

 Six children were born of the union of Mirza Yahuid6 and Jah6n. IlyAs was the eldest son. 

        When L1y~s ('Abdu'1-Mithaq

 Mithaqfyih) was twelve years old he wrote a poem of eighty verses which he sent to 'Abdu'l-Baha. The poem was both an urgent appeal to the people of the Holy Land to recognize their Lord and a confession of faith of a Baha'i child supplicating the Master to take him under His protection and to hear his wish for sacrifice. 

 In response, 'Abdu'l-Baha adV V 

Abdul-Missagh Missaghiyeh 

  dressed a beautiful Tablet to the boy, alluding to him in the salutation as an eloquent and brilliant poet. In the same year I1y~s's father was attacked by enemies of the Faith who struck him with shovels. 

 Wounded on the head, he passed away at the age of forty years, having been in a state of semiconsciousness for some months. J1y~s thus became the head of the family, and left KAsh6n, his native city, to seek employment in a business in Hamad~n. He went later to Raslit in the north of Ir6n, to direct a branch of a business belonging to KhAjih Rabbi' Muttahidih, an esteemed Baha'i of K6sh6n and became the secretary of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly of Rasht. Some   

 time later he was entrusted with a business mission in Kirm6nsh6h a city whose population was bitterly opposed to the Faith. 

 He was expelled from that town and replaced by Mirza Ya'qiib Muttahidih Kh6-jih's  brother, who was later martyred in Kirm6nsh6h thus becoming the first Baha'i martyr of Jewish origin. 

 Mirza I1y~s was a selftaught man. Forced to work from childhood, he had no opportumty to obtain a higher education. However, his gift for poetry was sustained by a good knowledge of Persian and Arabic. 
The teach


<p780>

  ing trips that he undertook in company with the great teacher, Mr. Milidi Akhav6n-i Saffi enabled him to widen his knowledge of the Teachings and to gain skill in the art of presenting them. During the meetings he lifted the hearts of the participants by reading and chanting Tablets and prayers in his beautiful clear voice. 

 In 1912, when he was twenty-two years old, he was finally able to fulfil his dearest wish, that of making his pilgrimage and attaining the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha He was again privileged to go on pilgrimage towards the end of 1919, spending forty-five unforgettable days in the Holy Land and being frequently in the company of the Master. 

 During that sojourn, an account of which Mirza Ily6s wrote in verse, 'Abdu'l-Baha on several occasions  demonstrated the esteem in which He held him. It seemed to the delighted pilgrim that the Master fulfilled, one by one, his hidden wishes without their having to be expressed: while strolling in the garden surrounding  the Shrine of the Bab he received from the hand of Shoghi Effendi a Tablet revealed specially for Mirza Ily6s by 'Abdu'l-Baha;  he was photographed with the Master and other members of the Holy Family; and he was summoned by the Master who invited him to be seated while He dictated to His secretary a Tablet in which He bestowed upon the awestruck pilgrim the name 'Missaghi-yeh' (Mfthaqiyih), or 'firmness'. 

 Henceforth he adopted as his first name 'Abdul-Missagh' ('Abdu'1-Mfthaq), or 'servant of the Covenant'. 

 Thus he indicated his humble dedication to the Master Who was the Centre of the Covenant. Yet another wish was fulfilled during this pilgrimage: Abdul-Missagh was entrusted with a mission by his Beloved, that of returning to I r~n via Egypt and India and placing into the hands of their recipients the Tablets addressed to them by 'Abdu'l-Baha and which were eagerly awaited following the break in communications caused by the first World War. 

 One can easily guess what ineffable  joy flooded his being as a result of having received so many honours and favours from the beloved Master! Nor had the bounties ceased: before his departure 'Abdu'l-Baha gave him a gold coin which was to become, in Abdul-Missagh's mind, the symbolic basis of his personal capital. 

 In Ir6n he continued to work tirelessly in service to the Faith and the friends. He married Maryam Kh6num a charitable and generous lady, who was the daughter of KhAjih Rabbi', and from this union one daughter and three sons were born. 

 He settled in Tihr~n and worked in real estate. 

 His business  became very successful and prosperous and soon he became widely known and highly respected throughout the community as a businessman. Those who worked for him or had dealings with him also appeared to attract prosperity to their affairs. Abdul-Missagh attributed this success to the coin he had received from the hands of 'Abdu'l-Baha. However, his professional activities did not prevent him from serving the Faith. He was elected several times to membership on the National Spiritual Assembly, and the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihr~n, and he served onvarious committees. In about 1940 he built the hospital that he offered to the Baha community of I r~n.1 

 Until the end of his life he contributed to the development and enlargement of the Missaghiyeh Hospital and Maternity Clinic, one of the most important and best equipped in the 

Iranian capital. Soon a    

 school for nurses and later a home for the aged were created as auxiliaries of the hospital. These institutions to which persons of all backgrounds were admitted, sometimes free of charge, were 'silent teachers', the only BahA'f-operated service institutions with which Iranians of all religions had a relationship. 

 Abdul-Missagh took a deep personal intere~t in the hospital and his generosity made it unnecessary for appeals to be made for the purchase of flew equipment or to meet. deficits in the operating costs. 
  During the ministry of     

Shoghi Effendi, Abdul-Missagh

 was privileged to make pilgrimages  in 1927 and 1952. During his second pilgrimage he fell ill as soon as he arrived in Haifa. The beloved Guardian himself came to visit him. Moved by this great honour, Abdul-Missagh  recited these verses: 'If it is you who, as a compassionate physician, comes to my bedside, I would not give to anyone the pleasure of being ill!' On the occasion of his second pilgrimage the Guardian entrusted him with the n\ission of transferring the 1 See Irdn, pers&udon des Baha'is: un livre blanc (Paris:

  enough to catch a ring which the beloved Guardian had cast into the midst of a group of joyously vying Baha'i youth who had gathered in a green field. In a letter written on the Guardian's behalf by his secretary on 21 

June 1944, Shoghi Effendi  

 praised HPshang's services, assured him of great success in his teaching efforts, and encouraged him to 'remain  steadfast in order to win the prize and achieve brilliant 

Victories'.                

 Zhin6s received her formal education in Tihr~n, excelling as a student throughout her school years. She received her B.Sc. and M.Sc. in physics from TihrAn University, specializing in atmospheric sciences and meteorology and graduating with honours at the top of her class. 

 She started her career at age twenty-three as the first woman meteorologist of Iran. By this time she had two small children, Later she served as the head of the Atmospheric and Climate Research Department of IrAn and finally was appointed as Director-General of the country's Department of Meteorology. She was at the same time President of the Iranian School of Meteorology, a school that was founded through her efforts in order to make IThn self-sufficient in training meteorologists. 

 She also taught at Tihr6n University. It is significant to observe that in the 1950s when Zhfrnis began her career the science of meteorology in mm was in its infancy; no research or development took place and the country did not even have a Department of Meteorology. It was largely through the dedicated and ceaseless work of Zhirnis over a period of twenty-five years that IrAn's Department of Meteorology was founded and began to take a leading role in this area of endeavour in the Middle East. She devoted fifteen years to researching kin's physical geography and its relationship to industrial and agricultural activities, a study which led to publication of her monumental work Geographical Atlas of Irdn which became an indispensable tool in the planning of industrial and economic development projects.  She was also the first Iranian to conduct  research into the potential use of solar energy and often represented her country at international conferences on climatology and meteorology where she presented papers on various subjects including air pollution. 

 The leading scientist in her field in frdn, Zhfnhs was recognized and admired throughout the government for her contributions~ to that field and for her high degree of personal integrity. 

 She was much loved and respected by her subordinates who observed her humanity and selfless service and who competed with one another in serving her, and by many foreign scientists who worked with her during her tenure in the government. To these visitors she came to represent, through her exceptional intellectual and moral qualities, a hope for the advancement of Irfln. Among the many honours conferred upon her was the Royal Medal of Iran. She also served on various humanitarian organizations including the 

Women's Liberation Organization

 and the Zonta Club and sewed as head of the 

Dayhfm Peace Committee.    

 To appreciate her professional achievements  and her contribution to her country it is important to consider the odds against which she was working, given the existing conditions and standards of fran, and to recognize the obstacles she faced as a woman with no 'connections' and as a Baha'i with impeccable moral standards. 

 Only her intellectual abilities,  perseverance, sincerity of motive and, above all, her strong conviction that as a Baha she had an obligation to contribute towards the advancement of her nation, enabled  her to meet and overcome the obstacles confronting her. 

 In the 1970s when she became eligible for retirement Zhfn6s yearned to devote all her time and energy to the service of the Faith but her attempts to retire were blocked by the authorities who considered her services indispensable  to the welfare of the country. 

 And so she stayed on only to be dismissed later by the Revolutionary Government for being a Baki'f. She was denied a pension and her bank accounts were seized. 

 Zifirnis's professional activities at no time interfered with her active service to the Faith or her role as a mother. She was an active member of the Baha community of Tihr~n from her youth and served on numerous committees including the Committee for the Advancement  of Women. She and her husband spent the year 1955 in Kirmdn as pioneers, returning in 1956 to Tihr&n. In 1961 they settled with their three ~ma11 children in NArmak, a small town with a fanatical popu

  lation situated on the eastern outskirts of Tihnin. 

 Here their home became a centre of Baha'i activities and they became pillars of strength to the newly-established 

Baha'i community.  They   

 both served on the Local Spiritual  Assembly of N6rmak for five years, during which time they commuted daily to work in Tihr6n. 

 They left behind a strong and active Baha'i community and returned to Tihr6n in 1967. Zhin6s was elected to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihran and served as its secretary until 1971 when they moved westward with their son and settled in a newly-built, deeply religious town named Gawhar-Dasht. 

Soon the Local Spiritual   

 Assembly  was formed, This community, vitM and active and filled with spirit, subsequently became a target for the enemies of the Cause. At least five of its original Local Assembly members were martyred in the period 1980 —  1982, a large number of Baha'i families were forced to leave and still more were imprisoned. Until it was confiscated in 1981 the home of Zhiniis and lliishang in Gawhar-Dasht continued  to be of use to the Faith by serving as a shelter for Baki'i refugees. 

 In 1977, the last year during which their lives were to be normal Zhirnis was appointed an Auxiliary Board member serving Tihran, Hamad6n and the western region of IrAn. 

 In 1978 the situation of the Baha'is began to deteriorate. 

 Hiishang was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly and the couple's combined responsibilities demanded their full-time presence in Tihr4n. They rented an apartment in the city where they spent most of their nights. 

 Later, as the situation worsened, even the luxury of a semipermanent homq was denied them and for security reasons they spent every night in a different place. The only permanent features of their lives at this point were their agonies and hardships and a small suitcase which they carried with them everywhere and which contained the necessary  personal items for prison. 

 In 1980, after the imprisonment of the Counsellor, Dr. 

Masih Farhangi, Zhirnis    

 accepted  many of his duties and also attended most of the meetings of the 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 When she and Hiishang parted on the morning of 21 August 1980 they did not know that they would never see one another again in this life. That evening while in their meeting the members of the National Spiritual Assembly and two Auxiliary Board members were abducted by the revolutionary guards and were never heard from again. Zhin6s was to have been present at this meeting but for personal reasons did not attend and thus was, momentarily, spared. To the distress caused by the implications for the Baha'i community of Iran of the arrest of the National Assembly was now added the agony of separation from her husband of thirty-three years. 

 Zhirnis endured her suffering with characteristic calm and continued her work. 'I do not permit myself anything but calm and laughter with the friends,' she wrote to her family in January. 

 'Missing you and anxiety affects me, and just then the phone may ring and my voice may not be reassuring enough Zhirnis was elected to the next National Spiritual Assembly but retained her appointive  offices as well. She served the Baha'i community of frdn in these capacities until her arrest on 13 December 1981 following which no family member was permitted to see her. She was executed on 27 December 1981 together with seven other members of the National Assembly and buried in a common grave in a section of the Tiliran cemetery reserved for infidels. A cellmate has reported that when Zbfrnis was informed by the revolutionary guards that she was to be transferred to Evin prison she exclaimed, 'I shall be very happy to make a pilgrimage to Evin prison where so many Baha have been martyred!' In a letter to her family written in June 1981 Zhfrnis had remarked, 'I only want you to know that I lack nothing. There is no sorrow — absolutely no difficulties. 

 I am content, well, fortunate, assured, serene, full of energy and thankful. 

 Whatever should happen, there could be nothing better A major contribution of Zhiniis was the role-model she provided for women both within and without the Faith in illustrating in her own life the fine balance that may be achieved between spirit and intellect. 

 She exemplified this balance through her nobility of character and her professional accomplishments.  She was frequently in the public eye, interviewed on national television and interviewed  by journalists as a 'pioneer' woman. Within the Baha community, through her services as a teacher of Sunday School for

  over two decades and her service on women's committees, she touched countless lives and gave inspiration and a vision of their potential to rising generations of Baha'i women. 

 Zhin6s, cut down in her fifty-second year, left behind three children, her aged mother, a brother and sister, who pray to be worthy of her sacrifice.

 SHIDRUKH AM{R-K{YA BAQA    

 1935 — 1982  

Shfdrukh Amfr-Kfy~ Baq~    
came of valiant stock.     

 A paternal grandfather, HAji Ddw6d MitMqfy~in, a prominent member of the Jewish community of K~sh~n, while still young accepted the Cause in that city and went on foot to the Holy Land to attain the Master's presence. 'Abdu'l-Baha referred to him in a Tablet as 'Affectionate'. Later on, with his wife and some of his children, he Shidrukh Am(r-K(yd Baqd pioneered for about twenty years in Palma, Spain, and was privileged to buy a plot of land in Madrid for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 Another forebear, on the father's side, Mirza H6shim also embraced the Cause in K~shTh at a time when the friends were being persecuted. 

 He arose in their defence and protested to the Governor against the injustice and oppression, and was promptly locked up in prison himself. However, his wit and eloquence won him liberty. The Master addressed  him as 'Zealous'. 

 A maternal grandfather, H~jf DAwiid Iqr6ri, of K6sh6n, accepted the Faith when young. His father and brother, too, had embraced the Cause but none knew of the others' belief until they met at a Baha'i meeting. 

 Thereafter,  they worked together in service to the Faith, entertaining the friends and guiding seekers to the Truth. They bought the impressive  house of a high-ranking official with a view to holding befitting meetings therein to teach the Faith and, in this, they attained to their heart's desire. 

 At one of these meetings they hoisted in front of the house a banner bearing the inscription Yd Bahd'u'l-Abhd, inviting friend and stranger to enter. The Master said they were hospitable and of noble aim and that He was well pleased with them. 

 Shidrukh, a granddaughter of these veterans,  was born in Tihrhn on 8 October 1935, the eldest daughter of R61~u'116h Mfthdqfy~n and RuMniyyih Iqr6rf, both faithful servants of the Faith. Shidrukh had three sisters and one brother and from an early age was deeply attached to the Cause and its institutions. 

 She was fond of music and took piano lessons at school. She had a charming voice and was the first person in fr6n to record a prayer, revealed by our beloved Guardian, to the accompaniment of the piano. It wa,s highly approved by the Hands of the Cause and was played in many continental conferences and large Baha'i gatherings in I ran. For a time she was on the national tdevision network demonstrating cooking and other domestic courses. 

 She knew English and was well-versed  in some arts. At age sixteen Shidrukh was married to Mani~chiln Baq(i; one daughter and two sons were born of the union. 

 A visit to the Holy Land as a pilgrim reinvigorated her faith; she attended the International Conferences held in London,


<p785>
785

                     IN MEMORIAM

  Palermo, Alaska, Paris and Brazil and had vivid recollections of them all. 

 While in the United States, two years ago, for her daughter's wedding, her children and 'sisters urged her not to return to I nin where her life would be in danger, but she disregarded their plea. 'When our beloved Guardian exhorted us to pioneer,' she told them, 'we did not heed his call; we let ourselves down. Now that the Universal House of Justice bids us maintain our posts, will we desert them and fail a second time? Not I! I feel I am needed in lrTh and return there to do what lies in my power, regardless of the consequences.' When the hour for departure arrived, she was overcome with emotion. She opened her prayer book and read prayers which brought solace to her heart and the strength and courage to continue on her course to her destined fate and eternal glory. 

 Though fr6n was agitated and distress was rife, she stood firm as a rock, bringing the friends together in devotional meetings and restoring cAm and tranquillity to their disturbed  hearts. She was ever ready to serve and was appointed on various committees. She was put in charge of organizing the Nineteen Day Feasts held in her district. 

 This took up most of her evenings. She spoke to the friends of the need for steadfastness, courage and sacrifice in the path of the Beloved, conveyed to them the messages of the National Spiritual Assembly, and inspired them to be firm. Whenever news came of a martyrdom or some other affliction engulfing the Baha'is, she would expatiate on the glory of sacrifice, the station of the martyrs and the lustre which their deeds would shed on the pages of history. 

 The steadily mounting wave of oppression instigated by the authorities with a view to casting terror into the hearts of the believers, dampening their zeal and thus weakening the institutions of the Faith, was putting a heavy strain on the faith of some of the friends. 
At such a time of stress.  

 Shidrukh did not flinch or falter. With the utmost courage, she arranged meetings. at her own home or at the homes of her sister or children who were all abroad. She attended to the bereaved families of the martyrs and offered them comfort and shelter. One of these was a Baha'i woman from Yazd whom she lodged in her sister's home. 

 Shfdrukh was always very cautious in arranging Baha'i meetings, and if she suspected any leak threatening the safety of a proposed meeting, she promptly switched it to the house of her sister or children. In spite of all her precautions, however, there came a night — Monday, 2 November 1981 — when, at the hour of nine, there was a knock on her door. 

The Local Spiritual Assembly

 of Tihr~n was in session at her home. She approached the door and asked who was knocking. The Baha'i woman from Yazd answered, and recognizing her voice_Shfdrukh was reassured and opened the door. To her dismay, she found that the Baha'i woman was not alone; armed guards of the Islamic Revolutionary Party accompanied her. What had transpired was this: at the home of Shfdrukh's sister was also a Muslim lodger, addicted to drugs, who made himself a nuisance to the neighbourhood. 

 Shfdrukh had consulted the Local Spiritual Assembly about the advisability of evicting him on the ground of his failure to pay the rent but was asked to refrain from taking any action for the moment. 

 It appears, however, that some of the neighbours had lodged a complaint against the man and the guards had come to investigate. 

 They asked where the owner of the house was and the Baha'i woman from Yazd, being simple, led them to Shfdrukh. 

 The guards asked the six Assembly members  in session. 

 Shfdrukh her husband, the woman from Yazd and another Baha'i (Fir-dawsi's son), there present, to accompany them. Aware that the National Spiritual Assembly members who had been asked to accompany a similar squad of guards had never been seen again, Shidrukh insisted that she would accompany them only to the police station situate in the same street. The wrangle attracted the neighbours, and faced with a not too friendly crowd, the guards complied with Shidrukh's wish. 

 Once at the police station, however, the guards transported their captives  to a prison. 

 After some ten days, Firdawsi's son and the woman from Yazd were released, and the rest transferred to another jail noted for its severe discipline and the oppression inflicted by its warders. 

 The following accQunt is based on reports


<p786>
786                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  by fellow prisoners, Baha'i and non-Bah&f, and Shfdrukh's relatives who were witness to these incidents. 

 Time and again, the Revolutionary Committee  put pressure upon her to recant her faith, holding out freedom as the reward. It was a serious life-and-death game, not a mock one. A letter to her sister a week before related her encounter with the authorities when she approached them on behalf of herself, her sisters and brother to clear up the matter of their inheritance from their father. 'What is your religion?' the President of the Court had asked, and she had replied that she was a Baha'i. 'If you desire prosperity,' he had suggested, 'you had better recant your faith or else you will experience serious loss.' 'Did you not hear,' she answered, 'what the old Baha in Yazd said when such a proposition was put to him, that man of eighty summers whose head was repeatedly dashed to the ground to persuade him to comply with your demand? Did he not say: "What! Should I surrender my faith to secure some baubles?" I, too, tell you that I can do without my inheritance, if necessary.' 

 The President said, 'You represent  others who may not be of the same mind as you.' She replied, 'They are Baha'is, too, and none of them will barter the eternal world for this transitory one.' 

 Having said this, she arose and, without waiting for permission  from the Court, departed, leaving the President fuming with rage at his failure to turn her from her faith. 

 Shfdrukh had for long prior to these events been engaged in committing to memory prayers and Tablets and passages from the Holy Writings. 

 This she did in anticipation of the day when she might be confined somewhere without access to Baha literature. Now, in prison, she could reap the reward of her foresight and draw on her memory for those priceless gems that were to delight, sustain and strengthen her. 

 Several times they told her that she could secure her freedom just by signing a paper. This was ostensibly to the effect that she would not participate any longer in any Baha administrative activities, but she knew in reality it was a ruse on the part of the authorities; if secured, that document would be given wide publicity as evidence of her recantation in an effort to demoralize the friends, weaken their resolve and undermine the institutions of the Faith. 

 While she was in jail, the authorities confiscated her property as well as that belonging to her deceased parents, her sisters, her brother and her children who were all abroad and whom she represented legally. 

 During one of the interrogations Shidrukh came face to face with her husband who also was in prison. 

 He told her that he had signed the paper presented to him and was to be freed. 

 'For the sake of our children,' he said, 'you, too, sign it and secure your freedom.' She pressed his hand and merely said, 

'Steadfastness!  Steadfastness!'

 and was sorrowful, wondering what contrivance had brought about his defection. 

 According to her sister Shfdrukh was permitted to make one short telephone call to her relatives a few days prior to her martyrdom. She told them not to be concerned about her. 

 A non-B ahA'f who was immured for three days with that group said, on release, how the morale of them all had been sustained by the courageous spirit and uplifting words of SliM-rukh  — 'With such faith and steadfastness and zeal animating her, you should have no fear for her,' we were assured. 

   On 4 January 1982 Shidrukh 

 and the six members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihr6n were secretly executed, this information being obtained fortuitously by their relatives and friends. No will or document exists to attest to her martyrdom although it was reported that she and the members of the Local Spiritual Assembly had decided to write their wills. 

 The authorities were not prepared to deliver her body and, later, a demand seems to have been made for five hundred thousand tUmtns [in excess of $50,000 U.S.] apiece for every will they would hand over. Since their wishes and intentions were known and their deeds and words were testimony to the unity, the greatness and glory of God, there was nothing further that could be gleaned from their wills. It is said that all these prisoners were buried unwashed, in the clothes they were wearing, and without any funeral rites, in a common grave. 

 As far as is known Shidrukh is the first Baha'i woman of Jewish extraction to lay down her life for the Faith. A year pTior to her martyrdom, she requested the prayers of the

Universal House of Justice 

 for steadfastness in the Faith for herself and her sisters and brother, and for the progress of her father's soul in the realms above. She withstood all tests and trials and never faltered until she attained the glorious station of martyrdom. She advanced with arms extended wide to embrace the darts of sacrifice and gave her life joyously for her belief. Her daughter and two sons, her three sisters and brother, all firm and active in the Faith, endure this tragic blow confident that the precious blood so willingly shed on fran's soil for the Love of the Glory of God will not be in vain and that every drop will raise a thousand lovers to serve the Cause of God and His people. 

 Shfdrukh was a loving mother, an affectionate sister, a trustworthy companion, a faithful mate, a generous hostess, a true Baha'i.

        APPU RAMAN                 

 1921 — 1982 Appu Raman was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 21 December 1921 and came to Malaya in 1928. 

 It has been said of him that he seemed to have been born with a burning desire to serve humanity. His association with the Ministry of Welfare Services began in 

        Appu Raman                 

  1946 and he continued his dedicated services to the poor and needy through this Department  until his retirement in 1976, during which time he held many important posts and initiated a number of societies including the Self-Reliant Society, the Association for the Physically 

Handicapped, the Association

 for the Mentally Retarded and a host of others. 

 His Baha life began in 1962. He accepted the 

Faith through Mrs. Theresa 

 Chee. On that auspicious occasion, when asked what his life ambition was, not having anything in particular to say, he pointed to a picture of the Baha'i Temple in Wilmette and said, 'Perhaps all I want is to visit that Temple!' He was granted the bounty of visiting the Mother Temple of the West three times and of visiting the Holy Places in fr6n, as well. In 1965 he was elected a member of the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Malaysia       

 and continued to serve on that body until 1972 in which year he was elected chairman. In the early years of the Faith in Malaysia he was instrumental in establishing the national Hazfratu'1-Quds. In his teaching work he was recognized as a scholar of Hinduism and was popular among the Tamil believers because of his eloquence and his depth of knowledge of both their

  language and culture. In his final years he became actively involved in the 

Ulu Langat Local Spiritual 

 Assembly and the project assigned to it by the National Spiritual Assembly, that of developing the Balakong Summer School land. 

    In late December 1981 Mr.  

 Raman started off on a four-month teaching trip which was to take him to Thailand, Burma, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka but he ascended to the Abh6 Kingdom on 5 January 1982 at Rangoon, Burma. His sudden death came as a shock to the Malaysian community and his loss was felt equally keenly by the believers in Burma who had grown close to his radiant personality. 

 More than five hundred friends from all parts of Burma gathered at the funeral. 

The National Spiritual     

 Assembly of Burma reported that the Faith had not been so well proclaimed in that land since the days of the Hand of the 

Cause of God Mustafh Rdmf. 

 As the two rows of Burmese friends, with tears in their eyes, carried Mr. Raman's body from the hearse to the grave, they realized that through him a permanent bond had been established between the communities of the Greatest Name in 

Burma and Malaysia. The    
energy he devoted to the   

Faith                      

 •and his obedience to its principles, laws and ordinances are but small examples of the love he had for 

Baha'u'llah. May the Blessed Beauty

 accept his loyal services at His Holy Threshold. 

 Mr. Raman leaves behind his wife, Mrs. Thanapakian Raman, and five children. 

   On 8 January 1982 the Universal

 House of Justice caNed the National Spiritual Assembly  of Burma expressing the hope that the example of this DEVOTED SERVANT would inspire  the beloved friends in that country to INTENSIFY THEIR RESOLVE in service to the Faith. 

 The friends in Malaysia received the following cable:

 FLORENCE ELIZABETH ALTASS  

 1884 — 1982  

Florence Elizabeth Altass  

 was born on 13 May 1884 at Aldeburgh in Suffolk, England, and was one of a family of nine children. 

 Slight in build and small in stature, she had an irresistible  charisma. 

 She was blessed with amazing perception of others' needs and she literally sparkled her way through life until the very day she passed on to the AbM Kingdom on 22 January 1982, at nearly ninety-eight years of age. 

 Florence's upbringing was strictly Catholic but she never felt that that was where she 'belonged'. During her teens she travelled to Edinburgh to stay with a school friend, Kathleen Flemming. She attended her first Baha meeting with Kathleen and immediately identified  with the Baha'i ideals. Although she attended Baha'i gatherings subsequently and always considered herself a Baha'i, she did not formally declare her belief in written form until many years later. Having broken away from the Catholic Faith and the authoritarian upbringing of her mother, she feared that by signing a declaration of belief she would in some obscure sense limit herself; yet as early

                     IN MEMORIAM

  as her twenty-first year when she left home for good and enrolled for nursing training she identified herself as a Baha'i on the application form and throughout her life associated with the Baha'i community. 

 As a young girl Florence longed to become a missionary. 

 To fulfil this dream she felt that she must take up nursing and that the more difficult aspects of this field would best prepare  her. She persuaded a friend of her father's, a doctor, to assist her. 

 She completed a course thtit covered caring for mental patients and maternity cases, the latter at a London hospital where prostitutes, indigents and the homeless were treated. Here florence's compassion and love for her fellow-kind  expanded to an extent she had not dreamed of: the cases she described made one's heart ache for the plight of humdnity. Slowly her aspirations towards the missionary field changed. 

 She concluded her training with a three-year general course at the London Middlesex 

Hospital.                  

 Her first assignment was to the Austrian Imperial court of the House of Habsburg to nurse a lady-in-waiting. 

 Florence was well liked by the Archduke Franz-Ferdinand and the Archduchess and she became very fond of them. The sympathy she felt with them as strict 

Catholics enabled Florence 

 to express many of her 'Baha'i ideas'. She did not approve of the crucifixes in every room, and declared 'The God I pray to is a living God, not a dead Christ on a cross. When she left his service the Archduke presented her with a rosary of carnelian which had at the end, in place of a crucifix, a medallion inscribed with the date, and a madonna and child. 

     From Austria Florence      

 travelled to Budapest where she tried to learn more about her father's family, who were Austrian. 

 (In later years Florence was one of the first Western women to cross Russia on the Trans-Siberian Railway, and in 1917 she returned from there when the fall of the Czar was imminent.) Meanwhile she returned to the United Kingdom  and, as always, she felt drawn to Scotland where she attended Baha'i meetings at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Alexander Whyte. Dr. Whyte was a prominent minister of the United Free Church of Scotland. The manse at 7 Charlotte Square, the home of Dr. and Mrs. Whyte, was attached to St. George's United Free Church which is now known as West Register House. 'Abdu'l-Baha was invited  to Edinburgh by the Whytes during the course of His visit to the West and remained in that city from 6 to 10 January 1913. During this sojourn Florence had the bounty of meeting 'Abdu'l-Baha at the Whyte's home, although she was not aware that He was to be present. In a recorded interview in later years she recalled, 'Of course when I saw Him I knew who He was. Oh, you couldn't mistake Him. And that heavenly smile! It was a perpetual smile, and yet it wasn't, if you can imagine; it looked as though He smiled at everyone, and yet the smile seemed always to be there. And His eyes looked as if they were looking through you. He had the most gentle voice; I've never heard a voice like it. I would like to hear it again. He embraced a good many people; He didn't me, He just shook hands. 

 Several of us He just shook hands with.' Florence wrote of that meeting: 'When 'Abdu'l-Baha shook hands with me, He seemed to transmit something to me, and I've never been the same since. 

 "Asked if He spoke in English at all, Florence laughingly replied, 'No. 

 There was an interpreter — who spoilt the whole show! It wasn't that his voice didn't suit me, it was that although 'Abdu'l-Baha spoke in Persian, you understood; you knew what He was saying, somehow. 

 One was so enamoured of His voice that one sort of felt what He was saying. 

 It was as though He delivered His address in English, although He spoke Persian.' 

 So great was the throng seeking admittance to the presence of the Master that Florence refrained from attending subsequent meetings though she was strongly drawn to do so and regretted to the end of her days the loss occasioned by her extraordinary courtesy and consideration for others. Her one meeting with 'Abdu'l-Baha formed the theme of many of her poems which she continued to write till the end of her life.2 

 Ever after having met the Master, Florence felt His presence and inspiration. 

 She asked that she should be a 'channel for healing'. Before treating a patient she always prayed and seemed inspired with 'the right means'. In spite of her orthodox medical training, 1  See U.K. Baha'i Journal, February/March 1967, for a fuller account of this meeting. 

 2 See The Baha'i World, vol. XVII, p. 650.


<p790>
790                 THE HAHA'i WORLD

  Florence (a vegetarian), held strong views about 'natural healing' and refused ever to administer drugs. Although she met with strong opposition in the orthodox field she persevered with her intuition which she felt came from an 'inner knowledge'. 

 She worked closely with a number of doctors of similar convictions and often recalled the numerous occasions on which patients, officially diagnosed  as hopeless cases, would come to them as a last resort and make seemingly miracu-bus  recoveries. 

 'Given the right conditions,' she explained simply, 'the body heals itself. Healing is on three planes — mental, spiritual and physical.' 

 Seriously ill oniy twice in her life, at the ages of seventy and ninety-five, Florence was always alert, vivacious and energetic, a living example of her convictions. 

 Florence was never in one place long and in moving around continually in her various nursing jobs she influenced the lives of many people. Even during the period when I knew her, beginning about 1974, she would not miss an opportunity to mention the Faith to those she met. She attracted into her confidence young and old alike. Numerous friends, Baha and not, sought her advice and she always responded with perception and deep wisdom. It was during one of her illnesses, when she was about seventy, that she finally affixed her name to a declaration card, though she professed  amazement at having done so when she saw herself listed as a declared believer in the Baha'i Journal; but once recovered and now 'declared' she found to her astonished delight that the step she had taken did not limit her. 'Now I know what it's really like to be limited,' she would remark during her last years when' her vision and hearing began to fail. 

 But these were merely physical limitations, and very different from those which her free spirit had feared. Her last ten years were spent in vegetarian homes in 1{orsham and then in Hastings where she was allowed to remain in spite of difficulties of vision and hearing which would normally have qualified her for residence in a nursing home. Florence never lost her valiant spirit of independence. Residents of the home marvelled at her versatility and activeness, and remarked that 'something was missing' whenever she was away. 

 She served on the Local Spiritual Assemblies of Horsham and Hastings and as the oniy English Baha'i in Hastings she often found herself with the responsibility of conveying  to enquirers the tenets of the Faith. Her presentation always made a profound impression on those who met her. 'Age has restricted my activities,' she wrote to a friend in 1981, 'but has not affected my love and devotion to the Faith or my gratitude for being allowed to meet the Master and to hear His voice, a voice like no other one would hear again.' 

 She was humorous to the end, mentioning in one of her letters that she would rejoice to be r~united with 'Abdu'l-Baha  in the spiritual realm but feared that she had been 'in queue so long He may have forgotten me'. 

 Three of Florence's life's ambitions were fulfilled in the years following her ninetieth birthday: sh~e made a pilgrimage to the Baha Shrines in the Holy Land in 1978; she found that her intuitive understanding of healing was confirmed in a number of the Master's Tablets published by the Universal House of Justice in 1978 under the title Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha; and her wish to see Baha'is in the medical field 'get together to share ideas' was realized in June 1980 when the. first International 

Baha'i Conference on Health

 and. Healing was held in Ottawa under the auspices of the Association for 

Baha'i Studies.' Unable    

 to attend, though she had hoped to, Florence submitted a paper which was well received. 

 Florence recorded in her poems and written fragments of prose her visionary thoughts and ideals. We are fortunate to have these, together  with the example of her dedicated life of service, as an inspiration for generations to come. The tribute accorded this unassuming believer by the Universal House of Justice in its cable of 1 February 1982 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United Kingdom would have astonished one who never felt worthy of the bounty of having gazed but once upon the face of the Centre of the Covenant:

  Nasru'llhh Maviddat, though humble and self effacing, was known to and loved and respected  by many throughout the Baha world. He was born in Tihrhn, fran, in 1897 and passed away in Adelaide, 

Australia, on 7 April     

 1982. lie lived every moment of his life for the Faith and in its service. His great-grandfather was a devoted BThf and both his parents were Baha'is. 

 As a child he diligently followed his studies to the highest level available at the time and was then appointed to teach at Tarbfyat Baha'i School. His thirst for knowledge  and his devotion to his work touched the hearts of his students and colleagues alike and won him many admirers. 

 Mr. Maviddat was among the first group of young Iranian students to be selected for technical training in the United States under a programme in which the Iranian government was collaborating wiih a major American industrial complex. On his way to America he broke his journey in Beirut in order to visit the Holy 

Shrines in Haifa. While   

 in the Holy Land he had the bounty of meeting the beloved Guardian. 

 The two years he spent in the United States provided an opportunity to participate in the activities of the American Baha'is and to enrich his experience in Baha'i administration. 

 On his return fro5 America his heart was filled with joy and gratitude on being able to visit Shoghi Effendi for the second time. 

 Back in his homeland he lived in TihrTh for several years and served the Faith tirelessly as a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly and many local and national committees. 

 In particular  he was appointed to a small committee formed for translating the Guardian's messages  received in the English language or other Baha'i materials in that tongue. In addition he taught at Summer Schools, conducted  classes for youth and became a speaker and teacher of the Faith. 

 In 1956 he pioneered to the south of France where he quickly perfected his knowledge of French and participated in the activities of the friends of that region. When Shoghi Effendi passed away he began the difficult task of translating God 

Passes By from English    

 to Persian. He worked arduously on that book for several years, seeking to be faithful both to the style of Shoghi Effendi's own writings in Persian and to the words and expressions used in the Baha'i Writings. 

 That he successfully achieved his purpose to a very great extent is attested by many. His deep knowledge of Baha'i literature was a considerable aid in identifying and locating original Persian texts for the numerous quotations Shoghi Effendi used from the three Central Figures. 

 He thus avoided, apart from a few exceptions, retrans-lation  of the original passages to 

Persian.                  
    In 1968 Mr. Maviddat      

 was asked by the Universal House of Justice to help with the work at the World Centre where he spent three years assisting the Research Department  in codifying and indexing the Baha'i Writings. 

 When his wife developed asthma


<p792>

  and was advised to reside in a more favourable climate they left the Holy Land with keen regret. 

 Mr. Maviddat continued to the end of his life to translate and write. 
He translated into Persian 

Shoghi Effendi's The       

 Advent of Divine Justice, as well as numerous letters, cables and compilations. He also wrote in Persian an introductory book on the Faith. His last few years were spent in Australia. With the persecution and apparent suppression  of the Faith in frdn, and its manifest progress in Australia and the Pacific, he would often quote Baha'u'llah's words about His Revelation that should they attempt to conceal its light on the continent, it will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean, and, raising its voice, proclaim: 'I am the life-giver of the world!' 

 We cannot conclude this short biography of Mr. Maviddat without mention of his wife, Tali'ih 'AT&f, who was his companion for more than half a century and who, with her kind nature, faith and perseverance gave him total love, devotion and wholehearted encouragement in completing his work. 

 After his departure from this world the above cable was communicated by the Universal  House of Justice, thus crowning his achievements with words of love and appreciation  from that august Institution.

ARDESHIR ROSTAMPOUR        
  (ARDAST{{R RUSTAMPQR)      

 19Q1 —  1982 Ardeshir Rostampour was born of Zoroastrian  parents in the village of Kuche Buyuk, near Yazd, fr4n. 

 He was a small child when his father died. 

 His father had taken two wives, and Ardeshir's mother, the second wife, was both mute and deaf. 

 'The two of us were left dependent upon my half-brother,' 

Ardeshir related. 'I Jived 

 with my mother and worked as a servant for my half-brother; he was a very rough man and used me as a slave. 

 I gradually became dissatisfied with my life. When I was about ten years old I learned that .a caravan, bound for Bombay, was passing not far from our village. 

 Through the use of sign language I conveyed to my mother my wish to escape my 

   Ardeshir Rostampour        

  miserable existence and go to India where I hoped to be able to earn some money to make life easier for her. She graiited her consent, we took tearful leave of one another and I set off, taking as provision for my journey my meagre savings amounting to about the equivalent of one dollar, and five pieces of dried bread which I wrapped in a handkerchief. For two days and two nights I wandered alone in the desert in search of the caravan, vainly asking every passerby if he knew of its whereabouts. 

 Finally I caught sight of it when it stopped for the evening. I was invited to join the caravan through the kindness of some people from my village who were travelling with it, one of whom, a Zoroastrian lady who had been a teacher in our village, engaged me as a servant and compensated me handsomely for my services. 

 Through her generosity I was able to travel by steamer to Karachi where I found employment. I used to send all I had earned to my mother, asking her to distribute whatever she would not need herself to the needy ones in our village. Later on I managed to go on to Bombay, and after a while I came to Hyderabad, Sind, where I opened a restaurant. 

 I have stayed here ever since.


<p793>
IN MEMORIAM                793

  From his earnings in the restaurant, Arde-shir made gifts to his village, establishing first a long-needed cemetery for the Zoroastrian community and later a reservoir to provide drinking water. 

 Two entrances and taps were provided, one for Zoroastrians and one for Muslims, since custom would not allow them to share, and it was his wish that all might benefit equally from the facility. 

 Through meeting early distinguished Baha'i te~ichers, including Mr. Shahriy6r YazdThi, Mr. IsfandiyAr 

BakhtfyAri' and Mr. Pritam Singh/

 whb frequented his restaurant when they travelled to Jr{yderabad on teaching trips, Ardeshir became attracted to the Cause of Baha'u'llah and embraced it. He was a generous host to travelling teachers and enquirers, often accommodating eighteen or twenty guests and arranging personally for their food and comfort. 

 On one occasion Miss Martha Root was an overnight guest. 

 Ardeshir's Baha'i life was lived entirely in the spirit of the words of Shoghi Effendi who encouraged the believers to be 'like the fountain or spring that is continually emptying itself of all that it has and is continually being refilled from an invisible source. 

 To be continually  giving out for the good of our fellows undeterred by the fear of poverty and reliant on the unfailing bounty of the Source of all wealth and all good — this is the secret of right living.'3 He lived a simple life in Spartan surroundings and he gave spontaneously, generously and continually in support of Baha'i undertakings. 

 A contribution he had made was the means of acquiring the land for the Temple in India early in the 

Ten Year Crusade. Learning

 that the National Spiritual Assembly had found a suitable site for the construction of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar but lacked the funds to acquire it he immediately donated his entire savings. Only through strenuous insistence did the representatives of the National Spiritual Assembly succeed in persuading him to accept back a small amount for his Own use. When he was asked on one occasion how he could give all of his money with no thought for himself he replied, 'I did not have a penny when I started. All that I

 Baha'i World, vol. XVI, p. 554. 2 See 'In Memoriam', The Baha'i World, vol. XIII, p. 874.

 had accumulated was given to me by God. Now He needed the money. I said to myself, If He needs the money, I will return all of it to Him. If I am supposed to have money, He will provide me with more, and if I am not supposed to have it, He would take back what I had anyway. 
Therefore, it was easy.   

 I did it with full confidence and a joyful conscience. He has repaid me many times since then and I have always returned it to Him, as I am only a temporary trustee.' 
      It has been written of    

Ardeshir Rostampour:      

 'Never one to seek honour for himself, his services have been rendered so quietly as to have been almost unknown and invisible to all but those members of the institutions of the Faith who received his many contributions. He has given as 'Abdu'l-Baha had always done, in such a way that the right hand was unaware of what the left hand was doing. When Ardeshir said of himself, "I have given everything I have made to the Faith of Baha'u'llah," it was a stark, matter-of-fact and unadorned description of his life, without a trace of personal pride or self-praise.' 

 When his passing on 11 April 1982 was announced, the Universal House of Justice cabled:

 1950 — 1982 Early on a sunny April morning, in 1982, Baha'is of the Western Pacific gathered on a lovely knoll in Saipan, Mariana Islands, overlooking  the blue Pacific, to pay their last respects to beloved 

Suliana Korean. Throughout 

 her thirty-one years, she was an example of strength and courage, and of dedicated service to the Cause of God. 

       Born Suliana Halaholo     

 on Tonga in 1950, she began attending Baha'i children's classes at the age of eight. She studied with joy and was soon herself teaching classes. Her involvement in administrative activities began

 Suliana Halaholo Korean    

  while she was still a youth. She was secretary of the youth committee of Tonga, and later of Fiji, where she attended the University of the South Pacific. She often made teaching trips to other islands, an activity in which she particularly delighted. Academically, also, she shone brilliantly. 

 The government of Tonga sent her to study dietetics at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji, where she obtained her Bachelor's degree. Vacations from, school were not vacations from Suliana's most loved work, service to the Faith. She devoted two of her vacations to translating into the 

Tongan language The Seven  

 Valleys, and at a later time she translated  Words of Wisdom. Both translations were approved by the National Spiritual Assembly of 

Tonga.                     

 After graduating from university, Suliana married Dr. Masao Korean and settled on Ebeye in the Marshall Islands where she pursued her career and devoted herself to raising her children: Ruthann, 

Saane and Suiffin. She     

 learned Marshallese and continued  to make teaching trips to the islands. 

 In 1979 she was appointed an Auxiliary Board member for propagation of the Faith, and through her work for this institution all the Baha'is of the Western Pacific came to know and love her. 

 Although she had no professional training in music she found time to learn to play string instruments. 

 She sang and played at Baha'i gatherings and proclamation events. It was her wish always to bring happiness wherever she was. 

 In June 1981 she moved with her family to Saipan. 

 Shortly thereafter she was appointed to the Regional Teaching Committee for the northern Mariana Islands. 

 However, at this time, tragedy struck. A brain tumor which had been operated on in 1979 began to create physical difficulties for her, although almost no one was aware of her discomfort and she continued to perform her duties. In December she participated in the dedication of the Baha Center on Saipan, joining in the singing and dancing with the same fervor and joy as the other believers. 

 It was perhaps her last public act. To the end, however, Suliana was aware of the love of the Baha'i friends, and of the wonder of the Baha'i teachings. Her talk, during the last month of her life, was of her beloved Cause of God. One week before her passing on 15 April 1982, five pioneer adults and three pioneer children arrWed on Saipan, much to Suliana's joy. The people of Saipan said that their prayers had been answered with the arrival of the pioneers. 

 Perhaps Suliana's special dedication was also in some way balanced at that time. But we know that no one will take her place. No one will carry such love to the islands. 

 At the time of Suliana's burial, Auxiliary Board member Marian Johnson said, 'To know Suliana was to know an angel.' 

 If angel she is — and surely the Baha'is of the Western Pacific would agree — then her love and the example of her faith will always be with us.

     JULIUS HENSELER            

 1901 — 1982 Julius Hensekr left this material world on 30 April 1982 after a short illness. 

 The German Baha'i community has lost a steadfast believer who was an example until his last breath. Doctors, nurses and attendants who treated him during his last illness considered him their favourite patient. 

 He bore his suffering with patience and always had a smile as an expression of thanks for everyone who cared for him.

     Julius Henseler           

  Julius Henseler heard about the Cause of Baha'u'llah in 1921 through a friend who told him that 'Abdu'l-Baha had passed away. Julius was then twenty years old and was known as a seeker among his friends. 

 He attended many Baha functions in Esslingen and Stuttgart and embraced the Cause, developing an unbounded love for 

Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha  
and Shoghi Effendi.       

 With a saddened heart, but obedient to the Baha institutions, he suspended his teaching activities during the period of proscription under Hitler. 

 These were years of crucial importance when he was confined to living the Baha'i life within his family circle consisting of his wife and two children. Cut off from the World Centre and without the guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly, he and his wife Anna remained loyal servants of the Covenant of God. After the war, when the Baha'i institutions had to be rebuilt, he dedicated himself wholeheartedly to this task. From 1949 to 1954 he was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria, and served as its treasurer from time to time. He extended a special love to Baha'i youth. Himself the father of two youth, he enkindled in them a love of the Cause of Baha'u'llah and fostered their spiritual growth. 

 At age seventy, in response to the call of the Universal House of Justice, he arose to pioneer for one year in Innsbruck, Austria, where he was reunited with Pr. Ahmedzadeh and Mrs. von Werthern with whom he had served on the National Spiritual Assembly many years before. This was a highlight of his life for he was once more in a position to devote all his energies to the Faith which he loved above all else. 

 'I am leaving this world in peace. I am at peace with everyone and hold no grudge against anyone. 

 I have already seen 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Master.' These were some of the last words he spoke to his family. 

     On 3 May 1982 the Universal

 1910 — 1982 Know thou that the souls of the people of Baha, who have entered and been established within the Crimson Ark, shall associate and commune intimately one with another, and shall be so closely associated in their lives, their aspirations, their aims and strivings as to be even as one soul. They are indeed the ones who are well-informed, keen-sighted, and who are endued with understanding. 

                  Baha'u'llah                

  These words of the Blessed Beauty came to me as the greatest balm in my direst moment. My beloved father, while on a visit to the United States for treatment, expired peacefully  on 8 May 1982 in Oakbrook, Illinois, after unsuccessful major surgery for internal abdbminal haemorrhage. Beside him were my mother, Mrs. Shirin Joshi, sisters, Dr. Par


<p796>

   Asanand Chagla Joshi       

  veen and Dilafroz, and brother-in-law, Dr. Azam. 

 I was in Karachi. Sorrowing friends attended his graveside in the Arlington Cemetery in Elmhurst and a befitting memorial meeting was held on 30 May in Skokie during which the Hand of the Cause Dhikru'116h KLPdem described him as a 'dedicated Baha'i who truly served the Cause'. 

 A memorial gathering was also held in Karachi on 10 SeptembQr. 

 My father was born on 10 June 1910 into a priestly 

Hindu family; Sanskrit     

 and Hindu scriptures came to him with his mother's milk. He graduated in law in 1914 and started a successful legal practice. 

 He learned eleven languages, mastering nine, and was awarded a gold medal for 

Sanskrit by Bombay University. 

 In 1945 he was accepted into the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Mr. Dipchand Khianra, whose appointment to the 

Continental Board of Counsellors

 in Western Asia was announced on 8 June 1973, was greatly responsible for enabling him to recognize the truth of the Baha'i Faith. 

 Soon after embracing the Faith he was elected a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Karachi. In 1947, when Pakistan was born, he served as chairman of the Local Assembly. In 1948 he was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of India, Pakistan  and Burma, and in 1958, when the National Spiritual Assembly of Pakistan came into being, he served as its chairman. 

 Thus his administrative service extended over a period of approximately twenty-five years. 

    Counsellor Dipchand Khianra

 writes: 'Esteemed  Bakhtiari had built a house to establish  a children's school like the Panchgani School in India. The building was requisitioned by a senior government executive who would not vacate. 

 Mr. Joshi fought in the law courts for ye•ars and won the case. The building today houses the famed "New 

Day Montes-son  School".   

 A silver-tongued orator, he organized many symposia in the Baha Hall, Karachi, in which prominent citizens and scholars of Pakistan participated; addressed hundreds ofjatherings; went in deputation to General 

Ayub KMn, the President    

 of Pakistan,  who, impressed by his sincerity, thereafter regarded him as a friend. 

 As a member of the Auxiliary Board, appointed in 1974, he played a most vital part in teaching the Faith to Hindus in the interior of Pakistan and undertaking many teaching tours. It is pertinent to state that these Baha'is comprise seventy-five per cent of the members of the Baha'i community of Pakistan.' 

 Another unforgettable service was his ceaseless effort to win recognition for the Faith as a separate minority religious community. In Septembe? 1972 the government of Pakistan  accorded this iecognition, the first ever achieved in an Islamic country. In his report to the National Spiritual Assembly he wrote, 'A victory has been won, a goal of the Nine Year Plan achieved. 
History was made when the  

Islamic Republic of Pakistan
issued a letter from the   

Law Minister to the National Spiritual

 Assembly assuring that all the minority religious communities, including the Baha'is, are free to profess their Faith, and the State [government of Pakistani will in the discharge of its responsibilities give no cause of complaint to any community or religious minority. It is stated that under the Interim Constitution freedom of expression [free speech] 

 is guaranteed.' He also secured tax exemption for the Baha'i properties and led the Baha'i delegation to the first Minorities Committees' Conference held at Quetta,


<p797>
IN MEMORIAM               797

Pakistan. The Minister     

 for Religious Minorities presided over the meeting and expressed the fervent hope that Baha'is would contribute to the welfare and prosperity of the country. For the first time Baha speeches and prayers were televised throughout Pakistan. 

 A rdnowned lawyer, he served as honorary legal adviser to the Baha'i administrative bodies for thirty years. As a member of the District Minority Committee he represented the Baha'i community to the government for many years and was, on countless occasions, the Baha'i representative to the United Nations. 

 In all activities in the administrative field he served wholeheartedly and always readily offered his assistance in resolving crucial problems. He was given the status of an intellectual by nearly every President of Pakistan. Ever ready to serve the Cause, he advised us to be firm Baha'is, saying, 'Children, you must ally yourself with the spiritual army of Baha'u'llah. Faith is not a halfway house.' 

 A few days before he died he said that he wanted his grave to teach the Cause. Inscribed on his tombstone is a stanza from Baha'u'llah's  Hidden 

Words. May the Blessed     

 Beauty elevate in the Abh6 Kingdom the station of one who so meritoriously and untiringly devoted his life to the firm establishment of the Cause of God in Pakistan.

  Few walk among men and invoke a spirit of love and admiration, respect and reverence that continues to inspire long after they have departed for the Abh6 Kingdom,. those with whom they came in contact during their earthly life. One such man was Jal6l Nakhja-vAnf,  a truly great Baha'i teacher, firmly rooted in his beloved Faith, deeply conversant with human history and international affairs, a scholar who was superbly capable of speaking fluently several languages of the East and the West. 
       He was born on 17 September

1917 in Baku, Southern     
Russia, to Fdtimih Khanfim Tabrizi

 and 'Ali-Akbat NakhjavAni, who were married at the suggestion of the beloved Master. 

 His father was one of the key believers in Baku and had regular correspon-Jaldi 

Na4ftjavdni


<p798>
798                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  dence with the Master from Whom he received numerous Tablets and instructions. 

Mirza 'Ah-Akb6r Nakhjav~ni 

 later accompanied 'Abdu'l-Baha on His travels in the West. Jal6l's mother, F~timih Khan6m, was the eldest daughter of two eminent believers whose mention is made in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Memorials of the Faithful, as she came from a line of believers who accompanied Baha'u'llah on His exile to the Hoiy Land. She and her sister, Zeenat Khanhm Baha'u'llah, spent many years as attendants in the Master's household in 'Akka After the tragic passing of 'Alf-Akbar Na~javThi, and owing to the political upheaval  in Russia, FAtimih Khaniim was advised  by 'Abdu'l-Baha to travel to the Holy land and reside there with her two small Sons, Jal6l aged four and 'All aged two. En route to the Holy Land the shattering news came of the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 FAtimili Khantim immediately stopped theft journey and awaited the decision of Shoghi Effendi, an example of her implicit servitude and obedience to the Faith and its administrative order which she imparted and instilled so lovingly in her children. Shoghi Effendi urged her to continue  on her way to the Holy Land and thus it was that Jaldi and his brother had the honour and privilege of growing up under the shadow of the Hoiy Shrines, and in Haifa, so blessed by the presence of the beloved Guardian and of the Greatest 

Holy Leaf.                 

 From his youngest years JaM was reared in the spirit of service exemplified by his mother and he acquired that devotion to Shoghi Effendi which was to characterize his acts of 'instant, exact and complete obedience' throughout his life. He attended the ltcole des Fr6res of the Jesuits in Haifa until he was of age to enter the American University in Beirut where he graduated in English Literature. 
He was fluent in both      

French and Arabic.         

 In 1937, at the injunction of Shoghi Effendi, Jahi and his mother returned to lr~n; a year later his mother passed away in TihrAn. Jaltd served his two years of compulsory military service and then entered the banking profession. 

 In 1943 he married Darakhshandih Na'imf, the only daughter of 

Maljhhbih and Dari-i-Mu'ayyad

 (Musin) Na'fmi, and six months later the young couple enthusiastically embarked on homefront pioneering to the towns of Buriijird and later Kirmansh.ih where they stayed until the early 1950s when the call came from Shoghi Effendi for Persian pioneers to arise and open new territories for the Faith in Africa. 

 This exhortation of the beloved Guardian's to take the Faith of Baha'u'llah to Africa, the dark continent which was soon to become the continent of light, evoked an immediate response from JalAl. He relinquished an important promotion as head of the Foreign Exdhange Department of Bank Melli of Iran and set out immediately for 

East Africa. In October    

 1950 JalAl set foot on the soil of East Africa as the first Baha pioneer and by December of that year he had settled in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika  (now Tanzania), with his characteristic exuberance and optimism, ready to overcome eyery obstacle in the advancement of his beloved Faith. He was joined in June 1951 by his wife, his daughters Mona and Izioda, and his brother-in-law, Farhang Na'inif. His third child, a son, Ramin, was born in Dar-es-Salaam  in 1956. 

 This was a difficult time, a period of two years when Jal6l had no work and when he had to use all his savings to maintain his family. The heat of East Africa was intense. But it was during these years that his teaching efforts were crowned with exhilarating results. Their home was a focal point for the African friends to gather, hear and accept the soul-stirring message of Baha'u'llah. 

 Ja1AT was instrumental in assisting a number of pioneers to settle in Africa at the beginning of the Ten Year Crusade launched by the beloved Guardian. 

 Despite hardships and difficulties, Jal6l persisted, and with his natural adaptiveness  and joyous vit~1ity, lent his share of energy to the firm establishment of the 

Cause in East Africa.      
He served on the first     

Local Spiritual Assembly   

 of Dar-es-Salaam (1952) and was elected to the first 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Central and East Africa (1954). He performed whatever duties he was given with zeal and enthusiasm. 
In 1954 the Hand of the    

Cause of God Mtisd Ban6nf  

 appointed him one of his nine Auxiliary Board members. It was at this time that Jal6l made extensive teaching trips visiting the islands of Zanzibar, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and the Comoro Islands. His dynamic and vibrant


<p799>
IN MEMORIAM               799

  personality, his total and unquestioned devotion and his deep knowledge of the Baha'i Writings, especially in the fields of Baha'i history and administration, influenced and galvanized the believers. 

 When Shoghi Effendi announced the need for pioneers to open the virgin territories of the Belgian Congo (now Zaire), Jal6l immediately arose, arranged his travel documents  and started out. When he reached Nairobi, Kenya, he received a cable from the Guardian telling him to return and maintain his post,in Dar-es-Salaam, an instruction with which he immediately complied. These were glorious years of expansion and consolidation, years that made history and brought triumphs in the teaching field in Africa which gladdened the heart of the beloved Guardian. 
    The passing of Shoghi      

Effendi in November 1957   

 was a terrible and shattering blow jn the entire Baha'i world, but it was a personal loss for Jal4l to whom the Guardian had been an inspiration all his life. 

 He renewed his teaching trips with greater diligence and was instrumental, at the specific request of the Hands of the Cause, in confirming and deepening in the Covenant, ihe believers on the islands of the Indian Ocean. 

 Throughout Jal6l's remaining years in Africa he continued to be an outstanding example of radiant steadfastness, of contented servitude, spreading  joy, humour and delight wherever he went and showering love and happiness on all whom he met. To his last days he performed every service for the love of Shoghi Effendi and it was with the same dedication that~ he maintained his services to the Universal House of Justice. 

 In 1967, after having spent almost seventeen years in Africa, he moved with his family to West Germany, ready to face a new challenge with undiminished zeal. Here he continued to render inestimable services to anyone who required help in settling in Europe, performing every task with courtesy and loving kindness, care and understanding. Of him it can be truly said that he raised the downtrodden, comforted the hopeless, assisted the weary unfamiliar traveller and quenched the hunger and thirst, whether material or spiritual, of those who search among the multitudinous confusing theories of men. He was a valued member of the 

Local                      

 Spiritual Assembly of Hamburg/Eimsbuttel and was a delegate to the 

National Convention  a    

 number of times, contributing his irrepressible enthusiasm to the consultation each RidvTh. He and his wife pioneered to Neumuenster, West Germany, and assisted in the initial stages of the establishment of the first Local Spiritual Assembly there. For eleven years, in spite of language impediment, he gave of both time and energy to the work of the Faith until 1978 when he and his wife decided to move to Canada where their daughter, Mona, had already settled. 

 It was in Canada, during the last four years of his earthly life which he had lived so fully and richly in the service of his beloved Faith, that he gave of every last ounce of his unique capacities. 

 As a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Selkirk, Manitoba, he was both distinguished and accessible to all who needed his encouragement and love. As a member of the National Pioneering Committee of Canada he contributed from the wealth of his experience and inspired future pioneers with his optimism. As a travelling teacher throughout  the province of Quebec and the Maritimes, he was a source of vitality and joy, enthusing the believers with his spontaneous nature, delighting them with his sense of humour, inspiring them with his depth of knowledge and unrestrained flow of stories on every facet of life and with the example of his zeal. 

 His travels in Canada and particularly in Quebec were of great benefit, for he was able to communicate with fluency and depth of feeling in French, a language he dearly loved. French-speaking Canadians remember him with great love and respect. 

 A believer who visited the Maritime area shortly after his death wrote, 'Everyone misses ~Ja16i. It is beyond the capacity of my words to tell you just how much and in what ways and to how profound a degree this extraordinary, ebullient, magnanimous spirit touched the hearts and revivified  the life of the souls of the people here. He was a catalyst, a mover. He exuded wellbeing and delight in life that tantalized the seeker and confirmed the believer in the Cause. Remembrance of him never fails to bring the glow of sunlight to people's faces.' 

 In October 1981, immediately after an extensive teaching trip to Quebec, the Man-times and the French islands of the Atlantic


<p800>
800                 THE HAHA'( WORLD

  Ocean — a trip during which he appeared on television and radio and became the instrument  through which a number of people accepted the Faith — Jal6l became suddenly ill. Despite surgery in January 1982 his health declined rapidly and he passed away peacefully on 9 May. The year of his passing was that of the fiftieth anniversary of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the passing of the beloved Guardian, the two shining figures who had inspired his love, devotion and service to the Faith since his earliest years. Jal6l's blessed remains were laid to rest in St. Clements Cemetery in Selkirk, Manitoba; this, too, was a service to the Faith as it enabled the purchase of a Baha burial plot. The Hand of the Cause of God John Robarts, a dear friend of long standing since the days of pioneering in Africa, attended the funeral along with an enormous assemblage of people from all strata of society and of many racial and religious backgrounds upon whom Jahil Nakh-javThf  had left a deep and lasting impression by virtue of his radiant nature. A special delegation of members of the United Nations Association on whose executive committee JaL6l had served actively in Winnipeg also attended the funeral to pay their respects to a truly unforgettable man. His family was inundated with telegrams and letters from all across the world recounting his innumerable services, recording the impact of his dynamic personality and remarking upon the laughter and joy he had showered upon all whom he met and the memory of which would remain with them for ever. He left behind a testimony that valiant heroism and service to the true interests of humanity are alive and thriving, and that exemplary and effective action will continue to inspire those remaining in this transient world. 

 The truly great are those, such as Ja1M Na4jav~ni, whose very memory, long after their passing on to a nobler habitation, befitting their station, will continue to stir in people the desire to do the Will of the Creator. Those who reflect on the actions of Jal6l Na~!jav6ffi perpetuate the remembrance of one who was a true servant of God and a lover of mankind.

      EUGEN SCHMIDT              

 1901 — 1982 We take leave of Dr. Eugen Schmidt. A fulfilled life has come to an end. A great, pure soul has ascended to its eternal home. 

 Eugen Schmidt was born in Stuttgart on 22 February 1901. He grew up in an austere Christian home where basic religious values and ethics were imprinted d&eply upon his mind. 'God grants success to the sincere,' was his guiding motto. 

 In his early youth his alert intellect had discovered the many terrible conificts of life, and especially those afflicting human society; experiencing the First World War as a youth made him an ardent seeker. Deep in his heart he felt that the solution to humanity's problems lay not in brute force but in intellectual enlightenment, philosophical  endeavour, unbiased and world-embracing religious consciousness and an improved social order. 

 After the war he gathered about him a circle of like-minded friends who, without regard to political affiliations, worked enthusiastically  and with great conviction for the cause of world peace, settifig before their


<p801>
IN MEMORIAM                801

  listeners at youth congresses, and at functions they themselves organized, the high aspirations they held for an enlightened society in which all would work together in harmony. 

 Alieady, then, we glimpse Eugen Schmidt as he will live on in our memory: a man of passionate convictions and thoroughly thought-out views which he was able to present with great eloquence. 

 About 1924 he encountered the Baha'i Faith. He must have been a very critical and chall9nging God-seeker at first, but the longer and more actively he explored the all-encompassing, clear concepts of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, the more deeply convinced he became of their validity. The vision of the World Order of Baha'u'llah captivated him and became the motivating force of his life. 

 Because of his father's unemployment, Eugen Schmidt began studying rather late. In 1932 he obtained a doctorate in political science. 

 Professionally, he had for many years held a leading position in industry. 

 After his military service and war captivity he was employed in the service of Public Health and Social Security, a field about which he had written in his doctoral thesis. 

 As a writer, editor and organizer he was constantly expending  his energies on behalf of a 'healthy nation. 

 On one of the first occasions when he presented a Baha'i paper at a youth conference he met Erna Kauffmann whom he later married. 

 Two sons and one daughter were born of this happy marriage. 

 Eugen Schmidt was one of the most active, conscientious and enterprising German Baha'is.  If, in the thirties and fifties — before and after the prohibition imposed by the Nazi regime — there were three believers wbb decisively influenced the German Baha'is and led them as they took their very first steps towards fulfilling that great vision which Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi had of the spiritual reality of the German people, they were the three doctors: llermann Grossmann, the visionary of the new Covenant of God and the divine World Order; Adelbert Miihlschlegel, the poet and mystic; and Eugen Schmidt, the pragmatic organizer, who was capable of advancing the German Baha'i community, step by step, closer to the practical  realization of its spiritual goals. 

 He was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany from 1932 onwards, and its chairman in the decisive years of rebuilding after World War II. He was also a member of the Spiritual Assemblies of his home communities  of Stuttgart and then Leinfelden-Echterdingen; editor of Baha'i Nachrichten, the newsletter of Germany, and of Sonne der Wahrheit, a Baha'i periodical; an ever-available  public speaker and lecturer; an enthusiastic organizer of and participant in large international conferences, World Religion  Day observances and other gatherings; and the author and translator of articles. It is my hope that the Baha Publishing Trust of Germany will soon haye the privilege of producing a memorial volume of his selected essays. 

 For myself, and surely also for my friend, Dieter Schubert, the editorial consultations  with Eugen Schmidt about the first issues of Baha'i Briefe were among the most fruitful inspirations of our younger years. As a postscript to a letter written to Eugen Schmidt on his behalf on 9 April 1955, Shoghi Effendi inscribed these words, 'May the Almighty bless your meritorious endeavours, guide every step you take, and aid you to enrich the record of your deeply appreciated services to His Faith.' 

 Without the intensive, personal, sacrificial service of Eugen Schmidt we would not have witnessed the dedication of the national Haziratu'1-Quds (1952) nor that of the first European House of Worship (1964). He served the Cause of Baha'u'llah for many years as a member of the Auxiliary Board and, until his strength waned in old age, he worked for the Baha Public Relations Committee and the liaison committee of the Baha'i International Community at the United Nations. In all these sacrificial and timeconsuming undertakings extending over more thanThaif a century, Dr. Schmidt had the close companionship of his trusted coworker and dependable comrade, Erna. 

 Few families have more fully exemplified the spirit of the new age in their everyday 1iving~ The Schmidt home w~s an inviolable centre of harmony, the embodiment of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Words, a house of peace, a house of happiness and exultation. 

 The German Baha'i community is deeply indebted to Eugen Schmidt. Only later genera

  Ecology is not a new branch of science, but rather one newly appreciated by recent generations. 

 This interest in the pattern of relations between organisms and their environment is no longer the preserve of academics;  the general public's concern in this field has assumed an increasingly important profile. As with so many other areas of human endeavour, the questioning of inherited traditional  values in the mid-1800s encompassed our relationship to the natural environment. One of the most important figures in articulating  these questions and engaging the public in a search for new directions was an Englishman  who became widely known as 'the Man of the Trees'. 

 Richard St. Barbe Baker, usually addressed 

   I Richard                 
 Richard St. Barbe Baker    

  as St. Barbe, was born on 9 October 1889 at West End, near Southampton, in England. His long life as a forester, author and conservationist  brought to many generations the message of the importance of the natural environment and; in particular, trees. His unique synthesis of the practical knowledge of a trained forester and an almost mystical vision of the role that forests play in the life of man served to inspire millions of people the world over to become involved in restoring what he referred to as the '. earth's green mantle, the Trees'. He was the first Baha'i to achieve international recognition for his forestry and environmental work, and so it is appropriate to examine not oniy the contribution  he made to his profession, but also to the influence of the Baha Faith on his development. 

 As a young man, St. Barbe went to homestead  in Canada in response to a call for Christian men to attend to the spiritual needs of settlers on the prairies. He bought land in the newly — created province of Saskatchewan,


<p803>
IN MEMORIAM                803

  and devoted himself to building up congregations in rural areas. Then, in 1909, he enrolled in the first class of the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon. 

 It was while living in the Canadian west that he first saw the effects of the sudden disruption of an entire ecosystem. 

 The ploughing up of immense areas of prairie grasslands to create farms, with only sporadic compensation measures such as planting tree shelterbelts, resulted in much valuable topsoil being blown away. Similarly, when he began working at a lumber camp in northern Saskatchewan, he witnessed the unnecessary waste of trees as virgin forests were logged. He left for England in 1912, determined that one day he would be involved in forestry and conservation work. However, the Christian ministry was still his first calling, and he enrolled in Divinity at Ridley Hall, Cambridge. 

 This pursuit was soon interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, in response to which he enlisted and served in France. 

 Following the war St. Barbe returned to Cambridge and this time took a diploma in Forestry at Cajus 

College.                   

 Thus qualified, he went to Kenya in 1920 to serve under the Colonial Office as Assistant Conservator of Forests. In Africa he again saw evidence of the tendency to take too much from the land and to exploit excessively the forests. In the highlands of Kenya large tracts of land had been devastated by a combination of the introduction of goats, the clear-felling of forests and the arrival of white settlers. 

 $t. Barbe conceived a plan to restore the indigenous forests using a system under which food crops were planted between rows of young native trees. 

 Several years of crops would be harvested before the tree~ grew to a size that necessitated moving to a new site, leaving behind a potential forest and demonstrating  that supplying people's basic needs is not incompatible with managing forests. Thousands of tree seedlings were needed for the operation, and departmental funds that St. Barbe had at his disposal were negligible. 

 In 1922 he took a step, unprecedented at the time, to remedy this lack of funds. He consulted with the Africans themselves, approaching  the Kikuyu Chiefs and Elders in the area and enquiring how their tribesmen could be enlisted to help with tree planting. He worked with them to develop a scheme for the voluntary planting of trees. This resulted in three thousand warriors coming to his camp from among whom, with the assistance of the Chiefs, he selected fifty to be the first Warn wa Mi4, or Men of the Trees. 

 They promised before N'gai, the High God, that they would protect the native forest, plant ten native trees each year, and take care of trees everywhere. The society of The Men of the Trees later spread to many other countries and its membership  today includes men and women from all walks of life. 

His Royal Highness the Prince

 of Wales became the Patron of the organization in 1979. 

 In the last decade foresters have begun to realize that the answer to defore~tation lies in persuading the local people that safeguarding their forests will preserve their livelihoods, while planting new forests will actually enhance their standards of living. 

 This approach of enlisting local people is now called 'social' forestry. St. Barbe began implementing this idea half a century before it became accepted practice, and was the object of much criticism during his early days for becoming too involved  with the indigenous people of Kenya and elsewhere. He lived long enough to see the climate of opinion change and to witness recognition of his pioneering work in helping to pave the way for the adoption of a new philosophy in forestry. 

 After leaving Kenya in 1924, St. Barbe went back to England where he read a paper on African Bantu beliefs at the First 

Congress  of Living Religions
within the Commonwealth.  

 At the conclusion of his talk he was approached by Claudia Stewart Coles who introduced him to the Baha'i Faith by explaining that his genuine interest in another's religion struck a sympathetic chord with the Baha principles. 

 Under her guidance  St. Barbe studied the Faith and embraced  it shortly aft6r. 

 Although he was later appointed Assistant Conservator of Forests for the southern-provinces in Nigeria and served in this post from 1924 to 1929, there was one event during St. Barbe's tenure in Kenya that prevented his ever rising higher within the ranks of the Colonial Office: a superior officer attempted to strike a Kikuyu worker with the butt end of a rifle and St. Barbe stepped in to intercept. He felt that it was an unfair action and took


<p804>
804                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the blow on his own shoulder. 

 Considered an outrageous act of insubordination at the time, the episode is still remembered by Africans. It helped St. Barbe in enlisting their support for his many tree-planting programmes. He was later to reflect that: 'My discharge from the Colonial Service liberated me for much greater work in reafforestation and earth regeneration in other parts of the world.' 

 The first indication of the new direction of his career came in 1929 when the High Commissioner of Palestine, Sir John Chancel-br,  asked St. Barbe to apply the lessons garnered during his time in Kenya to help unify disparate religionists in the British protectorate. 

 In a move that indicated his appreciation of the role of the Baha'i Faith, St. Barbe's first action was to approach its Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, who became the first life member of The Mcii of the Trees in Palestine. Working closely with the High Commissioner, St. Barbe then went on to enlist the Chancellor of the Hebrew University, the Grand Mufti of the Supreme Muslim Council, the Latin Patriarch, the Bishop of Jerusalem and others, explaining that: K there was no land needing trees more than Palestine and no land would respond so well to planting.' 

 From this initiative, forty-two nurseries were established. However, St. Barbe realized that providing the seedlings was not enough, and so he set out to establish tree planting as part of the culture, as he had done so successfully in Kenya. 

 To this end he was instrumental in making Tu Bi'Shvat (the traditional Feast of Trees) a national tree-planting  day which is~ now taken up by most Israeli schoolchildren. In his project in Palestine St. Barbe had the active support of notables including 

Field Marshal Viscount Allenby
and Sir Francis Younghusband.

 His ability to enlist the help of prominent figures was now combined with his appreciation of the practical side of forestry and an understanding of how to involve local people in his plans. Thus was set a pattern of action which was to result in the involvement of millions of men and women around the world in the planting of billions of trees. 

 For many, St. Barbe will be remembered for two of his undertakings which more than any others seemed to capture the public's imagination: his work to save large tracts of California coastal redwood trees, and his plans to reclaim millions of acres of the Sahara desert. 

 By the early 1930s the redwoods of California were under threat from lumber operations.  Although there was talk of saving small groves of these trees, St. Barbe felt it was necessary to set aside an aiea large enough to sustain the natural climate needed by the micro-forest. 

 He raised interest in his plans by lecturing extensively across the United States and Britain. With a modest financial contribution towards the 'save the redwoods' project from The Men of the Trees in the United Kingdom, St. Barbe was able to attract the attention of the American public who in turn responded with contributions amounting to over ten million dollars. 

 The result was that a natural reserve of twelve thousand acres of redwoods was handed over to the State of California to be preserved for all time. 

 In 1952, with the blessing of several major universities, St. Barbe led the first 

Sahara University Expedition.
His book Sahara Challenge 

 describes the 9,000-mile journey and outlines his conviction that the phenomenal pace with which the Sahara over the centuries was merging into the Libyan desert could be arrested, further encroachment prevented and reclamation undertaken if the correct action was taken. As in other areas, St. Barbe was ahead of the times in his vision of trees forming a 'Green Front' against the Sahara and other deserts. 

 Only recently have govern-meats and international agencies such as the United Nations begun to properly address the issue of the spreading of deserts. And yet ~t. Barbe was aware of the root cause of this delay. He wrote: 'The conquest of the desert will have to start with the conquest of the heart of man. We have witnessed tremendous strides in scientific research and inventions, but it is obvious that the spiritual advance of mankind has not kept pace with scientific progress.' 

 He presented the challenge of reclaiming the Sahara as: '. A One World Purpose' that 'would unite East and West and be the scientific and physical answer to the world's dilemma.' 

 For many years following his acceptance of the Baha Faith, people would often know St. Barbe for some time before learning that he


<p805>
IN MEMORIAM                805

  was a Baha'i, for he was also an Edwardian —  a composite of convention, eccentricity and very strong principles — who found it difficult to discuss religion, let alone ascribe himself publicly to this 'unconventional' Faith. However,  as his friend of many years, David Hofman, said of St. Barbe's very first encounter  with Baha'i: 'He always said that this was the beginning of his true life, and he realized that he derived so much benefit from these Baha'i prayers~ that it was only fair that he should serve the Baha'i Faith to the best of his ability. '.Mr. Hofman also noted that:'. 

 he spread knowledge of the Faith wherever he went and was greatly admired by Shoghi Effendi for his dedication to the cause of humanity.' He served the Faith throughout his life in his work as a forester and author. 

 He wrote: 'The simple act of planting a tree, which is in itself a practical deed, is also the symbol of a far-reachi1 g ideal, which is creative in the realm of the spirit, and in turn reacts upon society, encouraging all to work for the future wellbeing of humanity rather than for immediate gain.' 

 A letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to St. 

Barbe on 31 May 1953       

 bears a postscript  in the Guardian's own hand: 'May the Almighty abundantly reward you for your splendid and manifold activities in the service of the Faith, and enable you to enrich continually the record of your greatly valued and meritorious accomplishments, Your true and grateful brother St. Barbe died on 9 June 

1982 in Saskatoon. Although

 he was in his ninety-second year, he was still full of plans and was working on his thirty-first book. 

 Just days before his death he planted his last tree on the grounds of the University of Saskatchewan. 

 He had gone full circle to return to the place which had helped kindle a vision that, fuelled by the Baha'i Faith, aided the creation of a new understanding  in the consciousness of men of the importance  of trees.

    HENRY BRECHTEFELD          

 1929 — 1982 Henry Brechtefeld passed on to the Abh6 Kingdom on 13 September 1982 in his fifty-third third year. He was born on the island of Marakei in the Kiribati (formerly Gilbert) Islands. He came from a strict Catholic family and received his education at a church school. He left the Gilbert Islands as a youth and went to New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) to live with an uncle. Later he settled in the Solomon Islands where he first worked with the government, then for Mr. and Mrs. Alvin I. Blum, and then went into business on his own. He opened a secondhand clothing store. This was a great boon to the island people who could not afford new clothes. Later this industry  was taken up by the Solomon Islanders and the Chinese and has spread throughout the Solomons. 

 The Blums were the first to tell Henry of the Baha'i Faith and later he came into contact with the musician, Russ Garcia, and his wife, Gina, who were in the Solomons for a short time. He became very attracted through their songs and the meetings he had with them. They gave him books to read and he became deeply touched by the Baha'i teachings. 

 A truly amazing change came into his life and he became completely dedicated to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 It was this change in Henry that


<p806>
806                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  created a deep impression. 

 Formerly he drank heavily and was an inveterate gambler. He immediately gave up drinking and when he became aware of the admonition about gambling he told his friends not to come to his house for this purpose. His family and friends, many of whom were of Gilbertese background, were at first antagonistic because he was teaching a new Faith. However, Henry displayed patience and persistence. He started classes and firesides in a room he built at the back of his store which was located in the village of White River, about three miles from the township of Honiara. 

 Gradually he won to the Faith most of his family. 

 His saintly old mother, who could not speak English, would sit quietly day after day, listening and observing  and lost in thought, when suddenly the veil was rent and she became a radiant 

Baha'i.                     
    Henry was elected to the   

National Spiritual Assembly

 and served until he was named an Auxiliary Board member. He travelled to different islands of the Solomons — Savo, St. Christobal, 

Western Solomons, Tulagi   

 and Guadacanal. He brought into the Faith a very outstanding personality of great capacity, one well versed in the Bible and a sound teacher of the Cause today, who, too, has travelled extensively teaching the Faith; he is now chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly and with several other members of the National Assembly attended the International 

Convention in Haifa.       

 Henry developed diabetes in the last year of his life and experienced great tests — marital, financial and health. However, his very strong faith in meeting these problems was an example to all of us. He had a longing to go back to his native Kiribati and to the Marshalis where he had spent some time in his early days. 

 His condition was aggravated by a coral cut he received and he returned to the Solomons very ill. He might have been spared if he had consented to have his leg and arm amputated. 

 This he refused to do, as he was already longing for that other world which had now become very near to him. 

 The last days of his life were very poignant and sweet. The many youth he taught in White River came as in vigil and sang the songs he loved in the Gilbertese language and songs of the Faith. With great love he counselled them to dedicate their lives to the teaching of the Faith and exhorted them to become examples worthy of this great Cause. This they have done and are doing. 

 They have become a very united group, teaching and singing their way to the hearts of the people. 

 It is said that there are as many ways to God as there are breaths. How can one gauge the hunger of a soul for its Creator, when one who was a drunkard and gambler can change in the twinkling of an eye through the Words of the Blessed Beauty and render 'instant, exact and complete obedience' to His Cause? 

 Many people of all denominations came to the funeral of Henry Brechtefeld and were visibly touched by the funeral service and the spirit of the Faith. 

 His remains are buried in the Baha'i cemetery close to the Haziratu'1-Quds of the Solomon Islands.

  Max Seep~ was the first 'Coloured' believer to embrace the Faith in South Africa. His declaration was made in July 1955 when he was forty-five years of age. He was a teacher by profession and had taught in many cities in South Africa, but at this time he was working for an insurance company, a job which he held until the end of his life. He lived in Western Township, Johannesburg. 

 He had distinguished himself through his services as a Scout and he was active in the St. John Ambulance Association as a first-aid assistant. 

 Western Township was one of several 'Coloured' townships in Johannesburg. 

 The Seep6 home soon became the focal point of Baha'i teaching work. In his enthusiastic teaching Max was assisted by his wife, May, who enrolled in the Faith later that year and became the first 'Coloured' woman believer in South Africa. For many years Max


<p807>
IN MEMORIAM                807

      Lot Max Seep6              

  served as chairman of the Local Spiritual Assembly for Western, Newclare and Sophia-town  Townships. 

 Eventually this Assembly was integrated into the Johannesburg Assembly  as restrictions in the country relaxed. 

 Max continued to serve on this Assembly until his passing. 

 In the firesides at the Seep6 home, Max and May were assisted by Florence Marumo Peter Thebenare, 

Andrew Mofokeng, and William

 Masehia. In those early days there were also deepening classes conducted by William Sears and his wife, Marguerite, at their farm. Max made certain that the Western Township Baha'i community was regular in attending such classes; he could, indeed, be considered the father of the 'Coloured' believers in Johannesburg. 

 In April 1956 Max was elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of 

South and West Africa      

 and served on this institution for twenty-five years. 

 At the time of his passing on 3 October 1982, he was the only original member remaining on the Assembly. 

 During his period of service Max showed several virtues. 

 He was frank and forthright in consultation, was not given to unnecessary speech, took decisions with ease and an almost youth-like enthusiasm and firmly upheld  the application of Baha principles. His phenomenal memory for the various evolutionary steps involved in the development  of the Faith in the region served the Assembly well as new members were added. He believed strongly in fellowship and was always enthusiastic about attending a Convention  or conference, distance and expense being no object. He found ways of economizing in order to travel and teach. 

 Max unfailingly displayed obedience to his Assembly and humility to his fellow believers. Nothing was more paramount than attending the meetings of the National Spiritual Assembly; punctuality delighted him and it was rare that Max was absent or late. His well-worn prayer book, flexible from handling, was always in his breast pocket ready for use. He gave a helping hand to a number of countries in Southern Africa including Swaziland, Lesotho,  Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, Zululand and Mozambique, where he travelled, often with May, on teaching trips or to attend conferences, 

Conventions and Sunner     

 Schools. He attended the first International Convention for the election of the Universal House of Justice, where he served as a teller, and went on to attend the World Congress in London. In 1978 he was again privileged to serve as a teller during the International Convention. He was the official representative of the National Assembly at many conferences over the years and always discharged his responsibilities with honour and dignity. 

 On 9 July 1957 the beloved Guardian wrote to the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of South and West Africa: K considering the diversity of problems this newly-elected Body has had to grapple with since its inception, the grave dangers with which it has been faced, the vastness of the area in which it has been called upon to operate, and the diversity of the peoples and tribes which it has been its privilege to contact, enlighten and direct, its concrete and enduring achievements, in the course of the last twelve months, have been such as to evoke in my heart feelings of unqualified admiration for the manner in which it has discharged its varied and weighty responsibilities. 

 It has indeed, through the wisdom it has displayed, the energy with


<p808>

  which it has laboured,       4 the fidelity which it has abundantly demonstrated, and the courage and single-mindedness with which its members have arisen to discharge iheir mission, set an example worthy of emulation by not only its three sister Assemblies in that continent, but by every other National or Regional Assembly in either the eastern or western hemisphere.' Max was an integral part of that 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 The cable sent by the Continental Board of 

Counsellors  for Africa  

 at the time of Max's passing summarizes his effect upon the continent:

 Although she did not declare her acceptance of the Baha'i Faith until 8 October 1954, she recollected having seen in the spring of 1918 a newspaper headline: a cabled message from General Allenby which read, HAVE TODAY TAKEN 

PALESTINE. NOTIFY THE     
WORLD THAT 'ABDU'L-BAHA   
IS SAFE.1                 

  During World War II her disgust at the senseless violence resulted in her publishing, in cooperation with her husband, two little booklets of spiritual inspiration called The Windows of Heaven and The Little Blue Flame. For these she used the nom de plume Peter Jarvis. Providentially, she chose, in the front of one of them, to quote 

Emerson:                  

 'Man's health and greatness consists of his being the channel through which Heaven flows to earth.' 

 This became the hallmark of her future Baha'i life. 

 Having decided some time prior to becoming a Baha'i that the spiritual path was the one to follow, her qualities as a spiritual healer began to come to the fore. From then, until a few months before her death, she became a healing channel for the relief, and sometimes the seemingly miraculous cure, of many people from all walks of life. Her unshakeable reliance on prayer resulted in many stories of divine aid coming to the rescue. 

 Some of these incidents were very humorous; indeed, humour  was ~ quality which wove itself firmly into her spiritual fabric. 

 From the beginning of her devotion to Baha'u'llah, which was unfailing, her many qualities quickly developed and were placed at the service of mankind. 

 She constantly thought of others: a little posy of flowers, a small note of love and prayerful thoughts, a timely telephone call to a sick one. In spite of her pouring out love to all, she never once neglected her husband and three children. In this respect her example was a beacon to all: how to both live a full Baha life and pay constant, devoted attention to a wide family circle. 

 The universal love she displayed expressed itself in her desire to share the message of Christ's return with all in a manner which they might understand. To this end her talents as a writer came to her aid. She wrote and broadcast from time to time on several subjects.  She has left us at least four short plays on historical figures of the Baha Faith. In 1976 she recorded her memories in a short work called The Choir Invisible. 

 In this she spoke of her early experiences in Australia, as well as the many extraordinary spiritual happenings which attended her life. Her deep love for children was constant, and her own childlike quality attracted young people of all ages. In 1976 she recorded Stories for 

Childreh                  
 — stories about the Master.

 Despite her very full life, her international relations with Baha'is from many countries is well recognized. 

 She was overjoyed to be able to attend the dedication of the Temples in Kampala and Sydney. 

 While the historic World Congress in London in 1963 left its. loving mark on her soul, she was most inspired by her pilgrimage to the Hoiy Land also in that same year. On the local level she worked for many years for the United Nations Association and will be long remembered in this respect. 

 Her constant cheerfulness throughout all the years uplifted many a struggling soul just when they most needed it. Surely she made 'Heaven flow to earth'. 

 Now, released from this material world, one feels she is soaring in those other climes with which she was often in contact. 

 She is, no doubt, surrounded by that heavenly music she so vividly described hearing  one special night a long time ago.

  Knight of Baha'u'llah     

  Dudley M. Blakely was born in October 1902 and declared his belief in 

Baha'u'llah in 1920. He   

 was ever afterwards a devoted servant of the 

Baha'i Faith. Following   

 in the footsteps of his illustrious aunt, Lua Getsinger, he spread the Message far and wide. 

 His travels took him in the 1930s to the Sudan in Africa and Guyana (formerly 

British Guiana) in South America.2

 In the spring of 1936 he wrote to 1 Lady Blomfield, The Chosen Highway, p. 220.     2 See The Baha'i Centenary: 1844 — 1944, p. 197.

   Dudley Moore Blakely       

  Shoghi Effendi seeking approval of his plan to teach in Latin America with his wife, Elsa. 

 A reply dated 6 March written on behalf of the Guardian expressed Shoghi Effendi's grafifi-cation at the news of this 'projected teaching trip to South America', and remarked that 'the lands you are planning to visit are sQll virgin soils that no Baha'i pioneer has as yet opened to the Faith. 

 You are therefore called upon to undertake the work of a true pioneer.' 

 In a postscript in his own handwriting  the Guardian added, 'I am delighted to learn of your plans and of your determination to serve our beloved Cause in such distant countries and under such difficult circumstances.  You ate often in my thoughts and prayers. May the Almighty, Whose Cause you are serving with such love, fervour and devotion, bless richly your work and fulfil your highest and dearest hopes.' 

 A letter dated 8 April 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi by his secretary records that 'the Guardian is truly delighted to learn of the success of your teaching trip to British Guiana'. 

 There followed years of valuable contributions to the development of the teaching work in Latin America. Between the years 1936 and 1956 the Blakelys were in frequent correspondence with the Guardian, reporting the progress of their teaching efforts and seeking approval of new ventures. 

 In the early phase of th& Ten Year Crusade Dudley and Elsa (or 'Judy' as she is known to her many friends) pioneered to Tonga, earning the title 

Knights of Baha'u'llah.    

 A report sent to the Holy Land in the spnng of 1956 describing the participation of Tongan believers in the teaching work in the islands brought a reply written on the Guardian's behalf on 1 May, stating, 'The Polynesians for many centuries have been admired for their fine characteristics and the nobility of their spirit. It would be a great contribution to the worldwide character of our Faith to have people of this race active in its service and representing what their race has to give, as time goes on, in joint Baha national and international councils. 

 Your services there are very deeply appreciated, and the work you are accomplishing, very dear to his heart:' They settled in Hawaii at the end of the Ten Year Plan, and in September 1977 pioneered to the Bahamas to help prepare the Bahamian Baha'i community for the formation of its first National Spiritual Assembly, but circumstances beyond their control forced them to leave the following February. Dudley was then in his seventy-sixth year. 

 An artist, sculptor and designer by profession, he served as an adviser to the Tongan government. 

 His handiwork can be seen in the several buildings and interiors he designed in the islands. Many such works can also be seen in the United States. He left a legacy of beauty. 

 As a consultant, he produced designs for such diverse items as a small dory for the Department of Fisheries, a pilot boat, a government market, a refrigeration system and buildings for various purposes. He also designed a set of the first gold coins in Polynesia, in 1962, of which two hundred and fifty proof sets were minted. A year earlier he had designed a five-stamp special issue set commemorating mail deliveries to the islands from the era of the fishing boat to that of airmail. He designed Tonga's first decimal coin set in 1965. 

 Dudley Blakely ascended to the AbM Kingdom on 19 December 1982 from his homefront post in St. Simons Island, Georgia,

GULDANIH YIIJSLFI 'ALIPQR 

 1918 — 1982 Mrs. Guldgnih Y6sifi 'Alfp6r, daughter of Fath'alf, was born in 1918 to a Muslim family in the village of Sdd6t Mahallih, situated in the Chah6r D~ngih section of Srtri, which is five kilometres from Rawshank6h, a Baha'i village. About fifty years ago she married Mr. Fatlj'alf 'Alfp6r, a Baha from the village of Kandas Bun, adjacent to Rawshankiih. She developed a great love for the Cause and encouraged her children to be pious and to follow the teachings of the Faith; she even assisted them in the performance of their spiritual obligations, and duties. Her two daughters and one son had Baha'i marriages and have been very staunch and steadfast believers. 

 Mrs. 'Alfp6r enrolled as a Baha'i in 1979. 

 During the disturbances in Kandas Bun which started in the early summer of 1982, the family of Mr. Fath'ali 'Alip6r, and especially this dear lady, led the friends in setting an example, of constancy. 

 Although the instigators and the evildoers were Mrs. 'Alfpiir's nieces, nephews and other relatives, and despite the fact that she was the target of most of the attacks, her family was the last one to leave Kandas Bun. Mrs. 'Alip6r, who was sixty-five years old, and whose back was bent, who walked with a cane and was ~hysica11y frail, was repeatedly beaten, together with her husband, and even dishonoured. 

 At one point their adversaries urinated on them and forced into their mouths a stick covered with human excrement. 

 The essential occupation of the inhabitants of this region is tending cattle. After the afflicted friends were forced to evacuate Kandas Bun they took refuge in Rawshankiih. Mr. Fath'alf 'Alfpiir and his son, 'All, created a temporary pasture for their cattle in G~v Bunih which lies between the two villages. On Friday, 24 December 1982 at about 2:00 p.m. an unknown number of persons hostile to the Faith appeared in 

G4v Bunih, ~trang1ed      

 Gui-dhnih,  and set fire to her body. They burned G4v Bunih and all the forage. 

 They even infficted a wound on a sheep. When the grandson of GuldThih returned from grazing the cattle at 4:00 p.m. he discovered the burnt body of his grandmother and hastened to inform the friends and other members of the fanThy. The incident was reported to the police in KiTyAsar. At noon the next day members of the police force arrived on the scene and, at about 3:00 p.m., the official medical doctor and the interrogator from the Public Prosecutor's office in S4ri. The doctor confirmed that GuldThih 'Aliptir had been strangled prior to being set ablaze and issued S permit for burial. 

 Her body was so burnt, especially the upper part and about the chest, that it was not possible to wash it properly, but a full Baha'i burial was accorded her before she was finally Laid to rest in the Baha'i cemetery of Rawshank6h.

  All those in Europe, Asia and Africa who knew Dr. Amfn'u'116h MisbTh remember having been in contact with an exceptional personality. 

 His deep knowledge of the Faith, his global vision of events, his scientific mind, his literary aptitude and his poetical gifts made of him a man open to every avenue of culture. He was not a public speaker nor an eloquent leader of the multitudes, but rather a fascinating interlocutor whose lucid and intuitive sensibilities inspired in all whom he met a recognition of a reality beyond the moment and beyond material existence, that of the image of Qod which he carried within him. 

 A physician, the confidant of the most intimate sufferings, a member of Assemblies, a witness of the most private individual problems, he was attentive and close to every heart, listening to every person who unburdened himself to him, yet he roused and stirred up these same people in the name of the glorious destiny promised to their souls. 

 All those who came from near pr far to seek his opinion, an elucidation or an explanation and who submitted to him the fruit of their research or a manuscript found him to be of valuable assistance and a source of knowledge.  Never did he avoid answering even at risk of breaking the contact through his complete frankness and the boldness of his remarks: his moral integrity would not brook any compromise. 

 This erudite Persian who had access to the Arab and French cultures, this tormented and lucid poet, this scholar who even at an advanced age~ regarded science with the enthusiasm  and wonderment of an adolescent, consecrated his life to the Baha'i ideal which inspired him. 

 All his life — not easy, monotonous  or banal — was marked and guided by the personality of Shoghi 

Effendi.                   

 Amin'u'116h Misb6h, born in Tihr~n in 1905, came from a family whose maternal and paternal roots go back to the very beginnings of the new Dispensation. 

 His father, 'Azfzu'-11Th Misb6h, director of the Tarbiyat School, was an eminent poet and writer; his mother, Qudsiyyih 'Ah'f, was the sister of the Hand of the Cause 

Shu'A'u'lhh 'AUTh From     

 his earliest years Amin'u'11Th captivated those around him by his literary talents and his scientific gifts. 

 Enamoured of literature and passionately devoted to science, he cultivated these two interests throughout his life, aligning  oriental mysticism to occidental rationalism. 

 After he completed his studies at the Tarbiyat School chance, in the garb of a competitive examination, opened the door to the study in France of biology and medicine. Then, at the Institute of Physiopathology in the Paris Faculty of Medicine, he undertook research on the physiology of the anterior hypophysis. 

 The publications which resulted from his work are, in large part, the source of our understanding of certain diseases of this gland. 

     He married Marie-Jeanne    

 Irady, a French Baha, and started his life with her in 1937 with a pilgrimage to the Holy Land where they met the Guardian. He then returned to fr6n and joined the Faculty of Medicine in Tihr~n as a professor. It was evident that a comfortable and tranquil university career seemed to await him, but such was not the destiny nor the desire of the young couple. 

 In 1942, as soon as Amin and Jeanne heard the Guardian's call for pioneers in the forty-five month Plan assigned to the Baha'i community of fran, they arose and settled with their son in Afghanistan where they remained until 1945, isolated from the world and unable to communicate with anyone, but happy to have been able to respond to the appeal of the Guardian. 

 After persevering for three years, tired, indebted and with the life of their forty-day-old  daughter in jeopardy, they returned to I ran. 

 Amin took up again his teaching position on the Faculty of Medicine and opened a medical practice. 

 He also devoted much energy to the Baha'i Community, serving as a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of TihrTh, of corn

      Jeanne Mesbah             

  mittees, of commissions and of the Board of Directors of Missaghiyeh (Mfthaqfyih) Hospital.  His life and that of his family again appeared to be laid out: intense Baha'i activity and the sustained pursuit of his professional and scientific interests provided material, intellectual and spiritual satisfaction and comfort. 

 Once more the call of the Guardian — the launching of the Ten Year Plan — disrupted the organized pattern of their lives. Without regrets, Amin and Jeanne with their two children abandoned family, friends, school, profession and secure future to throw themselves, as did so many others, into the adventure of the Ten Year Crusade. 

 In Ethiopia, from 1955 to 1959, Amin, while consecrating himself to teaching the Faith, carried on his profession and obtained the position of military doctor in Asmara. In Morocco, from 1959 to 1969, he was chief physician of the anatomopathology laboratory. 

 And finally, in France, at the service of ihe 

International Pioneer     

 Committee of the United States, be took advantage of his retirement. During his last ten years, at the / 

       Amine Mesbah              

  suggestion of the Universal House of Justice, he conducted historical research in Paris at the National Library and in the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which brought to light material that has already sewed historians of the Faith. 

 This itinerant life (never more than ten years in one place), this life with no rest (for he was always at the service of the ill and was active in Baha'i teaching activities), was for Amin a source of inexhaustible enrichment and of poetic inspiration, for he was one of those who offer humanity, in the form of an enduring work, the fruit of every ordeal and joy. his literary work consists primarily of poems inspired by the events of the moment, happy or sad, and dedicated to his venerated parents, to his dear wife, to his children and grandchildren, or to the launching of the Ten Year Crusade, to the conquests of the pioneers, to the glory of the Guardian or in honour of the establishment of the Universal House of Justice. During the last period of his life he laboured relentlessly on the epic task of writing the history of the Baha'i Faith in


<p814>
814                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  verse. He had ardently hoped to finish this work, but on 29 December 1982, when he was in full possession of his physical and intellectual forces, a cerebral haemorrhage carried him off leaving his friends, his family and in particular his wife, Jeanne, in profound dismay. 

 Their destinies had been so intimately linked that his companion and partner in a life he laboured relentlessly on the epic task of writing the history of the Baha'i Faith in the Abhd Kingdom a scant three-and-a-half months later on 14 April 1983. 

 Forty-seven years of life together had welded inseparably these two beings, so different and so complementary. 

 In contrast to Amin who had tormented and hidden depths, Jeanne was elegant, fascinating,  enchanting and lively, and travelled through life like a ray of sunshine. 

 Armed with her bright and sparkling smile, her polished speech and her refined manners she set out to conquer the most morose dispositions  and the most reticent hearts; she faced ticklish situations with equanimity and was at ease in the drawing-rooms of the great of this world. 

 She was born on 27 March 1909 to a Catholic family in Biarritz, a Basque area, where traditions and values seemed fixed for eternity. Asa child she aspired to a secure and tranquil life without surprises, but a serious and protracted illness at an early age led her to reflect and meditate upon life and death. As a student in Paris she accepted the Baha'i Faith through May Maxwell and frequented the homes of such early Baha'is as 

Mine Dreyfus-Barney, Miss  
Edith Sanderson and Mine   

 Scott. She met Amin in the Baha'i meetings and found herself, as a result of her marriage, embarked upon an epic adventure. 'You must be proud to belong to the Mi~b4i family,' the Guardian told her in the early days of her married life. She found herself in IrAn, a young and inexperienced Baha'i, a refined and emancipated woman in the grip of foreign customs; but Amfn's family welcomed her, and her sincerity and radiance opened many doors and won for her acceptance and love. Later she found herself pioneering — she who had nothing of the adventurer in her —  not hesitating to encourage or support her husband in hazardous enterprises or to enlist his energetic aid in projects in which she was sure she could succeed. 

 Having proved herself and gained confidence by serving on various committees in IrAn and particularly on the East — West Committee,  she continued to serve wherever she found herself. She was a member of the Regional Assembly of Northeast Africa. 

 She travelled, using her natural charm and her ease of expression (in French, English, Persian and Italian) to meet and jhterest people. Always she represented the Faith with dignity. She was in touch with the authorities in Djibouti, then a French dependency, gave French lessons to the daughter of the king (Negus) of Ethiopia, became secretary to the viceroy in Eritrea, and the President of the Alliance Fran~aise in 

Asmara. The Guardian       

 pointed out to her in 1953 that he had. inscribed the Basque country on the map of the Ten Year Plan. 

 Proud of being the first Basque Baha'i Jeanne, following Shoghi Effendi's instructions,  had a text of Baha'u'llah translated by the Director of the Basque museum in Bayonne. 

 Jeanne took pleasure in measuring the path she had followed since accepting the Faith. She, who had struggled so much, communicated a~ climate of peace, of quietude and of certitude. 

 She had an expansive nature and could listen for hours to complaints and sighs; she knew how to comfort the saddest soul. 

 Amin and Jeanne spent the last years of their lives near their children in France in an Alsatian village called Hegenheim on the borders of three countries, France, Switzerland and Germany: After a full life they took their flight to the Abhd Kingdom. 

 Even their departure provided opportunity to proclaim, as the local newspaper reported, that the fate of humanity depends upon its acceptance of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.

  Dr. Cobb passed away at age one hundred and one in his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland,  on 29 December 1982, having achieved his ambition to live for a full century. 

 During the final weeks of his life he often referred to his last meeting with 'Abdu'l-Baha which occurred in Washington: He embraced me at the end, kissed me, and said three times, Be on fire with the love of the Kingdom!' Stanwood Cobb was indeed on fire with the love of the Kingdom to his last breath after some seventy-five years of service to the Baha'i 

Faith.                     

 To review Dr. Cobb's life is to make a 

      Stanwood Cobb              

 beautiful and heavenly journey through those marvellous years beginning with the early dawn of the Baha'i Faith in the United States when news of this 'new Revelation' and of the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Holy Land reached the ears of a few 'ready souls', aroused their curiosity, quickened their hearts and resulted in their making their way to 'Akka in an ever-increasing stream to enter the Master's presence. 

 An account of Dr. Cobb's introduction to the Baha'i Faith in 1906 is given in his Memories of Abdu'l-Baha and in Star of the West, Vol. 15, No. 1, April 1924: He was at that time studying for the Unitarian ministry at the Harvard Divinity School but was drawn to Green Acre in Maine as a result of a series of weekly articles in the Boston Transcript. Miss Sarah Farmer introduced Dr. Cobb to the singer, Mary Lucas, who had just returned from visiting 'Abdu'l-Baha. '. within half an hour from that moment I became a confirmed Baha'i and have remained so ever since,' Dr. Cobb wrote. 

 After graduating from Dartmouth College and taking an MA. in philosophy and comparative  religion at Harvard, Dr. Cobb served as an instructor at Robert College in Constantinople  from 1907 to 1910, an experience that led to the publication of his first book The Real Turk. During this interval Dr. Cobb met 'Abdu'l-Baha on two occasions. The first meeting was in 1908 when 'Abdu'l-Baha was still a prisoner of the Turks. 

 On this occasion the pilgrim disguised himself as a Turk in order to attain the Master's presence, spending  several days as a guest in His home in 'Akka. Mrs. Lua Getsinger, whom Dr. Cobb had encountered by chance in Cairo, had encouraged him to accompany her on this most significant of jobrneys. 

 'Again it was my privilege to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha in the summer of 1910,' writes Dr. Cobb, 'and this time at His own invitation •spending a week there in the Persian guest house on the slopes of Mt. 

Carmel.                    

 He se&med to me more noble in countenance more regal in bearing, mote potent in the power of His presence than ever before.' 

 Later Dr. Cobb was to again enter the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha in France and in the United States during the course of the Master's historic travels. Dr. Cobb related


<p816>

  that while teaching at Robert College he suffered severe depression. During the course of one of his visits to the• Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha  took him aside, held his hand and sat with him quietly. 

 The depression lifted and never returned. Indeed, sunniness of disposition, cheerfulness of outlook and un-comphining  acceptance became Stanwood Cobb's outstanding characteristics. 
   He returned to the United  

States from Constantinople 

 to pursue a career in education and writing. 

 lie published approximately twenty books on religion, education and philosophy, and several volumes of verse. He made his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, where, in 1918, he organized the Progressive Education Association which has exerted a profound influence on education in the United States. He established the Chevy Chase Country Day School where he was able to put into effect his ideas about education. 

 His wife, Nayam Whitlam, a Canadian Baha'i, was of considerable assistance in this activity until their retirement in 1958. 

 In 1935 Dr. Cobb founded Avalon Press through which he published his works. 

 Some of his better known publications that deal with the principles of the Baha'i Faith are 

Security for a Failing     
World, Tomorrow and Tomorrow, Isldm's

Contribution to Civilization

 and the pamphlet America's Spiritual Destiny. Among his books dealing with the development of the individual are Discovering the Genius Within You — a book which proved very popular —  and 

Character: A Sequence      
in Spiritual-Psy-  chology.

His autobiography, Saga:   

 A Tale of Two Centuries, appeared in 1977. 

 In 1924 Dr. Cobb was invited to serve as editor of Star of the West and until 1939 he acted as coeditor of its successor, World Order, with various distinguished Baha'is including 

Mariam Haney, Horace       
Holley, Edna True and      

Jinjb-i-F~idi1. Almost     

 every issue of this pub1i~ation carries an editorial signed or initialled by Dr. Cobb on a large variety of significant topics reflecting his wide range of interests. He was a popular lecturer on the Faith at public functions and informal firesides and a sought-after teacher at Summer Schools. To the end of his life he possessed an amazing memory for names, dates, places and historical facts, and seldom if ever used notes when giving an address. 

 He kept well informed about current events and world affairs. 

 He was a member of the Spiritual Assembly of Washington, D.C., at the time of its incorporation in 1933, and until his one hundredth birthday frequently lectured at the weekly public meetings held at the Baha'i Centre there. He mingled with noted authors at the Washington Cosmos Club of which he was a member, and had many distinguished friends among the clergy. 

 Shoghi Effendi warmly appreciated Dr. Cobb's services to the Faith as the following excerpt, appended in the Guardian's hand to a letter written on his behalf on 5 September 1943, attests: Your services to our belo.ved Faith have been such as to reflect lustre on its institutions and literature, and I pray from the depths of my heart that Baha'u'llah may graciously guide and assist you to render through your able and ready pen still greater and more distinguished services.' 

 Although content with a simple life style, Dr. Cobb was a highly cultivated person and had a taste for the arts. He believed strongly in and greatly valued the power of prayer, and many of his friends would come to ask for prayers on their behalf. Often he could be seen sitting on his porch at Chevy Chase or on the screened veranda at Green Acre meditating and supplicating on behalf of loved ones. Young people sought him out and he was something of the 'wise man' in our midst. He loved youth and had great faith in their potential. 

 Always he urged them to immerse themselves in the Teachings, acquire spiritual virtues and — in the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha —  Be on fire with the love of the Kingdom! He was a happy man and whatev~r he did seemed to be achieved without stress, strain or struggle. Vigorous and young at heart, he was a frequent guest at youth conferences. 

 Dr. Cobb's passing to the eternal realm robs us of yet another priceless link with the early period in the rise of the Baha'i Faith when seekers hastened into the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha and returned home to• inspire others with the Glad Tidings and to strive zealously to lay the foundations of the burgeoning  World 

Order of Baha'u'llah.

  They that have forsaken their country in the path of God and subsequently ascended unto His presence, such souls shall be blessed by the Concourse on High and their names recorded by the Pen of Glory among such as have laid down their lives as martyrs in the path of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsistent. 

  The above words of the Blessed Beauty apply to 

Mirza Aq~ Kh~in Kam~1i-Sarvist~inf.

 Early in the Ten Year Crusade he opened the island of Socotra to the Faith, for which service he was named by the beloved 

Guardian a Knight of Baha'u'llah.

 In letters written on Shoghi Effendi's behalf it was stated that the Guardian  was praying for the accomplishment of the difficult task Mr. Kam~iIf had undertaken and that he expressed deep appreciation for his sacrificial services. The bounty of receiving such loving and encouraging messages delighted  Mr. Kam~1i's heart, rejoiced his spirit and further enkindled his eagerness to serve the 

Cause.                     

 Mr. Kam~t1i was born in June 1924 in Sarvist~n, a town in F6rs Province, fr~jn. During the thirty years he spent in the Arabic-speaking  countries in which he chose to serve he was a source of encouragement and inspiration  for his fellow pioneers. He was a knowledgeable and popular teacher at the Baha'i Summer Schools where he conducted classes for the youth on the history and principles of the Faith. How eager he was to be at his pioneering post when it came time to leave this mortal life! 

 The day after his passing on 1 February 1983, friends from many Baha'i centres gathered to honour him, their hearts filled with love for this departed friend. 

 The dignity and serenity which were characteristic of Mr. Kam~1f during his earthly life and which reflected his qualities of resignation and contentment  were visible in his beautiful countenance  after his death. It was a glorious funeral service, befitting that devoted and faithful servant of Baha'u'llah, and bringing comfort to his family and friends in their Loss. 

 The services of Mr. Kam~Lf were crowned by the cable received from the Un~versaI House of Justice on 23 February:

 1922 — 1983 On Sunday, 10 April 1983, members of the Baha'i community of Haarlem, the Netherlands,  gathered to remember their departed friend and to pray for his soul in the Abh~i Kingdom. 

 The news of Bob van Lith's passing was totally unexpected for most, who were grateful for the assurance given by his son-in-law,  Hugo van Boihuis, that Bob had not suffered from his illness, and had passed away in peace, deeply trusting in the Faith, with his wife, Marijke, and his daughters, Patricia,

  Bob van Lith, together with his wife Ma-rijke, accepted the Baha'i Faith in January 1952. From that moment on he served the Cause of Baha'u'llah, offering his talents and Jacob Eduard (Bab) van 

Lit/i                      

 strengths in all fields of the work of the ever-expanding Baha'i community. 

 From its inception, he' was a member of the Baha Benelux Committee, and afterwards served on the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the Baha'is of the Benelux which came into being in 1957. When, in 1962, each of these countries 

(Belgium, the Netherlands  

 and Luxembourg) formed its own National Spiritual Assembly, he served on the Dutch National Spiritual Assembly and was chairman until he left the country. 

    In 1975 Bob and Marijke    

 responded to the call of the Universal House of Justice for pioneers. 

 Thiee of their children accompanied them to their chosen goal of Suriname, while the others stayed behind in the Netherlands. 

 Bob was devoted to the Faith, faithfully fulfilling the duties and obligations he was given, always supported by his Marijke. Every week presented a full round of meetings, committees, study classes. In addition he held an exacting job as a lawyer and an insurance assessor, not to mention his responsibilities towards his growing family. It was a richly blessed family, a hospitable house, a home with magnetic appeal for young and old. Bob's character left its mark on family and friends and on the various parts of the Baha'i community which he served. He was a born chairman, with attention for everything and everyone, with much patience, much wisdom and especially much humour, with a perfect sense of timing, always acting at the right moment, always to the point, and never hurtful, never causing pain. You could talk to him about yourself, but not about others; the word 'gossip' was not in his vocabulary. 

 He was also an example in the way he was able to separate and confine to its proper sphere such diverse activities as Local Assembly matters, professional and management concerns and personal affairs. 

 It was, perhaps, his qualities of patience and courtesy which, above others, endeared him to the friends. 
Now God has called him to  

Himself. How brave Marijke 

 is, and how faithful and resigned; she needs our prayers and our support.

  Elizabeth Idang Njang      
                           
  ELIZABETH IDANG NJANG      

 1928 — 1983  

Elizabeth Idang Njang      

 was born on 30 July 1928 in a village near Calabar in Nigeria. Having lost her parents at a tender age, she was raised by relatives and became a dedicated member of the Church of Christ. Her first marriage, to a man who developed a serious drinking problem, was doomed to failure. However, a son born of this union eventually embraced the Baha'i Faith, serving as a Local Spiritual Assembly secretary before his death in the Nigerian civil war. 

 In 1956 Mrs. Njang met her future husband, Mr. 0. E. Njang, who is at present a member of the 

Auxiliary Board in Nigeria.

 They were both attending a ceremony at which palm wine, the traditional alcoholic beverage, was being served. 

 She noticed that he alone was abstaining from the drink. Her curiosity about the Faith was aroused as she heard him telling others about Baha'u'llah. She began to attend deepening sessions conducted by Mr. Njang ~and three other friends. Within a year she embraced the Faith and returned to her former church where she audaciously announced to the congregation that Christ had returned in the Glory of the Father. 

 This event, while earning her an immediate expulsion from the church, marked the beginning of a quarter century of dedicated service to the Baha'i Cause. 

 In 1958 Mrs. Njang. was appointed a full-time teacher by the then National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa and in the same year she and her husband brought the Message of Baha'u'llah to the Ejagham tribe in southeastern Nigeria. Finally, at the Annual Convention in Victoria, Western Cameroon, in 1960, she so impressed the delegates with her devotion and dynamism that the attending Hands of the Cause of God referred to her as 'the T6hirih of Nigeria'. 
     She was elected to the     

National Spiritual Assembly

 of West Central Africa in 1967. Prior to this she had served as chairman of the National Teaching Committee of the Baha'is of Nigeria and as Local Spiritual Assembly chairman for many year;. In 1979 she organized  a Baha'i women's conference in the Calabar-Mamfe area which was attended by more than one hundred Baha'i women. 

    Eventually Mrs. Njang      

 decided to return to her home village to engage in farming to help feed her orphaned grandchildren and to deepen three new Local Spiritual Assemblies in the area. Finally, on 17 March 1983, she passed away after a brief illness and was laid to rest in the presence of approximately one hundred of the friends. 

 In a country where the ministry is frequently viewed as a means of attaining material enrichment, Mrs. Njang was often ridiculed for being a 'woman pastor' of a 'church' which did not remunerate its workers. 

 She would reply to such derision by explaining that she and her husband were in reality the wealthy ones; although perhaps not in a material sense. On a continent where women are oniy beginning to develop their latent potentialities she is remembered as an outstanding example for the Baha'i women of Africa, and elsewhere,  to emulate. 

 On learning of Mrs. Njang's death the Universal House of Justice sent the following cable to the National Spiritual Assembly of Nigeria on 

28 March 1983:

       SHARON RICKEY KAZEMI (KAZIMI)

 1949 — 1983 Sharon Rickey, daughter of Horace B. Rickey Jr. and Jewel Katherine Seybold, was born in Lafayette, Louisiana. She attended 

Hamilton  School, Chateau

 Mon Choisi, Lausanne, Switzerland, and graduated as a National Merit 

Scholar from Lafayette    

 High School. She received a B.A. in English literature from Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont, and her Master's and D.E.D. degrees in African literature from the University of Abidjan. 

 Before becoming a Baha'i, Sharon was active in many civic organizations, as a Girl Scout leader and as a Red Cross worker, and she performed valuable services on several committees of the First Presbyterian Church of Lafayette. She was interested in musical and theatrical presentations as evidenced  by her membership in the Middlebury College Choir, and by her association with and participation in a number of plays and musicals both in Vermont and in Louisiana where she played the lead in a production of My Fair Lady. In sports, she became a champion fencer, and she achieved a measure of public notice as the State secretary of the 'Young Republicans'. She was brought up in a religious family. Her parents, staunch Christians,  taught her the equality of men without distinction as to race or religion. 

 When at the age of twenty she became acquainted with the Baha'i Faith, the new Revelation was the embodiment of the spiritual truths she had been taught. 

 Sharon's varied activities at Middlebury College ultimately led her into contact with a Baha who proceeded to explain to her the spiritual realities of Baha'u'llah's divine economy.  She faced each principle determined to prove it wrong; yet after each bout, returned / 

Sharon Rickey Kazemi (Kdzimi)

  convinced and ready to argue another point. It was during an adult Christian baptism in the College Chapel that she realized that her answer was not in partisan politics in which she had been so active but in that divine polity being built by Baha'u'llah's followers. 

 That very day she declared her belief with characteristic bravado, rushing into the room of her Baha'i friend and demanding enrollment on the spot. 

 Hers had been the real 'baptism'. Sharon retired from her political connections as time and opportunity permitted. She worked assiduously over the next two years to allay the fears of relatives and friends who believed that she had been misled. Some of their misgivings  were softened when Sharon's great-aunt  remarked, 'I heard 'Abdu'l-Baha speak in 1912. There is nothing wrong with Sharon's being a Baha'i. Any religion which, has 'Abdu'l-Baha is good.' 

 In 1972 Sharon pioneered to the Ivory Coast where, in the same year2 she married Zek-rullah  Kazemi 

(Dhikru'11Th Khzimf)      
whose appointment to the  

Continental Board of Counsellors

 was announced in May 1973. Her dynamic enthusiasm and vitality inspired all who met her. For several years she was a member and secretary of the 

National Spin


<p821>
IN MEMORIAM               821

  tual Assembly of the Ivory 

Coast, Mali and Upper      

 Volta. She also performed sterling service as a member of a number of national comm~ttees including the National Women's Committee and the National Teaching Committee  of which she was secretary. From 1974 to 1979 she labored diligently as secretary in the office of the Continental Board of Counsellors  for West Africa. She served at the same time and until the end of her life as member-at-large of the Continental Pioneering Committee for Africa, as well as performing additional services for the Continental Board and in translation work. 

 During part of her pioneering career, she relocated to the northern areas of the Ivory Coast, areas which have seen dramatic increases in numbers of Baha'i believers. 

 Besides her work for the Baha'i Faith, Sharon was equally energetic in other activities. She taught English at Bingerville High School, at the Center for AudioVisual Research and Studies, and in the English Department of the Ufiiversity of Abidjan. 

 She also served as an interpreter with a number of organizations. She was a member of the Ensemble Vocal d'Abidjan, a wellknown choir in the Ivory Coast. 

 She was at the same time preparing her doctoral thesis in African literature. 

 Her passion was teaching the Faith and she did not hesitate to sacrifice her health and life for this noble aim. For her, to be a pioneer meant to stay in the pioneering post until the end of one's life. For this reason she wished to die and be buried in Africa. 

 It was a wish that was, alas, prematurely realized. 

 In March 1983 she contracted severe amoebiasis which attacked her body already weakened by chronic diabetes. 

 At dawn on 4 April her pure soul winged its ffight to the Abh6 Kingdom. Her earthly remains were buried at Niangon-Attic close to the site of 

Ivory Coast's future Baha'i

 Temple. Sharon is survived by her husband; her parents; two children, Jaleh Katherine and Ryan; and two sisters, 

Marjorie  Rickey and Priscilla

 Rickey Forest. At her passing these cablegrams were addressed to her family on 5 April:

  A subsequent cable dated 8 April offered the consolation of the assurance of continued prayers by the Universal House of Justice for the progress of Sharon's 'radiant soul'. 

 Sharon's knowledge of the lloiy Writihgs, her sharp memory and her genial intelligence made her a rare asset to the Baha'i community of West Africa. Her loss was deeply felt, for she was at once a strengthening and stabilizing influence in the administrative institutions of the Ivory Coast, and a beloved teacher who won the hearts of many to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. And more than this, she proved herself a true friend, always ready to extend that Baha'i friendship which is the hallmark of those who have truly imbibed the teachings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 It is in her acts of generosity, unfeigned fellowship, and pure love that Sharon Kazemi lives in the hearts of those who knew her. Her services and untainted life must surely find an honored place in the annals of the Cause of God in the African continent.

  Doris Holley, whose maiden name was Pascal, was born in London on 14 August 1894. She had two brothers and a sister. Her father was a concert pianist. 

 Always a seeker of truth, he became, in turn, a 

Swedenborgian and a Christian

 Scientist. Her mother was not much interested in religion and considered it an unsuitable subject of conversation. When Doris was five years old, her parents moved to the United 

States of America. Four    

 years later, while her father remained in a boarding house in New Rochelle, New York, her mother took the children to live in Barbados, West 

Indies.                    

 While she was growing up, Doris liked to get off by herself and read. 

 When she reached sixteen her mother said to her, 'I will find some way of making you do as I wish.' Doris 

       Doris Holley               

 then resolved to leave home as soon as she could. 

 In the autumn of 1912 her mother sent Doris to Paris to study for a year. On her arrival there Doris said to the woman who had agreed to look after her, 'Mother told me that I was not to go out alone in Paris.' 

 The woman replied with amusement, 'Does your mother expect me to engage a nanny to take care of you?' 

 One morning in February 1913, a month after 'Abdu'l-Baha had arrived in Paris to start His second visit to that city, Doris heard Him address a meeting at the home of Hippolyte and Laura Dreyfus-Barney. 

 Although  she had already heard His name from Juliet Thompson, she did not realize who He was and knew nothing about the Baha'i Cause. Doris has said of this, 'I was spiritually asleep at the time, but while I was listening to the Master's talk I felt as if Jesus were speaking and I thought that the Master was saying what Jesus would have said. When the meeting was over, instead of following the Master out of the room as the others in the audience had done, I remained in my chair. The Master soon returned. 

 To my natural astonishment He walked straight up to me and kissed me on the forehead. I still did not recognize who He was.' Ironically, Horace Holley and his wife, Bertha, attended this meeting with their child, Hertha. Doris had not seen them before nor were they introduced on that occasion. 

 Some weeks after the start of the First World War, in the autumn of 1914, Doris moved to London and several months later sailed for New York City. After Horace Holley's marriage had foundered he and Doris became friends. Doris has remarked, 'The first time that I saw Horace alone, I thought that our marriage was to be; I married Horace because I liked him, not because he was a Baha'i' Doris attended some Baha meetings with Horace. She explained, 'I just gradually learned more about the Cause until I realized that I had become a Baha'i.' 

In September 1919 Horace   
and Doris were married.    

 About a year later she lost her oniy child at birth. 

 In the spring of 1925, assured by the National Assembly that such a move would be of much assistance to the B~ihd'f community, Horace resigned from his position at the

 to devote all his time to secretarial work for the Assembly. Although he and Doris occasionally received help by means of modest inheritances, most of their support for the rest of Horace's life came from the Baha'i Fund. It cannot have been easy for either of them to accept regular support from this source. That their action would be bountifully blessed finds assurance in Shoghi Effendi's response of 24 October 1925: 'I rejoice to learn that ways and means have been found to enable the National secretary, who discharges in such an exemplary  Manner the manifold and exacting duties of a highly responsible position, to devote all his time to the pursuit of so meritorious a task. I am fully conscious of the privations and sacrifice which the choice of this arduous work must involve for him, as well as for his devoted and selfless companion; I cannot but admire and extol their heroic efforts, and wish to assure them both of my continued prayers for the speedy fruition of their earnest endeavours." 

 For the first twenty years of their married life, except for part of each summer when they occupied a cottage of their own at Green Acre, the Baha'i School in Eliot, Maine, the Holleys lived in New York City. Although they were happy there, when they realized that the Guardian wanted 'the spiritual and administrative centre to be fused into one', they made plans to change their residence to Wilmette, Illinois.

 breaks in their meetings at the national Llazfratu'I-Quds, and also entertained numerous  visitors to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 Early in 1944 Horace had his first serious illness. 

 Although he recovered and remained in fairly good health until 1949, he was not very well for the rest of his life. 

 When Doris was asked whether it was difficult to take care of him, she said, 'No, I always felt that Baha'u'llah was taking care of him. 

 Besides that, Horace always felt that whatever I did was right.' 

 In his message of 24 December 1951 the Guardian announced to the Baha'i world the appointment of the first contingent of Hands of the Cause, twelve in number. Horace was one of the three elevated to that rank on the North American continent.3 

 Two years and a day after the passing of the Guardian in the early hours of 4 November 1957, immediately following their third Conclave, the Hands of the Cause announced their selection of Horace for service in the Holy Land. Horace and Doris reached Haifa on the last day of 1959; Horace passed away there on 12 July 1960. After his death Doris remained in Haifa for a year and kept house for the nine Hands who were serving there, ~and then began her life as a pioneer. 

 In November 1961 she settled in Neuchatel, Switzerland, and seven years later she moved to Lausanne. 

 She pioneered for almost a decade in Switzerland. 

 In her letter of 13 May 1983 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Republic of Ireland, Counsellor Agnes Ghaz-navi  wrote, 'In spite of the great difference of age, Doris was a very near and dear friend, both to my husband, Bijan, and to myself. Doris had a special quality of understanding people in their difficulties and of using her keen intellect for piercing mysteries in human lives ~ She is also remembered for her delightful sense of humour that never failed her during her long and distinguished career of service to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Just before she left Switzerland, when it became apparent that her hearing was failing, Doris wrote to a friend announcing her decision to settle in Ireland and remarking wryly that she

  might find it easier to be hard of hearing in English than in French. 

 Early in the summer of 1971 Doris moved to Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. 

 During her early months there she was thrilled to find that a large number of young people were becoming attracted to the Faith. 

 In a warm, sensitive and understanding manner she taught and helped each person with whom she became acquainted. 

 Baha'is throughout Ireland, both north and south, had the opportunity  of getting to know Doris and of listening to her valuable remarks about the Baha'i Revelation during the four years she spent in Limerick. 

 The young people who flocked to her confided in the Hand of the Cause of God Rahmatu'lHh Mirza, 'We cannot talk to our parents, but we can talk to Doris. The age difference is of no importance to us.' In order to save the Local Spiritual Assembly  of Dun Laoghaire from lapsing, Doris moved there just before RiQv~n 1976. Two years later she transferred her residence to Dublin. 

 In February 1980, after visiting Connecticut for several months, she returned to Ireland and, for the purpose of serving on the Spiritual Assembly of County Wicklow, found a room for herself in a comfortable home in Greystones. 

 A little more than a year before her passing on 4 April 1983, to enable her close friends to reach her without delay if she needed them, Doris lived in a home in Dun Laoghaire, where she was treated with much kindness and consideration. During the last weeks of her life she said happily to some of us, 'I fed that Horace is with me every night.' 

 Four days after her passing, on a bright, clear Friday afternoon, a moving funeral service was held in the chapel of Deansgrange Cemetery, near Dublin. More than fifty people were in attendance, a few of whom were not members of the Baha'i community. 

 On this occasion — joyful, yet tinged with sadness — I was privileged to read a poem which Doris had written in 1935: Let us want everything and nothing, And oniy that elusive fire That burns our wayward consciousness Into the flow of Thy desire; That melts the metal of our minds From separate sparks to liquid flamc And lights the Inner Light; And melts in tears the veil that hides from sight The path — the home — the end —  That is Thy Name.1

  Arnold Zonnevelci was born in Haarlem, the Netherlands, on 30 March 1933 and died in Cochabamba, Bolivia, on 13 April 1983. This exceptional Baha'i of Dutch background was known to very few of his fellow Dutch believers, for barely one year of his twenty-three  years of life as a Baha'i was spent in his home country. 

 Arnold was the example of a born pioneer: he gave Up everything in order to settle in the most inhospitable places where he lived in primitive circumstances and devoted himself to the spiritual and physical wellbeing of his fellow man. Whether he had to endure bitter cold or terriNe heat, whether alone and unmarried or responsible for a large family, Arnold understood the art of being satisfied under all conditions. 

 We can rightly call him a true servant of God. 
   He was introduced to the  

Baha'i Faith by Arnoki   

 van Ogtrop, and in 1961, while attending the International 

Summer School for Youth   

 in Deift, the Netherlands, he met Paul Adams, the 

Knight of Baha'u'llah      

 for Spitsbergen, and heard his account of life in that barren arctic region. 
Arnold decided to join    

Paul in Spitsbergen.      

 He served there for three years, working as a hunter and later in coal-mines. 

 The rigorous climate and hard working conditions affected his health and he 1 World Order, vol. I, No. 9, p. 354,

     Arnold Zonneveld          

  had to leave. He returned to Germany and in 1965 married Gisela von Brunn. 

 The following  year, inspired by the talks given by Anna Grossmann at the German Summer School, they resolved to pioneer to 

Latin America. Bolivia    

 seemed to offer the opportunity they sought to actively spread the teachings of Baha'u'llah among a receptive population. On 21 November 1966 they arrived in South America with their one-year-old son, Hilmar, and soon settled in Cochabamba. 

 Arnold's capacity to take up whatever work was available proved especially useful. He took on many projects — woodworking, business, agriculture, cattle breeding — and earned a wide reputation as a trustworthy and competent workman. It was not always a simple matter to earn a livelihood for his growing family and he suffered many setbacks.  They received great moral and practical support from Gisela's mother, Ursula von Brunn, who joined them in Cochabamba in September 1967. 

 The Zonnevelds settled in the centre of the tropical jungle and savannah area, in the Department of Beni, where they located on a piece of land on the Rio Blanco and gave their home the name El AiIm (Dawn). El Aiba served well as a pioneer post because seven of the eight provinces of Beni can be reached by rivers, there being virtually no roads or other amenities. 

 Equally important, there is a city in the area, Costa Marques, Brazil. 

 There were no Western comforts which meant that basic daily needs occupied a great deal of time, a circumstance which they deeply regretted. The Zonneveld family, which eventually numbered six children, adopted the local way of life as their own. Lumber was difficult to obtain. Although he had never thought he had a talent for technical things, Arnold developed two different guide-systems for chain-saws  and began to fell trees and to saw planks. The sale of quality planks became the primary source of income for the family. 

 Their way of life aroused admiration and astonishment on the part of the native people and visitors alike. 

 But the Zonnevelds found no solution to the problem of how to free themselves to devote more time to the Baha'i Faith and to projects that would improve the living conditions of the local people. 

 It was their dearest wish to establish first a primary school and later a trade school for the region, but their appeals for others to join them in the area and lend assistance went unanswered. 

 Early in 1983 Arnold fell ill. After a long bout of malaria it was discovered that he had a brain tumour which had already developed beyond the stage where it could be treated. On 13 April 1983 he passed away peacefully in the presence of his wife and their two oldest children, supported by the prayers of the Baha'is of Cochabamba and other centres. This servant of the Cause of God devoted himself to the service of a special race of people of whom he was very fond. Often the task seemed beyond his strength. His family prays that the effort expended in Cochabamba be not lost and that the promise of success be fully realized. 

 May we remember in our prayers the one who has passed away and also those who live after him.

838                  THE BAHA'I WORLD
  6. LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
       ACHIEVEMENTS
                Ridvan 1979 — Ridvan 1983

  PREVIOUS volumes of The Baha'i World list more than 650 languages, major dialects and scripts into which the Sacred Writings and other literature of the Baha'i Faith have been translated; the total number has now reached more than 725. The promotion of such translations has been an important objective of the international teaching plans conducted by the Bah&Pworld community over the years, with the purpose of making available to the believers in many lands the Scriptures of their faith in their own tongues. Information about the languages in which Baha'i literature is currently available may be obtained from the Baha'i World Centre, P3. Box 155, 31 001 Haifa, Israel. 

 Listed below, in alphabetical order by continent of origin, are the languages, dialects and scripts in which translations of Baha'i literature have definitely been made, whether for the first time or enriching available literature, during the period between Ridvan 1979 and Ridvan 1983. 

 These accomplishments include translations, publications and recordings on tape, although not all have been achieved in each of the languages named. Literature in each dialect and each different script has been treated as a separate achievement, as each is assumed to reach a different public. This is a minimum listing; other reports, some elements of which are still ambiguous, remain under investigation. 

 Usage and spelling chosen for primary listings and indication of dialect relationships follow, where possible, C. F. and F. M. Voegelin, Classification and Index of the World's Languages,1 even when this differs from generally recognized usage or that of the speakers themselves. 

 Some variant names and spellings, including variants previously reported, appear in parentheses; listings in quotation marks (' ')have not yet been identified from this reference, or there is some ambiguity regarding exact identification. 

 The major countries, islands or territories where the languages are spoken are shown in italics. Where no such entry is given, the language is spoken in so many widely scattered territories that to list them would be unwieldy; many of these languages are found worldwide. 

 Languages officially used in countries in more than one continent are grouped separately at the head of the list. 

 The number of languages, dialects and scripts listed here as achievements of the Plan to date total 334. Of these, 66 are new languages, dialects or scripts never before reported, and 17 others may also prove to be new when accurate identification or date of achievement has been established.

    7. TRANSLATIONS OF THE SHORT OBLIGATORY
                     PRAYER

                 Short Daily Obligatory Prayer in Arabic and English.

  A. BOVE is the original Arabic with its translation into English of one of the prayers revealed by Baha'u'llah and prescribed for fulfilment of the daily obligatory prayer. It is known as the Short Obligatory Prayer, and when used is recited once in twenty-four hours, at noon. 

 In previous volumes of The Baha'i World translations of this prayer were published in almost 400 languages, dialects or scripts. These are listed below, by continent, with corrected designations where possible, followed by the texts of new or improved translations which became available in the period Ridvan 1979 — 1983, bringing the total to 501. In some instances identification is provisional, and in others alternative translations may appear pending final approval of the relevant National Spiritual Assemblies. Not all the Braille texts available are shown. There exist some oral translations made on tape recordings which are not reflected in these pages. 

 The usage and spelling chosen for primary listings, and indication of dialect relationships, follow, where possible, C. F. and F. M. Voegelin, Classification and Index of the World's Languages. It is recognized by the compilers of this list that these designations, therefore, sometimes do not reflect the name by which a particular language or dialect is best known, or the designation preferred by those who speak it. Some varialit flames and spellings, including variants previously reported, appear in parentheses.


<p847>
BAHA'I' BIBLIOGRAPHY          847

  Exceptions to Voegelin & Voegelin's usage have been made in a few cases: where the name of a language has been officially changed in the country in which it is spoken; where Voegelin & Voegelin's primary listing is known to be considered pejorative by speakers of the language or dialect; and in a few other instances. Also, certain of the European dialects of Scandinavian and Netherlandic-German have been listed as separate languages, on the basis of their long separate histories as literary languages.

     8. A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE WORKS
           ON THE BAHA'I FAITH: SELECTIONS
           Compiled by William P. Collins

             Baha'i World Centre Library

                    INTRODUCTION

  A NUMBER of attempts have been made to compile a bibliographic record of Baha literature and published references to the Baha'i Faith. Of particular interest are the entries in the 'Baha'i Bibliography' section in successive volumes of The Baha'i World from volume I, 1925 — 1926 (called The Baha'i Year Book), through volume XVI, 1973 — 1976. Volume XVII, 1976 — 1979,     of that reference work included valuable contributions by Robert Cadwalader and Maureen Thur, to whom the present bibliographer owes a debt of gratitude for the preliminary work. 

 The bibliography section of this volume of The Baha'i World includes: published English language books and pamphlets containing translations of works by or passages frpm the Writings of Baha'u'llah, the BTh and 'Abdu'l-Baha works of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice; and a selection of other major works about the Baha'i Faith. These comprise sections 1 — VI and portions of section VII of a more comprehensive bibliography of literature on the Baha'i Faith in English, on which the compiler is currently workin~, and which will shortly be published in full with annotations by the Baha'i Publishing Trust of the United States. A number of sections of the complete bibliography have not been included here, such as Braille materials, periodicals, works containing reference to the Faith~, and articles. 

 Entries in parts 1 — VI are arranged alphabetically by title. Entries in part VII are arranged alphabetically by author's last name where one is known or specifically mentioned in the publication. If no author is known, the item is entered alphabetically under title, ignoring initial articles. Each entry follows standard bibliographic format, using familiar abbreviations: np. 

 means 'no place of publication' and n.d. signifies 'no date'. The Latin idem means identical or the same, referring to repetition of the same bibliographic information as in the immediately previous item. Information enclosed in square brackets [ ] is information which is known or surmised, but which is not actually shown on the publication. Where no paging is shown, the bibliographer has been unable to examine the publication directly. 

 A separate entry is done for: each title; each edition of a specific title; each printing where the publisher or place of publication has changed; or where a printing shows itself to be an entirely new bibliographic item because of significant variation in paging. If a number of unchanged reprintings have been done, and none of the above indications for separate entry apply, the dates of the reprintings are all listed under the single entry. Where a succeeding printing shows only a small variation in paging, the variant is included in the same entry as the previous printing(s) with a note of the paging difference. Notes are also added about other physical variations such as two sizes, or different covers in a single printing. A reference, 'See # ', has been added to some entries, in order to relate items which have the same text, which are selections from another text, or which are differently titled editions of the same work. Book reviews which appeared outside of Baha'i journals, and which mentioned the Baha'i Faith, are listed in a paragraph with the entry of the particular item being reviewed. 

 In order to give some idea of the availability of some of these works in a few other major languages, at the end of entries the following codes will appear when that item has been published in translation: Fr = French; Ge = German; It = Italian; Po = Portuguese; Sp = 

Spanish.

 It is to be hoped that in future issues of The Baha'i World, or in other Baha'i publications, there will appear bibliographies of publications on the Baha'i Faith in other languages, with a view to establishing, in time, coverage of all publications on the Faith.

          2. GUIDE TO TRANSLITERATION AND
                PRONUNCIATION OF THE
                  PERSIAN ALPHABET

  The 'i' added to the name of a town signifies 'belonging to'. Thus Shir~zi means native of Shfr~z. 

           3. NOTES ON THE PRONUNCIATION
                  OF PERSIAN WORDS

  The emphasis in Persian words is more or less evenly distributed, each syllable being equally stressed as in French. 

 For example, do not say Tab riz or Tabarsi; stay as long on one syllable as on the next; Tabriz; Tabarsi. (While there are many exceptions to this rule, it is the most generally correct method of treating the question of stress.) 

 A frequent mistake is the failure to distinguish between broad and flat 'a's.' This differentiation makes the language especially musical and should be observed: in the word Afn~n, for example, pronounce the first 'a' as in account. 

 and the second syllable to rhyme with on. Americans are apt to pronounce short 'a' plus 'r' like the verb form are; this is a mistake; 'ar' should be pronounced as in the word hurry —  cf. Tarbiyat. 

 The same differentiation should be observed in the case of long and short 'i' and long and short 'u'. As the guide to the transliteration indicates, short 'i' is like 'e' in best, and long 'i' like 'ee' in meet; for example, IbrThfm is pronounced 

Eb-r~heem; Ishim is Ess-lahm.

 Short 'u' being like 'o' in short, and long 'ii' like '00' in moon, the following would be pronounced:


<p896>
896                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

Qudd6s —  Qod-dooss; B6rfurfish — 
B6r-foroosh.               

 Pronounce 'aw' to rhyme with low, or mown; Nawruz is No-Rooz. 

 The following consonants may be pronounced  like z: dh z z d The following consonants may be pronounced  like ss: th s s Zh is pronounced like the 's' in pleasure. 

 ~b is pronounced like 'cli' in Scottish loch or German  nacht. Do not pronounce it as 'k'. 

 Westerners  often experience difficulty pronouncing 'gh' and 'q'; a guttural French ½' will serve here; otherwise use hard 'g' as in good. 

 H and 1, approximately like the English aspirate 'h', should never be dropped. Tihr~n is Teh-ron; madrisih is mad-res-seh; 

Mihrib is Meh-rob.         

 In the case of double letters pronounce each separately: 'Abbas. 

 The character transliterated (') represents a pause; it is not unlike the initial sound made in pronouncing such a word as every. 

 The word Baha'i is phonetically as follows: 'a' as in account; '6' as in hail; ('), pause; 'f'as ec in meet. 

 The character transliterated (') may also be treated as a pause. 

 NB. As Persian often indicates no vowel sounds and as its pronunciation differs in different  localities throughout Persia and the Near East as well as among individuals in any given locality, a uniform system of transliteration such as the above, which is in use by Baha'i communities all over the world, is indispensable  to the student.

             1. MEMORIES OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA

                    'ALf M. YAZDf

  'AU M. Yazdi (1899 — 1978), a noted Baha'i lecturer and writer, served on many national committees of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and was, for thirty years, chairman of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Berkeley, California, Marion Carpenter Yazdf, whom he married in 1926, has commemorated his life and service in Youth in the Vanguard: Memoirs and Letters Collected by the 

   First Baha'i Student at Berkeley and at Stanford University (Wilmette: United States

 Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982). The following reminiscence is adapted from a longer work, Prophetic Days: Memories of 'Abdu'l-Baha, written by 'All M, Yazdi in 1975 and compiled by Marion Yazdf. 

  I N 1856, or thereabouts, even as the little city of Yazd, in the very heart of Persia, was carrying on its lackluster existence, something was astir. The town's population for the most part lived in poverty and ignorance, unaware of what was happening in the rest of the world, But there was something stirring. There was hushed talk of the BTh, the new Prophet Who had been martyred, and of the Message He had brought. There were people secretly spreading the news at the risk of their lives. 

 A youth, only fourteen, came into contact with these people, heard the Message and wholeheartedly accepted it. only fourteen years of age! His name was Shaykh 'AU.1 He was the eldest son of the well-to-do and highly respected ItI6ii 

'Abdu'r1Rahim Yazdf.       

 The family was alarmed, The boy was in grave danger. 

 His allegiance could bring ruin to the whole family. But Shaykh 'Alt was ablaze. To distract him from the Bab Faith, his family sent him to Kirman with enough goods to start a business, The shop was successful but soon rumors floated back that he was meeting with the 

Bab's. 'Abdu'r-Rahmfn      

 went to Kirman and brought him home. 

  1 The uncle for whom Ali M, Yazdi was named by 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Later, while still a young man, he was sent by 

Baha'u'llah to Khartoum     

 to help Mirza Haydar-Ali. He stayed on to teach, and died there. 

 In Yazd the boy again attended the secret meetings and took aid to the beleaguered BThis who were imprisoned there, One night he was so late returning home that his mother, terribly worried, waited for him at the door and when he came in, slapped him, without saying a word, In silence he took her hand, kissed it tenderly, and gazed at her with deep love. 

 Throughout this difficult time, in the face of the calumnies and persecutions heaped upon the BThis by their enemies Shaykh 'All displayed  a kindness and fearlessness remarkable in one so young. As time passed, his character, his behavior, his attitude and his actions gradually won over the whole family, One by one they joined the Faith. Now meetings were held in the Yazdi home though the need for secrecy remained paramount. 

 Teachers came from other cities, each with new tales. Some who came from BaghdAd spoke of Baha'u'llah. 

 Later they came from Adrianople, and then from 'Akka. 

 My father, Hdjf Muhammad, who like his brother had joined the Faith when he was fourteen, left for the Holy Land with a friend, a donkey, lots of faith and very Little money. He and his companion set out to see Baha'u'llah and traveled over steep, rugged mountains  and across hot, arid plains until they arrived in 'Akka, around 1870. Other mem 907

908                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  bers of the family followed later. HAji 'Abdu'r-Rahim, my grandfather, left Yazd after he had been tortured, beaten and bastinadoed. The story of this 'precious soul', as the Master called him, his arrival in 'Akka, and his life there, is told with tender compassion by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Memorials of the Faithful.1 Each member of the Yazdi family was given an assignment by Baha'u'llah and sent out to accomplish it. H~ji Muhammad, my father, and two other youthful believers were sent to Egypt where they worked hard for many years and eventually built up a prosperous business. Through these believers — all young people —  the Faith was first established in Alexandria, Cairo and Port Said. Although they were not free to openly teach the Faith they were on good terms with the population and were generally well-liked and respected. 

 My family and I lived in a suburb of Alexandria called Ramleh, a beautiful and peaceful residential district on the edge of the Mediterranean. The house in which I was born, and where I lived until I was about four or five, had a separate guest house and a large garden surrounded by a wall of roughhewn stone. 

 Within the garden there were many lime, sweet lemon, orange and pomegranate trees as well as rose bushes. 

 In the summer a tropical scent hung in the air. 

 The house to which we then moved also had a large garden. Jasmine grew over the veranda, a large open porch adjoining the garden. 

 Here our family often had breakfast, with father presiding at the samovar and dispensing glasses of hot tea to the adults and, to the children, hot water with a drop of tea floating on top. Before breakfast, however, we chanted our morning •prayers and heard father tell wonderful stories about his experiences with Baha'u'llah and the Master, or read the latest communications from the Holy Land. 

 It was in this setting, when I was a child of eleven, that I heard the news of the coming of 'Abdu'l-Baha to Ramleh. The news came suddenly, without warning. The Master had left Haifa without notice on a steamer bound for Europe. Because of ill health and fatigue, He had stopped in Port Said and was coming on to Alexandria. 

 Then the news came that He was coming to Ramich! 

 To Ramleh where 1 Memorials of the Faithful, trans. Marzieh Gail. Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1971, pp. 64 — 66. 
we lived! What a miracle!  

 There was intense joy within the Baha'i community, within my family, within me. Of all the places in the world, He happened to choose Ramleh as His headquarters for His trips to Europe and America during the period 1910 — 1913. Excitement, curiosity, anticipation swirled through my mind. 

 All I knew about 'Abdu'l-Baha was what my father had told us. No one in the immediate family except father and grandfather  had seen Him. 

 The oniy photograph was an early one taken when He was a young man in Adrianople. 

 He was a prisoner beyond our reach, a legendary figure. 

 Now He was free and coming to Ramleb! The Baha'i Faith was an integral part of me, not something superimposed. 

 In Ramleh I was surrounded by it, lived it, believed it, cherished its spiritual concepts and goals and principles. I realized its fundamental importance, its necessity for the world today. Yet my studies at the French school which I attended had opened other areas to my mind. The discoveries  of science fascinated me and I believed they provided us with effective tools for the implementation of the teachings of the Faith. 

 I prayed that I might be guided to play some role in this endeavor. 

 I sensed that my contact with 'Abdu'l-Baha would provide the inspiration and the impetus to move in this direction. So I waited eagerly for the day of His arrival. 

 There was a crowd gathered in front of the Hotel Victoria. 

 Suddenly there was a hush, a stillness, and I knew that He had come. I looked. 

 There He was! He walked through the crowd — slowly, majestically, smiling radiantly  as he greeted the bowed heads on either side. I could only get a vague impression  as I could not get near Him. 

 The sound of the wind and surf from the nearby shore drowned out His voice so I could hardly hear Him. Nevertheless, I went away happy. 

 A few days later, a villa was rented for the Master and His family, not far from the Hotel Victoria, in a lovely residential section that lay right next to the beautiful Mediterranean and the beaches. 

 Like all the villas in that area, it had a garden with blossoms and flowering shrubs. 

 It was there that 'Abdu'l-Baha chose to receive His guests — a great variety of notables, public figures, clerics, aristocrats, writers, as well as poor and despairing people.

  I went there often, sometimes on the way home from school, sometimes on weekends. When I was not in school I spent most of my time in His garden. I would wait to catch a glimpse of Him as He came out for His customary walk, or conversed with pilgrims from faraway places. To hear His vibrant and melodious voice ringing in the open air, to see Him, somehow exhilarated me and gave me hope. Quite often, He came to me and smiled and talked. 

 There was a radiance about Him an almost unlimited kindness and love that shone from Him. Seeing Him, I was infused with a feeling of goodness. I felt humble and, at the same time, exceedingly happy. 

 I had many opportunities to see the Master — as we always called Him — at meetings and on festive occasions. I especially remember the first time He came to our house to address a large gathering of believers. The friends were all gathered, talking happily, waiting. Suddenly all grew quiet. From outside, before He entered the room, I could hear the voice of 'Abdu'l-Baha, very resonant, very beautiful. Then He swept in, with His robe flowing! He was straight as an arrow. His head was thrown back. His silver-gray hair fell in waves to His shoulders. His beard was white; His eyes were keen; His forehead, broad. 

 He wore a white turban around an ivory-colored felt cap. 

 He looked at everyone, smiled and web corned all with Khushdmadid! 

Khushdmadid! (Welcome!     

 Welcome!) I had been taught that in the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, I should sit or stand with my hands crossed in front of me, and look down. I was so anxious to see Him that I found myself looking up furtively now and then. He often spoke — I was privileged to hear Him speak on many subjects. For nine months it seemed like paradise. 

 Then He left us and sailed for Europe. How dismal everything  became. But there was school and there were duties. Exciting news came from Europe, and there were memories! 

 'Abdu'l-Baha came back four months later. Paradise returned. He spoke to me on several occasions, calling me Shaykh 'Au, the name He Himself had given me, after my uncle who was the first member of the family to join the Faith. When 'Abdu'l-Baha spoke to me, I would look into His eyes — blue, smiling and full of love. 

 Again He left us, this time for America. I will never forget the scene of His departure as Pie came out of the house and turned to wave His last farewell to His disconsolate family gazing down from the veranda above. They were greatly concerned about His safety and wellbeing. He was sixty-eight years old. 

 He had suffered many hardships and endured severe trials. 

 He had been in prison for forty years of His life and now He was undertaking this journey to a far-off country utterly different from any to which He was accustomed.  But 'Abdu'l-Baha had made up His mind and nothing could turn Him back. He walked out of the garden gate and never looked back again. He walked for several blocksnear the shore to take the electric train to Alexandria where He would board the ship that was to take Him to New York. He was followed by about thirty believers who walked silently behind Him. I was one of them. 

 What 'Abdu'l-Baha accomplished in America is now history. 

 He went to Europe and came back to Ramleh on 3 July 1913, to remain until the following December. 

 Then He left for Haifa, never to return. 

 That was the first chapter of my experience with 'Abdu'l-Baha when I was a child between the ages of eleven and fourteen. 

 In 1914 my family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, only a short distance north of Haifa. This opened the second chapter when I was privileged to be in the presence of the Master again, but only on special occasions. 

 I was at that time a student at the American University of Beirut, then known as the Syrian Protestant College. In the summer of 1917 I spent my summer vacation with nty uncle, Mirza Husayn Yazdi, in his house on Mt. Carmel, a memorable two months for me. Every evening before sunset I had the bounty of being in the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 I would join the other believers gathered in front of the Master's house. The entrance had an iron gate and then a garden. He would come out with a cheerful and warm greeting, welcome all, and take His seat on the platform at the head of the wide stairs. The sun was going down, and it was very quiet. Sometimes He sat in a relaxed attitude and didn't speak at all. 
Usually, however, He spoke.

 He talked in His commanding voice, looking straight ahead, as if He were addressing  posterity. 

 He talked about Baha'u'llah, about His Teachings, and about significant

  events in the history of the Faith. He told stories sprinkled with humor. 

 Often, however,  He talked of the believers around the world and of their progress in spreading the Faith. Then He would become wistful. For three years, while World War I raged, He had little news from abroad. The isolation and constraint weighed heavily upon Him. Now and then He would address individuals in the audience, ask them about their families, their work, their problems; He would offer advice and help. Toward the end, He would ask one of the believers to chant verses from the poems of Baha'u'llah. 

 When the chanting ended, the meeting was over. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha would arise and enter the house. 

 Dusk would have descended over Haifa. 

 There were frequent visits to the Shrine of the Bab. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha would ride the old horsedrawn, bus-like vehicle up the mountain. The rest of us would walk along the rocky road, past the Pilgrim House, to the terrace overlooking the city of Haifa, the blue bay beyond and, in the distance, the hazy outline of 'Akka. We would gather there until 'Abdu'l-Baha appeared and entered the Shrine. He would chant the Tablet of Visitation. 

Sometimes He asked Shoghi 

 Effendi  to chant this prayer. And when it was all over and the believers began to leave the Shrine, He would stand at the door with a bottle of rose water and put a little in each one's hand. 

 There were also trips — less frequent  — to 'Akka and Baha, and visits to the Shrine of Baha'u'llah. 

 There were also times that summer when 'Abdu'l-Baha went in the horsedrawn carriage to Tiberias, Lake Tiberias and the Sea of Galilee, of Biblical renown. His purpose on these trips was to oversee the grain crops which the believers, under His supervision, had planted in the Jordan Valley. The grain the Master had stored in ancient Roman pits was to be distributed to everyone who needed it, Baha'i and non-Bah6'f alike. On 27 April 1920, in the garden of the Military Governor of Haifa, 'Abdu'l-Baha was invested with the insignia of the Knighthood  of the British Empire in recognition of His humanitarian work during the war for the relief of distress and famine. 

 I would sometimes go into 'Abdu'l-Baha's garden and talk with Ism~ii1 AqA, the gardener, an old man beloved by the Master. On one of my visits to the Master's garden I noticed that everyone was quiet. When I asked why, I was told that a commission of inquiry was interrogating  'Abdu'l-Baha in His room. I could hear 'Abdu'l-Baha's clear, commanding voice through the open window above our heads. He spoke to the members of the commission with dignity and authority as if He were the investigator and they the suspected culprits. Although He was humble in many ways, 'Abdu'l-Baha never really bowed to anyone; at the right time, and in the fight way, He was proud. He would not compromise the Cause of God. Somehow, the confidence with which the Master spoke gave me confidence and faith that He would be spared. Those were dangerous and difficult days. The violators were active and JamM PAsh~ had vowed that he would crucify 'Abdu'l-Baha when he returned  victorious from his campaigns. Whep he did return, however, he was fleeing in defeat and humiliation. Despite the turbulence  of this period the Master conferred upon the Baha'is of the west their world mission by revealing the Tablets of the Divine Plan, eight in 1916 and six in 1917. 

 I remember other little details from the summer of 1917, such as eating at 'Abdu'l-Baha's  table. 

 He ate very simply, but He insisted on others having the proper amount of food. Quite often He would come behind the guests and speak to them. 

 I remember His standing behind my chair saying, 'Why aren't you eating?' 

 I was hungry, but my shyness prevented my eating. 

 'Why aren't you eating, Shaykh 'AliT And He placed a generous portion of rice on my plate. I had to eat it! One day, when I was walking along a curved street up the hill toward the House of 'Abdu'l-Baha, I turned the corner and there He was! I saw the Master walking down the hill, followed by two of the believers. As was the custom, I stepped to one side and bowed. 

 The Master stopped and walked over to me, stopped right in front of me, and looked me straight in the eyes. I shall never forget having seen 'Abdu'l-Baha face to face. 

 What was He like? His bearing was majestic, and yet He was genial. He was full of contrasts: dominant, yet humble; strong, yet tender; loving and affectionate, yet He could be very stern. 

 He was intensely human, most keenly alive to the joys and sorrows of this

  life. There was no one who felt more acutely than He did the sufferings of humanity. 

 At the end of the summer I went to see my family in Damascus before going back to college to graduate. 

 Then I returned home. The war seemed to drag on and on, but finally the end came. Our great concern was Haifa: what had happened there? 

 But soon the news arrived: General Allenby and the British had occupied Haifa and the Master was safe. 

 As the doors to the outside world opened again we began to make plans. 

 There was much thinking and counting of pennies. 

 I had studied civil engineering and had been hired as a draftsman by the government. 

 From my earnings I had saved a little, but it wasn't endugh to enable me to go on with my graduate studies. 

 News of this reached 'Abdu'l-Baha through my uncle, Mirza Husayn, and the Master offered me one hundred pounds which, in those days, was the equivalent of about $500.00. That made it possible for me to go. I wasted no time. 

 In the autumn of 1919 I went to Haifa in order to say farewell to 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 I was on my way to Europe — Switzerland and then Germany — for my graduate studies. I was twenty years old. This was to be my last experience with 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 I was in Haifa for two or three days. Just before I left 'Abdu'l-Baha called me to His room. I was there alone with Him; the only other person was Shoghi Effendi, who was in and out. The Master invited me to be seated and 

He asked Shoghi Effendi   
to bring me some tea.     

 He spoke to me, gave me instructions  on how to live, mentioned that He had hopes for me. He said, 'You are a good boy, Shaykh 'Au.' The tea that Shoghi Effendi brought in a glass was boiling hot. I tried to drink it, but couldn't. 'Abdu'l-Baha said, 'Drink! Drink your tea!' So I had to drink it! It didn't matter! 

 At the very end He gave me His blessing. Then He stood up and beckoned me to Him. I went to 'Abdu'l-Baha and He put His arms around me and kissed me on both cheeks. I never saw Him again. 

 Two years later, when I was at the University of California studying civil engineering, I learned of 'Abdu'l-Baha's ascension. 

 Looking  back, I can see that the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha marked the end of an era. He was passionately devoted to the single goal of spreading the 

Teachings of Baha'u'llah.  

 It was His mission to establish the brotherhood of man on earth in fact, as well as in principle. Nothing stopped Him; nothing deflected Him from His purpose. And yet it was not easy, for despite His high station, He was also intensely human, and He suffered a great deal. He was often very happy, and He always asked the Baha'is to be happy. Be happy! Be happy! That was His counsel to the believers, and He set the example. But there were times when I would see Him with the burdens of the whole world upon His shoulders. 

 There is something I learned from 'Abdu'l-Baha  which I feel should not be forgotten. His life was not really His life alone; it was the life of every one of us. It was an example for every one of us. A new generation of Baha'is is being attracted to the Faith, and a new generation is growing up within the Baha'i community. 

 They will acquire knowledge of the Faith from books. 
But this is a living Faith.

 The Manifestation of God has appeared  and initiated a new era. 

 Baha'is have lived and worked and died for this Cause. The Faith is not something extraneous; it is not merely something beautiful, logical, just and fair — it is the very blood and fiber of our being, our very life. If men and women all over the world were to arise in ever-increasing numbers and make 'Abdu'l-Baha's way of life their own, each pursuing His path with zest and confidence, what would the world be like? Would not these individuals be a new race of men?

912        THE BAHA'I WORLD

     2. LIFE AS METAPHOR1

            JOHN S. HATCHER

  I N contrast to most institutionalized religious thought, the Baha'i Faith teaches that spiritual  reality is logical and that man should examine that reality with the same rational faculties and rigorous standards which he uses in probing the phenomenal world. 

 In support of this approach, the Writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha provide clear, forthright, and logically based responses to virtually every major philosophical and theological question. 

 There is one question, however, that rarely gets asked, not because the answer is unavailable in the Baha'i Writings, but because most people probably do not think to ask it. The question concerns the moral rationale for physical reality — why it exists aqd how it functions in relation to spiritual goals. Sometimes  the matter is dealt with on a superficial level: since God fashioned the physical world and since lie has intended that we should evolve spiritually, then phenomenal reality must be a benevolent creation which somehow  facilitates our development. Such a response may be initially comforting, but it does not penetrate to the heart of the matter where the question is conceived in the first place: it hardly resolves the myriad philosophical and pragmatic dilemmas which confront us daily in our desire to cope intelligently with a world that often seems to make little sense. 

 To some, even the Baha'i writings may appear enigmatic regarding this matter. 

 On the one hand, Baha'u'llah admonishes us to be detached from the physical world: Abandon  not the everlasting beauty for a beauty that must die, and set not your affections on this mortal world of dust.2 On the other hand, He commands us to pay close attention to our Adapted by the author from his 'The Metaphorical Nature of Physical Reality', published in Ba/id'!

 physical actions, to have a vocation, to be wholeheartedly involved in the phenomenal world: The best of men are they that earn a livelihood by their calling and spend upon themselves and upon their kindred for the love of God, the Lord of all worlds.3 

 Since there are no explicit contradictions in the 

Writings of Baha'u'llah    

 regarding this subject and since Baha'u'llah has provided us with the necessary laws and institutions to direct the temporal affairs of men, this question may seem superfluous. 

 Quite possibly  this is why the question is rarely verbalized.  The result of the unasked question remaining unanswered is that many accept a vision of themselves as precariously tottering between two worlds and most approach things physical with confusion or at least some vague but haunting s&nse of guilt or anxiety. 

 Baha'u'llah does give us clear permission to partake of the material bounties of the world: Should a man wish to adorn himself with the ornaments of the earth, to wear its apparels, or partake of the benefits it can bestow, no harm can befall him, if he alloweth nothing whatever to intervene between him and God We still find ourselves trying to live simultaneously in two disparate worlds, one of which, we are told, has the power to impede our spiritual progress. We still sense within us two natures, one spiritual and transcendent, the other appetitive and mundane, and more often than not, the fulfillment of one seems to deny fulfillment of the other. 

  Historically there have emerged three general perceptions of man's proper relationship to physical reality. The first of these attitudes is that man is essentially spiritual in nature and that to attain his highest destiny, man must reject the physical world and the appetites,  passions and other debasing kinds of involvement in that reality. Such a view implies that since man is essentially spiritual, ibid., p. 51.

  he should avoid any activity which detracts from his spiritual concerns. Clearly the purest expression of such a view would be the various forms of asceticism. Antithetical to this view is the notion that man is essentially an animal who is happiest when he devotes himself to the physical world and the bounties it can offer and discards the vain and frustrating attempts to become something more transcendent.  Such a perception may be reflected in a range of philosophical stances, from hedonism to humanism, but however it is expressed, the essentially existential tenor of this attitude reflects an emphasis on the physical man and the present tense. 

 Between these extremes are the various attempts to live successfully while participating in both worlds. In general, such views attempt either to find a middle path wherein physical action is governed by spiritual  guidelines or to discover an integration of the two realities wherein the physical world is perceived as a Platonic analogue to or reflection  of spiritual reality. 

 To one who peruses cursorily the Baha'i Teachings, it might appear that the Baha'i point of view could affiliate with any one of the three categories I have described. The emphasis on practical solutions to world problems, such as world government, world economic systems, and universal education, might seem to imply that the Baha'i Faith is existentially oriented, particularly with regard to the emphasis in the Baha Writings on deeds: The essence of faith is fewness of words and abundance of deeds; he whose words exceed his deeds, know verily his death is better than his life? 

  Other passages from the Writings, taken by themselves, would seem to indicate a complete disregard for the physical world and a suppression of all material concerns: Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My beauty; stop thine ears, that thou mayest hearken unto the sweet melody of My voice; empty thyself of all learning, that thou mayest partake of My knowledge; and sanctify thyself from riches, that thou mayest

 obtain a lasting share from the ocean of My eternal wealth 2 Taken as a whole, the Teachings of the Faith might seem to imply a careful balance, a sort of Aristotelian mean between the extremes of attachment to the physical world and asceticism. 

 A closer examination of the Baha'i Writings, however, reveals a perception of physical and spiritual reality as one integral, harmoniously functioning construct. From this point of view, physical reality is not an arbitrary creation, nor is it something with which we should be only incidentally concerned  as we devote ourselves to another realm. 

What the Baha'i Writings   

 do provide are specific and logical responses to questions about the spiritual significance of the physical world. 

       Throughout the Baha'i      
Writings, Baha'u'llah     

 states that the physical world has the capacity to reflect or manifest spiritual qualities. This capacity is not confined to mankind, however, but is valid as well for all phenomenal  objects ahd relationships among those objects: Know thou that every created thing is a sign of the revelation of God. Each, according to its capacity, is, and will ever remain, a token of the Almighty. 

 Inasmuch as He, the sovereign Lord of all, hath willed to reveal His sovereignty in the kingdom of names and attributes, each and every created thing hath, through the act of the Divine Will, been made a sign of His glory. 

 So pervasive and general is this revelation that nothing whatsoever in the whole universe can be discovered  that doth not reflect His splendor.3 

  Furthermore, He asserts thaj this capaCity is the essential reality of the phenomenal world and that without it, phenomenal reality would cease to exist: Were the Hand of Divine power to divest of this high endowment all created things, the entire universe would become desolate and void.4 

  In another passage, Baha'u'llah states that man can perceive this relationship, i.e. the

  way in which phenomenal obj ects mirror forth spiritual attributes: each and every created thing hath, according to a fixed decree, been endowed with the capacity to exercise a particular influence, and been made to possess a distinct virtue. 

 He is really a believer in the Unity of God who recognizeth in each and every created thing the sign of the revelation of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, and not he who maintaineth that the creature is indistinguishable  from the Creator.1 

 In still other passages, Baha'u'llah explains that the capacity of the physical world to reflect the divine attributes and the capacity of man to recognize this correlation are not coincidental; it is the explicit function of the physical world to educate man: Out of the wastes of nothingness, with the clay of My command I made thee to appear, and have ordained for thy training every atom in existence and the essence of all created things.2 

       Metaphorically, the Writings

 depict physical  reality as a classroom replete with teaching devices, the physical objects themselves. The Baha'i Writings also make clear that the student is not left to his own intuition to utilize this educational environment. He is provided with teachers, the Manifestations, who explain  the objectives of that education and the means by which they can be achieved. In short, the Manifestation relates the physical experience to spiritual growth, though like the wise teacher He is, He forces the student to participate in discerning these correlations. 

 The complexity of the Manifestation's task is partly evident in the fact that He must work on two levels in order to make us understand the nature of where we aspire to be, a spiritual realm, and of where we are, the physical world. 

Consequently, the Manifestation 

 has two corresponding aspects of His identity. 

 As He reiterates the eternal, changeless  attributes of the spiritual world, He is a Revelator, an Unveiler of divine reality and moral law. In this context, religious law transcends the usual connotation of the imposition  of order on disorder. Properly understood,  moral or spiritual law assumes the same 1 ibid p. 189. 

Baha'u'llah, The Hidden     
Words, p. 32.              

 objective authority as scientific law: just as scientific law describes relationships among phenomenal entities, so spiritual and moral law describe the relationships among spiritual entities. In this sense, moral law is not an arbitrary prescription; it is objective description. 

 So it is that we ascribe to Newton the virtue of having discovered and formulated the law of mutual attraction of masses, not of having contrived or invented this property of matter. 

Similarly, the Manifestation

 does not create divine reality or the laws governing that reality: He reveals them to us and promulgates compliance with them. 

 Likewise, just as advances in scientific understanding render more and more complete our descriptions  of the phenomenal world, so the progression  of revelation by the Manifestations renders our understanding of the spiritual reality and its laws more and more accurate and complete. 

         But the Manifestation      

 is not only a describer or revealer. He actively affects the degree to which the physical world reflects the spiritual world. In this capacity, He becomes more than an instructor who helps us to understand and utilize our physical classroom; He becomes a creative force which puts in motion the energies and laws that will cause that spiritual reality to be actuated in the phenomenal  world. 

 For example, when Baha'u'llah instituted the concept of the equality of men and women, He was both revealing a spiritual verity which has always existed, and pronouncing  to what extent the physical world is ready to manifest that reality. Likewise, when Baha'u'llah speaks of the unity of science and religion, He is revealing an objective reality, a universal law, that these two bodies of learning are probing the same organic construct and therefore are not in conflict. At the same time, Baha'u'llah is admonishing the human institutions which embody these areas of human investigation to become aware of this verity and to implement it in their own actions so that man may live more successfully. 

 From the Baha'i perspective, then, there is no conifict between the physical world and the spiritual world, nor should there be a problem with man's participation in either. 

 That is, in theory if one follows the guidelines which the


<p915>
ESSAYS AND REVIEWS           915

  Manifestation provides, the study of and participation in one world will enhance and facilitate one's perception of and capable utilization of the other. Furthermore, the Baha'i point of view renders invalid the traditional distinction between the methods used to probe these two facets of our experience.  Instead of perceiving religious belief as being beyond and impervious to rational investigation, the Baha'i Writings 'state that the same standards which are valid for examining scientific belief are equally appropriate  to religious conviction: God has endowed man with intelligence and reason whereby he is required to determine the verity of questions and propositions. 

 If religious beliefs and opinions are found contrary to the standards of science they are mere superstitions and imaginations; for the antithesis of knowledge is ignorance, and the child of ignorance is superstition. Unquestionably there must be agreement between  true religion and science. If a question be found contrary to reason, faith and belief in it are impossible and there is no outcome but wavering and vacillation.1 

  Baha'u'llah's statements about the educational value of phenomenal reality portray the essential unity of the physical and spiritual realms, but in order to understand how spiritual education takes place on the individual level, we must first understand the metaphorical relationship between the two aspects of reality. 

 First of all, metaphor is one of several kinds of analogical devices, all of which function more or less the same — they compare, two essentially dissimilar things. The objects compared  may be people, situations, relationships, abstractions, or any sort of material thing, but always there is an implicit or explicit statement  of similarity between these essentially different subjects. Secondly, whether the analogical  device is metaphor, simile, allegory, conceit, symbol, or some other type of figure, it will contain three basic parts: the tenor, that which is being described; the vehicle, that which is compared to the tenor; and the 1 'Abdu'l-Baha in Baha'i World Faith, p. 240. 

 meaning, that area of similarity between the tenor and vehicle. 

 The term metaphor is often used to designate  this process in general, though strictly speaking, the metaphor is a relatively short, implicit analogical device. Sometimes the term figure or the term image is also used in this general sense, figure denoting figure of speech or rhetorical device, and image designating figurative image. But whatever term one uses, and regardless of whether the device is a one-word metaphor or an elaborate parable, a particularly interesting process must occur if the device is to work effectively. 

 The reader or listener must be made to think, to be a bit creative, because he must complete the final and most important part of the process himself. 

 He is responsible for determining in what way the tenor and vehicle are similar. 

 Take the simple metaphor 'Jane is a lovely flower'. 

 The analogical equation is established because the tenor 'Jane' is essentially different from the vehicle 'flower'. (Had we compared Jane to Mary, the tenor and the vehicle would be essentially the same, both being women, and no analogy would occur.) The reader or listener must now finish the process by deciding what the tenor and vehicle have in common. If the metaphor is completely obvious  or trite, then the mind may go from the tenor to the meaning without the least examination of the vehiclg. So everyday similes such as 'cold as ice' or 'hard as a rock' require no mental examination of the vehicle because no resistance is offered and the process is short circuited. Description has occurred, but the device has not caused the reader to participate significantly. 

 The value or function of the analogical process is immense. On the obvious level, it is a useful way to explain the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar, the abstract in terms of the concrete. In addition, it has the capacity to compress a great deal of meaning into a few words, and because it offers a variety of meanings, it can be an expansive description rather than a limiting or restrictive one. But probably the most important feature of the analogical process is its ability to educate. That is, when one is forced to examine the vehicle in order to understand the tenor, he is exercising one of his most important capacities as a human being:


<p916>
916                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Metaphor is a process of comparing and identifying one thing with another. 

 Then as we see what things have in common, we see the general meaning they have. Now the ability to see the relationship between one thing and another is almost a definition of intelligence. Thinking in metaphors is a tool of intelligence. Perhaps it is the most important tool.' 

 In addition to exercising this faculty of discernment, one is also extracting the meaning for himself instead of having meaning imposed on him. Thus, the analogical process is indirect and objective in that the teacher is one step removed from the teaching device. 

 In effect, if one is to obtain meaning, he must exercise his volition and examine the two ingredients. When he gets the meaning on his own, he will not feel that he has been told what to think, though he may be grateful to the one who was creative enough to conceive the equation. 

 One can hardly discuss the use of the analogical process with regard to religion without mentioning at least one more important asset of this device: it is a safeguard against dogmatism. For example, when Christ states that He is the 'Bread of Life',2 He means something positive by it; that He is valuable, a source of sustenance, of spiritual nutrition, and a variety of other things. But there is no one 'correct' translation of the equation. To view the metaphor as having one meaning is to miss the analogical equation, mistake the vehicle for the tenor, and to end up believing that Christ was actually a piece of bread. 

 But perhaps 'he clearest sign of the importance of this process in human development  is that without this ability we would not be able to ascend for even a moment from the physical world, because abstract thought is impossible without the use of metaphor. Therefore in order to discuss or understand or perceive spiritual qualities, we must first relate them to a concrete form: •  human knowledge is of two kinds. One is the knowledge of things perceptible to the senses The other kind of human knowledge is intellectual — that is to say, it is

 'Abdu'l-Baha goes on to give examples of this mechanism of human intellect as it enables us to communicate the knowledge of abstract thought: For example, grief and happiness are intellectual things; when you wish to express those spiritual qualities you say: 'My heart is oppressed; my heart is enlarged'; though the heart of man is neither oppressed nor enlarged. 

 This is an intellectual or spiritual state, to explain which you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures. 

 Another example: you say, 'such an individual made great progress,' though he is remaining in the same place; or again, 'such an one's position was exalted,' although like every one else, he walks upon the earth. This exaltation and this progress are spiritual states and intellectual  realities; but to explain them you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures, because in the exterior world there is nothing that is not sensible. So the symbol of knowledge is light, and of ignorance, darkness;  but reflect, is knowledge sensible light, or ignorance sensible darkness? No, they are merely symbols.4 

 Hand in hand with the faculty for inductive logic, the analogical sensibility enables the child to pass beyond the Pavlovian or Skin-nerian  reflex and to conceptualize himself and the world around him. Wittingly and unwittingly,  a child collects the data from his daily experience, perceives the similarity among these experiences, and induces an abstract belief about those experiences. 

 For example, the child is punished or corrected for various actions, essentially different actions, and he perceives the similar ingredients of rules, authority, obedience. He then induces the generalizations about those concepts — that there are rules which require his obedience to authority, or, if there is no consistency to the

  rules of their application, that authority is capricious, unjust, frightening. 

 From such initial stages of abstract thought, the child can progress without limit to larger, more expansive and encompassing abstractions,  since the concept will always be in a relative state of being perceived. For example,  once having perceived authority as it is dramatized in the familial relationship, the child may inductively collect and store other dramatizations of this abstraction, perhaps in a teacher, or in a public official. 

 As he continues to expand the data he collects, he may perceive authority elsewhere; a belief in truth, honesty, or kindness, for example, may represent authority to some people more powerfully than any human figure of authority. 

 The point is that there is no final or complete perception of the abstraction; it can always be more acutely perceived or more exquisitely dramatized in the phenomenal world. 

 Of course, the idea of limitless growth is not confined to the individual. 

 Society itself  can manifest a collective awareness of authority, justice, honesty, and as its awareness of these attributes expands, society is capable of implementing that understanding more completely in social action. 

 Viewed in this context, the metaphorical process is an educational tool which can help provide unlimited development, even if one has no precise moral code or established theological belief. However, within the context  of the Baha'i perception of man's nature and destiny, this process assumes a much greater significance — not only does this endeavor  bring immediate fulfillment and happiness  by utilizing the physical metaphor as it was created to be used; it also results in the gradual improvement of the soul itself as, incrementally, particular attributes are habituated and assimilated. 
                           
           III                        

  The improvement of the soul by dramatizing spiritual attributes is hardly a new notion. The allegorical fable has long been recognized as an effective device for teaching children. 

 Likewise in the medieval era, the Christian church used allegorical theater (morality plays) to teach an unlearned and predominately illiterate populace the essential doctrine of their Faith. 

 In fact, virtually all drama, including classical tragedy, ultimately  derives from this same impetus and origin. Common among all these forms was the attempt to give tropological expression to metaphysical concepts — to express spirituality in concrete form. 

 This is not to imply that all such devices can be distilled into one common process, but all do share essentially the same ingredients or steps. 

 First, one must understand the nature of the attribute by observing how this quality might be made manifest in physical action. Secondly, one must decide to acquire this attribute by determining to carry out this action. 

 Third, one must fulfill his noble intentions, not once, but consistently, repeatedly  until the response is habitual, instinctive. When a particular dramatization of the attribute  has been habituated, we can assume that the soul has, to some degree, assimilated that quality. 

 It is then possible for one to perceive that same attribute on a higher level and to implement this understanding with a repetition of the same sequence of responses. In this manner, the human soul can continue to progress, whether in this world or the next, without ever reaching a final stage of perfection because, according to the Baha'i Writings, the human soul has the capacity for infinite growth: When man reaches the noblest state in the world of humanity, then he can make further progress in the conditions of perfection, but not in state; for such states are limited, but the divine perfections are endless. 

 Both before and after putting off this material form, there is progress in perfec-don,  but not in state. So beings are consummated  in perfect man. There is no other being higher than a perfect man. But when he has reached this state he can still make progress in perfections but not in state, because there is no state higher than that of a perfect man to which he can transfer himself 1 The physical metaphor, then, functions on this plane as an integral and inextricable part of man's efforts to fulfill his primary goal, spiritual development. It provides the means by which he perceives spiritual qualities in the

  first place, and it is the means by which he may express and acquire that attribute once it is understood. 

 Even as the process of spiritual growth attains higher levels of response, man never completely relinquishes on this plane this reciprocal relationship between the conception  of spirituality and the implementation through metaphorical act. 
    Take the example of cleanliness.

 A child may first understand this abstraction in terms of seeing the similarity among diverse acts of cleanliness he is required to perform —  cleaning his room, washing his body, putting his toys in order. 

 In the beginning, these acts are received as separate commands: each requires understanding, volition, and action, until it becomes habituated. At some point, the child may perceive the analogical relationship that unites these acts, and instead of having to learn so many specific regulations, he will be able to reverse the process — to apply  his understanding of the quality of cleanliness to other ostensibly unrelated situations and to habituate more and more specific manifestations  of this quality. As each level of understanding is implemented through habit and discipline, the child is liberated and enabled to apply his volitional energies to ever more sophisticated levels of understanding —  cleanliness of thought, purity of motive, chastity of conduct. 

 Even such a brief treatment of how this process works makes apparent several important  factors related to spiritual growth through physical action. First, it is almost inevitably true that spiritual growth is gradual, painstaking, difficult. There are, no doubt, moments of great insight, visions of great change, and possibly days and weeks of rapid advancement. 

 But the enduring and effective change of the human soul is attained slowly, meticulously, wittingly. Secondly, it becomes clear that habit and discipline instead of being restrictive or limiting, are, when applied positively to the formation of attributes, agents of liberation and advancement. 

 Without  some capacity for self-discipline, one cannot become released from one level of response in order to ascend to the next level. Consequently, the early training of a child in the formation of good habits and the use of discipline is, when properly taught, a key to freedom and not a stuffing of the creative spirit. Once accustomed to the rewards of applied habit and discipline, one will be less likely to be overwhelmed by a third factor in this process, the negative feedback that is incurred when one struggles against the natural inertia and resistance to growth. 

 That is, if we are looking for spiritual growth without discomfort, we will fare about as well as a marathon runner trying to become conditioned  without the willingness to endure days of strain and breathlessness. 

 If we are not accustomed to persisting in spite of anxiety and discomfort, if we have not experienced analogous efforts where we have persisted and have been rewarded by positive results, then the abstract understanding of the value of our efforts may not be enough impetus to ensure success. This verity explains the problem with seeking a religion which feels good, the assumption being that the seeker is where he should be, already perfected, and any belief which feels uncomfortable by implying he should struggle to change is clearly erroneous. 

  If the metaphorical process is the best device by which spiritual growth is initiated in the physical world, then it would seem logical that this process would be evident in the methods of the Manifestations, since they are perfect teachers sent to direct our spiritual development.  And what we find when we examine the teaching techniques of the Manifestations is that the metaphorical devices constitute the core of Their methodology as reflected in Their actions, language, and laws. 

 First of all, the actions, even the identity of the Manifestation involve the metaphorical process. 

 Besides being an Emissary, the Manifestation  is also an Exemplar, a perfect reflection  of the attributes of God. This capacity relates directly to man's twofold purpose in life: The purpose of God in creating man hat/i been, and will ever be, to enable him to know his Creator and to attain His Presence.' 

Since the Baha Writings  

 depict God as essentially Unknowable, then the most effective means of knowing God is through the Manifestation who portrays that Essence to us. Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 70.

  It is clear, however, that attaining the Presence of God does not imply physical proximity,' but changing the spiritual condition  of our souls so that we are ever more completely acquiring the spiritual attributes of God thereby becoming more like Him. 

 As we have already seen, however, acquisition cannot  take place without understanding. What a study of the Writings quickly reveals, in other words, is that knowing God and attaining His Presence are aspects of one' process. 

 As Baha'u'llah points out in His initial statement in the Aqdas, one cannot sever the recognition of the Manifestation from obedience to His laws: These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable without the other.2 

 Recognition of the Manifestation, then, is a necessary prerequisite for spiritual advancement; it is not sufficient to follow some pattern of behavior. And recognition of the Manifestation implies more than perceiving the validity of His description of the universe  and the pragmatic value of His ordinances;  it involves perceiving the way in which the Manifestation metaphorizes or dramatizes God to us. In this way, the Manifestation is clearly distinct from every other spiritual teacher, no matter how astute their teachings or wise their laws. To know God is to know the Manifestation first, and to know the Manifestation is to understand the way in which He manifests the qualities of God. 

 In responding to Philip's request to see the Father, Christ states: 'Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? 

 He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, "Show us the Father"?'3 Of course, it is important not to confuse the tenor with the vehicle, not to take the metaphor at its literal value, but to extract the meaning by discerning the similarity between the two components, between the vehicle (Christ) and the tenor (God). 

 Clearly the similarity between these essentially different entities  is not physical, since the Manifestation is not necessarily physically impressive and since God is not a physical being. The similarity is ibid., p. 184.

 not in physical power, since none of the Manifestations aspires to earthly ascendancy. Clearly the commonly held qualities are spiritual  powers and capacities. To confuse the literal or physical nature of the vehicle, the person or personality of the Manifestation, with the tenor it represents, the nature of God, is to do more than misuse an analogy. To miss the metaphorical nature of the relationship between the Manifestation and God is to utterly misunderstand the nature of the Manifestation, to fail to understand God Himself, and to confuse the whole educative process by which the Manifestation is attempting  to instruct us. It is no doubt because of this confusion that the Manifestations expend such energy in trying to make this analogical relationship quite clear. 

 For example, even though Christ states that no one can understand God except by first understanding Christ, He makes it clear that He is essentially different from God: 'I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.'4 Furthermore, throughout His teaching, He explains that He is not the authority behind the Revelation, but a reflection  of the Deity Who is: 'He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.'5 'For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak. '6 'The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.'7 

Similarly, Baha'u'llah     

 clearly explains the relationshfp of the Manifestation to God, and repeatedly enunciates this same theme — that He is a tool which God uses to educate men: This thing is not from Me, but frqm One Who is 

Almighty and All-Knowing.

Me.1                      

 One example of the disastrous results of not recognizing the metaphorical process at work in the nature of the Manifestation is evident in the far-reaching effects of the vote taken at the Council of Nicea in 325. The followers of Athanasius had come to believe that the tenor and the vehicle were one — that Christ and God were the same essence. The followers of Anus believed that Christ was essentially inferior to God. Anus lost. The institution of the Church sanctioned the theology of Athanasius, condemned as heresy the views of Anus, and effectively severed itself from Christ's fundamental teaching for all time. 

 As Muhammad pointed out to the Christians, to equate Christ with God was to add Gods to God, in effect, to believe in more than one God, as the idolators did in Muhammad's day: 'Infidels now are they who say, "God is the Messiah, Son of Mary;" for the Messiah said, "0 children of Israel! worship God, my Lord and your Lord." 

 Whoso shall join other gods with God, God shall forbid him the Garden, and his abode shall be the Fire; and the wicked shall have no helpers.'2 The use of metaphor is also the key to unlocking the meaning of the physical acts of the Manifestations. 

 Since none of the Manifestations aspire to physical authority or dominion, then clearly any expression of physical power has little importance as a literal phenomenon. 

 In healing the sick, Christ was not attempting to rid the nation of disease or demonstrate innovative medical technique. As 'Abdu'l-Baha explains, the miraculous acts of the Manifestations had as their primary and essential value the metaphorical or analogical dramatization of a spiritual action: The outward miracles have no importance for the people of Reality. If a blind man receive sight, for example, he will finally again become sightless, for he will die, and be deprived of all his senses and powers. Therefore causing the blind man to see is comparatively of little importance, for this ibid p. 102.

 faculty of sight will at last disappear. If the body of a dead person be resuscitated, of what use is it since the body will die again? But it is important to give perception and eternal life, that is the spiritual and divine life Whenever in the Holy Books they speak of raising the dead, the meaning is that the dead were blessed by eternal life; where it is said that the blind receive sight, the signification is that he obtained the true perception This is ascertained from the text of the Gospel where Christ said: 'These are like those of whom Isaiah said, They have eyes and see not, they have ears and hear not; and I healed them.' 

 The meaning is not that the Manifestations are unable to perform miracles, for they have all power. 

 But for them the inner sight, spiritual healing, and eternal life are the valuable and important It is with obvious wisdom, therefore, that Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha exhort the Ba-h&is  not to place any emphasis on the miracles associated with Baha'u'llah. 

 First of all, as 'Abdu'l-Baha points out, the act is valuable only to those who witness the event, and even those may doubt what they have seen: I do not wish to mention the miracles of Baha'u'llah, for it may be said that these are traditions, liable both to truth and to error Though if I wished to mention the supernatural acts of Baha'u'llah, they are numerous; they are acknowledged in the Orient, and even by some strangers to the Cause Yes miracles are proofs for the bystander only, and even he may regard them not as a miracle but as an enchantment.4 

 In the second place, there is an obvious temptation on the part of the followers of a Manifestation to praise Him for these physical acts and perceive Him as a figure of temporal power instead of spiritual authority. In other words, it is too easy for the followers to become attached to the metaphorical vehicle, the 

Manifestation Himself     

 or the literal act He performs, instead of perceiving the essential value of these metaphors, the similarity

  between these Vehicles and what They metaphorize. 

 The incident of Christ's feeding the five thousand is a particularly instructive example of this problem. 

 After He performed the miracle of feeding the masses with only five barley loaves and two fishes, the people believed He was a Prophet. When Christ perceived that they wanted to take Him by force and make Him king, He fled to the hills by Himself. 

 His reason for this evasive action He explained to His disciples the next day when they found Him on the other side of the sea of Galilee: 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.'1 When the people missed the essential meaning or inner significance of His act, and wanted to follow Him for the literal value of the physical action, He left them. 

 The patience with which He afterwards tried to explain the analogical value of His actions is evident in the continuation of His explanation: 'Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness;  as it is written, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat." Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 

 For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world." They said to him, "Lord, give us this bread always." Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst." 

 '2 If we think that Christ belabors this imagery, we are wrong; even when He repeats and extends this conceit, the Jews are not able to perceive the analogical process He is using: 'I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.' 

 'The Jews then disputed among themselves, 1 John, 6:25. 

2 John 6:31 — 35.            

 saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"'3 Having been raised in a legalistic religious tradition, the Jews had difficulty understanding teachings which were communicated through analogy, even though most of their own ritual was, in its original intention, metaphorical dramatization. 

 In a very real sense, the actions and teaching methods of Christ were aimed at breaking through this literalistic tradition in order to teach His followers to think analogically, to sense the spirit behind the works. As one of His last actions among His disciples, for example, He continued the bread imagery at the Last Supper: 'Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my body." And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." ~ In this case, a verbal metaphor was not sufficient; Christ has His own disciples act out the analogy. 

 The life of Baha'u'llah also contains many actions with obvious analogical meaning. The conference at Badasht is perhaps one of the most intriguing. 

 The occasion was the need to 'implement the revelation of the Bay6n by a sudden, a complete and dramatic break with the past — with its order, its ecciesiasticism, its traditions, and ceremonials.'5 In order to act out this transition, Baha'u'llah rented three gardens, one for Himself, one for Quddhs, a third for TAhirih. According to a prearranged plan,6 Quddiis and iThirib publicly quarreled  during the conference, Qudd6s advocating a conservative view that the followers of the BTh not disassociate themselves from the religion of Ishm and T6hirih urging a complete break with Islhm: 

'ft was Baha'u'llah Who     

 steadily, unerringly, yet unsuspectedly, steered the course of that memorable episode, and it was Baha'u'llah Who brought the meeting to its final and

 dramatic climax. One day in His presence, when illness had confined Him to bed, T6hirih, regarded as the fair and spotless emblem of chastity and the incarnation of the FAtimih, appeared suddenly, adorned yet unveiled, before the assembled companions, seated herself on the right-hand of the affrighted and infuriated Quddds, and, tearing through her fiery words the veils guarding the sanctity of the ordinances of IslAm, sounded the clarion-call, and proclaimed the inauguration of a new Dis'1 pensation. 

 This dramatic event no doubt had many figurative meanings, not the least of which was a transition from one 'garden', Ishm, to a completely new 'garden', the Bab Revelation. We may also find symbolism in the fact that Baha'u'llah occupied a third 'garden', possibly 

His Revelation:            

 Proclaim unto the children of assurance that within the realms of holiness, nigh unto the celestial paradise, a new garden hat/i appeared,  round which circle the denizens of the realm on high and the immortal dwellers of the exalted paradise.2 

 Possibly the most obvious use of metaphor by the Manifestations is in the language They use. 

 Whether it is the allegorical myths of the Old Testament, the parables of Christ, or the exquisite poetic imagery of Baha'u'llah's verses,  the language of the Manifestations frequently  relies on figures drawn from the phenomenal world in order to translate abstract  concepts into terms that men can understand. 

 To render a comparative analysis of the types of imagery used by the successive Manifestations would require volumes, but several general. observations will help to demonstrate how essential metaphor is in the language of these Teachers. 

 As Baha'u'llah explains in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn, the Manifestations do not always use language which is veiled, illusive, analogical; the way They speak depends on the exigencies of the situation: It is evident unto thee that the Birds of Heaven and Doves of Eternity speak a twofold language. 

 One language, the outward language, is devoid of allusions, is unconcealed and unveiled; that it may be a

Words, p. 27.              

 guiding lamp and a beaconing light whereby wayfarers may attain the heights of holiness, and seekers may advance into the realm of eternal reunion. 

 Such are the unveiled traditions  and the evident verses already mentioned. 

 The other language is veiled and concealed, so that whatever lieth hidden in the heart of the malevolent may be made manifest and their innermost being be disclosed In such utterances, the literal meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what hat/i been intended.3 

 An illustration of Baha'u'llah's statement might be the distinction we would make between the language with which the Manifestation reveals His laws and the language with which He inspires and explains spiritual attributes. 

 Of course, there are no exact rules regarding when a Manifestation will speak metaphorically and when He will not. 

 As we look at the Old Testament, for example, we can only guess how literally the followers of Abraham or Moses perceived the anthropomorphic  descriptions of God and the physical evidences of His intervention in the Lives of men. But two major uses of metaphorical language seem relatively consistent, at least with Christ and 

Baha'u'llah.                

 The first recurring use is to convey concepts of spirituality, for which purpose Christ used the parable. Like the other analogical devices, the parable forces the listener to participate, to decide the meaning. But being an extended analogy in the form of a story, the parable has the further advantage of working on various levels with multiple analogical equations, and of holding th~ listener's interest, since it is also a dramatic story. 

 Thus while Christ was establishing an intimacy with the literal story by using characters and situations familiar to His audience (laborers in vineyards, sowers of seed, etc.), He was also teaching His followers to think abstractly, to escape the literalism of their past beliefs and to understand the spiritual or inner significance of His words. Instead of an elaborate canon of law, He left them with a treasury of memorable stories, though He left Laws as well. Each of these stories could operate on a level of applicability

  appropriate to anyone searching for understanding and enlightenment. Those who could not penetrate the literal story could not understand His teachings; those who had not already penetrated the literalism of their own Messianic prophesies probably did not recognize the authority of Christ in the first place: 'Then the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?" And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 

 This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, nor do they understand." 

 '~ Christ later told His disciples that 'the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures but tell you plainly of the Father,'2 and certainly Baha'u'llah fulfills this promise in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn. Without veiled language or indirection Baha'u'llah reveals a highly structured exposition on God's divine plan, describes the nature of the Manifestations and clarifies the logical basis for the teaching methods of the Manifestations. 

 Baha'u'llah does use imagery when it is called for and He uses it with unsurpassable skill and magnificence. In His meditative Writings, in most of the prayers, in mystical treatises such as The Seven Valleys and The Four Valleys which rely heavily on metaphor and allegory, in the second half of the Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah and in various other poetic and allusive tablets, Baha'u'llah has bequeathed to us a storehouse of metaphor and symbol which mankind will study for some time to come before scratching the surface of possible meanings. In fact, in describing those utterances in which the literal  meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what hath been intended,3 Baha'u'llah states: Thus it is recorded: 'Every knowledge hath seventy meanings, of which one only is known amongst the people. And when the 

Matthew 13:10 — 13.          
2 John 16:25.              

  Baha'u'llah, The Kitdb-i-Iqdn, p. 255. 

 Qd'im shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all that which remaineth.' 

 He also saith: 'We speak one word, and by it we intend one and seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we can explain.'4 But it is not only in the more abstruse tablets that Baha'u'llah uses imagery. Even in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn, which is a relpiively straightforward  essay, or in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, which contains the Laws of Baha'u'llah, there appears image upon image, sometimes only a word or a phrase, but often several lines in length. 

 'To give even the most cursory treatment of these images would be difficult in so short a space; to survey them would be impossible. 

 One need only glimpse a few of the numerous images that appear in the opening passages of the Kitab-i-Aqdas to understand the problem: Know assuredly that My commandments are the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My mercy for My creatures. 

 Think not that we have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power. 

 Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of Mine utterance, they must be faithfully obeyed by all, though My decree be such as to cause the heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder.5 

 In these excerpts from some of Baha'u'llah's prefatory remarks about His laws, we see the laws compared to lamps, keys, choice wine, and the sun, and these are but a meager sampling of the quantity, the quality and complexity of imagery in the language of Baha'u'llah's less metaphorical 

Writing.                   

 But besides using metaphor in the language of Their teachings, the Manifestations utilize metaphor in the language of prophecy. 

 Many Christians are still trying to discover the figurative meaning of the metaphorical terms with which Christ describes His return, or the key to the symbols used in Revelations. Likewise, the scholars of Lshm have devoted  themselves to interpreting the veiled traditions regarding the Promised Q&im, just as the Jews have looked for the fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy.

  Perhaps because prophecy is such an important link from one Revelation to the next, Baha'u'llah devotes a good portion of the Kitdb-i-Iqdn to a study of the nature of prophecy. In fact, because it is replete with examples of how recurring metaphors are used and because it discusses the rationale behind the use of prophecy, the Kitdb-i-Iqdn could almost be considered a textbook study on the subject. 

Specifically, Baha'u'llah  

 discusses  the use of metaphorical language as He explains vehicles such as 'suns', 'heaven', 'clouds', 'smoke', and 'angels'; but more interestingly, He discusses some of the reasons for this intentional obfuscation. 

 Clearly the failure to describe the exact time and place and personality of the next Manifestation is not due to a lack of knowledge  on the part of God or His Messengers, but if people were to follow a name or physical aspect only, they would not actually understand what it was they sought. Some might turn to the Manifestation because they wished to achieve fame or use His power for their benefit. 

 Those who already possessed authority and power might view a Manifestation  as a threat to their esteem. 

 But because the Manifestation is hidden, one must be spiritually aware in order to discover Him. If one understands authority and power in literal terms, if he looks for a physically impressive figure or someone who aspires to temporal  power, he will not be able to discover the meaning of the figurative language of prophecy. 

 In order to be changed by the spiritual power which emanates from the Manifestation,  one has to be spiritually receptive, in the same way that a television receiver can take the invisible signals which surround us and translate them into intelligible pictures. If one examines prophetic language, or confronts  the Manifestation, and does not have spiritual receptivity, he may perceive some power, but he will not be able to translate its meaning. In this sense, prophetic language is essentially metaphorical so that we will be obliged to educate ourselves spiritually in order to benefit from 

God's Messengers.          

 In the laws of the Manifestation one can find another use of metaphor, though generally not in the language of the laws. For the most part, the Manifestations describe their laws and the actions of men through these laws in clear, straightforward language, but the actions they require do have metaphorical value, or inner significance. That is, besides the pragmatic benefits which the laws may bestow, they also force us to act out dramatically in the physical world what we are trying to accomplish in the spiritual world. 

 This correlation may not be so apparent with the laws which are basically restrictive and prohibitive in nature, but it is there all the same. For example, the Jews may have thought the Mosaic dietary laws to be arbitrary, but they followed them anyway, and in doing so they practiced reverence for the authority of Moses and His beneficent intentions. 

 Now that science has described how various diseases are contracted, we can understand  the scientific basis for the Mosaic laws and perceive that these socalled restrictions were actually a source of liberation. 

 In this sense, perceiving this divine logic and learning to follow the prescribed conduct which the Manifestations reveal is training ourselves to have faith in the ultimate liberation which this ostensible restriction imposes. 

 It is then possible  to apply this lesson to our compliance with spiritual laws; no longer are these exhortations  viewed as incidental. Like their counterparts (the physical laws) they are pragmatic, logical, sources of liberation. 

 The training we experience in complying with laws governing our physical action transfers into the realm of spiritual action, and the end result is that we understand dramatically and metaphorically the beneficence of God's laws: Say:   True liberty consisteth in man's submission  unto My commandments, little as ye know it Were men to observe that which We have sent down unto them from the Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty, attain unto perfect liberty. 

 Happy is the man that hat/i apprehended the Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from the Heaven of His Will, that pervadeth all created things.1 

 Understood in the light of this statement by Baha'u'llah, the laws of the Manifestation never prevent the full and complete utilization of the physical experience. 

 On the contrary, even those laws which imply restriction ulti-1  ibid., p. 25.

  mately encourage the most fulfilling use of the physical metaphor. Stated another way, the laws of the Manifestation enable one to experience the metaphorical value of the physical world, even when the follower is unaware that he is doing anything other than obeying divine authority. 

 The laws which provide creative use of physical experience are perhaps even more obviously reenforcing the metaphorical value of the physical experience than are the laws of admonition and prohibition. In the first place, these laws change constantly from one Manifestation  to the next so that they accurately describe the relative progress of man. As I have already attempted to show, this progress itself is essentially metaphorical in nature in that it is a literal societal construct which figuratively portrays a spiritual condition. When the law creates institutions, organizational  structure, and codes of behavior which foster metaphorical advancement, it is an integral part of man's efforts to dramatize or act out spiritual progress. But besides this long-range benefit, the law has the immediate effect of creating for the individual at that moment in time an atmosphere or environment conducive to spiritual growth. The profound influence that physical environment can have on mental and spiritual outlook we are only beginning to understand, but the Manifestation has always understood this reality and has reflected as much in His laws. Thus, whether the law describes how people organize, carry out human relationships, care for their bodies, worship, or perform any other literal act, it is helping to effect spiritual development: External cleanliness, although it is but a physical thing, hath a great influence upon spirituality. For example, although sound is but the vibrations of the air which affect the tympanum of the ear, and vibrations of the air are but an accident among the accidents which depend upon the air, consider how much marvelous notes or a charming song influence the spirits!1 

 As the law gradually enhances man's ability to manifest spiritual concepts through dramatic,  analogical physical action, it participates in the largest and most important metaphorical exercise on the planet, the establishment of a spiritual kingdom expressed in terms of a societal structure. 

 Seen in this light, the entire Baha'i administrative order, its institutions and procedures are dramatic physical expressions of this spiritual process. 

 Finally, many of the laws themselves are directly metaphorical exercises. 

 When Christ wished to teach the abstract concept of Love to His followers, He ordained a law that dramatizes this quality: 'You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if anyone would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well; and if any one forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to him who begs from you, and do not refuse him who would borrow from you For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even tax collectors do the same?'2 

Likewise, while Baha'u'llah 

 teaches us the abstract concepts of the spiritual equality of men and the unity of mankind, He also provides us through His creative laws the dramatic institutions which enable us to act out that spiritual reality with physical action. Properly understood and perceived, many of the laws of the Manifestations are similarly dramaturgical in nature, metaphorical devices by which we express with Literal action what we wish to feel and understand on a spiritual level. 

 Sometimes the understanding precedes the dramatization; sometimes the reverse is true. The point is that whether in studying the nature of the Manifestation Himself, His actions, His language, or His laws, we can observe the analogical tie between spiritual growth and physical action as each reenforces the other in a pattern of continuous growth. 

  If we can assume, then, that we have ascertained the validity of physical reality as a metaphorical teaching device and the fundamental  logic underlying its structure, we can proceed to the final consideration, the Abdu'l-Baha in Baha'i World Faith, p. 334.    2 Matthew 5:38 — 46.


<p926>

  necessity for such a process. 

 For even if this process of spiritual development and enlightenment works quite capably, why could there not be a simpler, easier, less painful method of accomplishing the same task? Stated another way, if God is omnipotent and can create us in whatever way He wishes, why did He not create us already spiritualized, already in a state of understanding? 

 If the question seems presumptuous, especially in the light of having examined the divine bestowals of this creation, it is not; Baha'u'llah treats this question when He explains the following: 

He Who is the Day Spring  

 of Truth is, no doubt, fully capable of rescuing from such remoteness wayward souls and of causing them to draw nigh unto His court and attain His Presence. 

 'If God had pleased He had surely made all men one people.' His purpose, however, is to enable the pure in spirit and the detached in heart to ascend, by virtue of their own innate powers, unto the shores of the Most Great Ocean, that thereby they who seek the Beauty of the All-Glorious may be distinguished and separated from the wayward and the perverse.1 

 In effect, to create already spiritualized creatures is to produce automatons incapable of appreciating what they have because they have not discovered it nor have they experienced anything else. Likewise, were the spiritual reality more apparent on this plane, man would have no sense of personal recognition  and perception, since this reality would be obvious to all alike. 

 By veiling spiritual reality in a physical garb, by removing the essential reality of things one step from the vision of men, God has enabled us to have every opportunity to come to this knowledge and also have the bounty of recognition together with an awareness of the contrast between illusion and reality. This change from darkness to light, from ignorance to understanding, can provide more than a few moments  of elation and reward; it can provide us with the impetus to continue our ascent and the tools of discernment with which to achieve that objective. 

 But perhaps the most important justification  for the necessity of physical reality is Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 158. 

 the nature of the next world. For example, were there oniy two levels of existence in the next world, a Heaven for those who succeed and a Hell for those who fail, or even if there were various sorts of Dantean circles within these categories, then possibly God could create us already spiritual, and we would not have lost much. In fact, in view of the literal pitfalls we might avoid, such a creation would be much preferred. But in the Baha'i Writings we are told that there is no static existence in the next world, no relegation to an eternal abode within some fixed state of existence. Whether in this world or the next, we are constantly changing, it is to be hoped in a positive way, and the point of transition we call death does not end the process of spiritual development nor does it end our need to utilize the important and essential faculty of discernment with its accompanying tools of volition and action. There is no end point, no state in which we are finally and completely perfected: Both before and after putting off this material form, there is progress in perfection, but not in state Hence, as the perfections of humanity are endless, man can also make progress in perfections after leaving this world.2 

 Even if we have not used well these necessary tools of spiritual growth, even if we have in this life neglected our essential nature, it may be possible to develop these faculties in the next world: It is even possible that the condition of those who have died in sin and unbelief may become changed Thus as souls in this world, through the help of the supplications, the entreaties, and the prayers of the holy ones, can acquik development, so is it the same after death. Through their own prayers and supplications they can also progress; more especially when they are the object of the intercession of the Holy Manifestations .~ 

 This distinction between the concept of the afterlife as depicted in the Baha'i Writings and the traditional conceptions of other religions is a crucial one. Were man's destiny to attain one unchanging state of being, one explicit

  level of growth, then such development could conceivably be accomplished by the provision of an exacting canon of rules and guidelines. However, since we are as human souls, whether in this world or the next, always in a state of becoming, a set code of behavior would be impossible for several reasons. First of all, we must constantly aim higher. What was admirable, impressive, and progressive yesterday may be regressive today. 

 Secondly, no two situations or people are exactly the same, and no guidelines, no matter how tediously drawn, could take into account all of these variables. 

 Third, what is frequently required of us for our advancement is not a bold and courageous surpassing of our previous day's goals, but a finely chosen path of moderation or balance between two unhealthy extremes of response, such as the courage that lies between foolhardiness and cowardice, the joy between oppressive seriousness and insipid frivolity, or the wise guidance between unfeeling judiciality and permissive laxity. 

 In each of these cases what is clearly required is a faculty of discernment and judgment, not a blind adherence to dogma. Baha'u'llah admonishes us to evaluate our progress on a daily basis, and with each new assessment, we must decide what is progressive and yet not so far beyond our grasp that we will unwisely frustrate our determination to strive. Likewise, no handbook  to personal conduct can take into account  the exigencies of every situation, and perhaps this accounts for the fact that Baha'u'llah revealed relatively few specific laws regarding personal behavior. What He did create are decision-making institutions which have the capacity to consider the variables in a given situation, and He left an abundance of instructional Writings which can help to foster this same capacity in the individual. 

 Simply to follow a code of laws would require great effort and sacrifice, but to nurture the faculties of judgment, discernment, and understanding, in addition to adhering to basic laws, requires a completely different kind of effort. At the same time, it can yield a wholly different kind of reward, the recognition of Him Whose Presence we strive to attain, and this understanding, as we have already observed, is part of the avowed purpose of our creation. 

 It becomes clear, then, that our development is almost completely contingent on our utilization of this metaphorical process which has been provided for our advancement. What becomes equally clear is that to learn how to use this device, we must rely on our own volition and, at least in the initial stages of our growth, participate actively, enthusiastically,  but wisely in the physical reality which contains these analogies. 

 No doubt there are a myriad justifications for the wisdom of the physical universe and its capacity to teach us, but one final requisite for the proper use of this instructional device should be mentioned. 

 Our association with the metaphorical world must incorporate detachment, which is both a quality and a process. As a quality, the term detachment denotes the capacity to use the physical analogues without becoming infatuated with them. 

 As a process, the term implies a gradual relinquishing of our reliance on the physical vehicle to accomplish spiritual development. 

 In other words, detachment requires that our reliance on the physical experience be purposely shortlived. 

 Like the water that primes a pump, the physical lessons serve to initiate understanding and other essential spiritual tools. 

 But as our growth progresses, we should relate less and less directly to the physical analogue in order to understand the abstraction and express our development. 

 In the beginning we are like young lovers, attracted to the literal vehicle which has conveyed the abstract feelings and emotions. We find it difficult to disassociate the idea from the metaphorical vehicle just as the lovers cannot differentiate their love from the physical expression of that feeling. But as the lovers mature, they must relinquish their dependency on the bodies to convey this spiritual bond and must recognize the true source of their attraction to one another. 

 So must we in our development become more and more aware of the reality that is expressing  itself through the physical world, and thus become less and less needful of relating to that spiritual reality through the phenomenal metaphor. 

 For example, we are told in the Writings of all religions that one of the most dangerous distractions and detriments to our advance


<p928>
928                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ment is the love of self, which is expressed metaphorically by attachment to the physical metaphor for self, our body. When we become  overly concerned about our physical appearance, we may be forgetting that our ultimate reality is the soul which is temporarily  expressing itself through that corporeal metaphor. When we love that vehicle for itself or see it as synonymous with the tenor, we are becoming attached to the metaphor and forgetting the analogy. 

 To safeguard against just such a misuse of the physical experience, the Creator has provided us with a number of metaphorical reminders of our true nature and essential reality. The most intriguing of these is the aging process. 

 At almost the precise point when our physical bodies have reached their peak, we are as intellectual and spiritual beings just beginning to comprehend fully what we are supposed to be accomplishing on this plane of existence. Stated simply, just as we begin to strive for spiritual growth, our metaphorical self begins to crumble before our eyes. We may miss the point of our earthly mission and attempt to become attached  to the metaphorical self; but this divinely ordained process is daily teaching us that our attachment is doomed, that we are in the long run going to be detached whether we like it or not. 

 Thus, if we desire growth as our goal in life, the only kind of growth available that has any lasting value is spiritual growth, and if this development progresses as it can and should, the deterioration of the physical self together with the deterioration of our capacity to relate to the entire physical classroom, will parallel a corresponding increase in our spiritual faculties so that at the moment of transition from the physical world to the 'real world', our final detachment from the wornout metaphor  will occur at the precise instant that we can no longer use it anyway: The nature of the soul after death can never be described, nor is it meet and permissible to reveal its whole character to the eyes of men. The 

Prophets and Messengers    

 of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth. 

 The purpose underlying their revelation hath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the 

Most High.1

            3. REMEMBERING BERNARD LEACH

                    TRUDI SCOTT

  I F you had your life to live all over again, what would you change?' 

 This question was put to Bernard Leach during the Last year of his life. His instantaneous reply: 'Nothing, except myself, I hope.' 
    'A change for the better?'

 'Of course. Deeper, wider, truer, more loving. 

 When I went into hospital nine years ago and very nearly died, what did I learn? That I had never been as kind as those who were kind to me. And I felt shame at myself for not having been more thoughtful, more kind, more generous. 
It did make a difference.' 

 The interview was for a 'Profile' of Bernard Leach C.H., C.B.E., for the overseas  service of the British Broadcasting Corporation which was broadcast to over forty countries. 

 Many times I have been asked what I remember most about Bernard Leach: it was his humility. 

 He used to say, pointing his long finger upwards, 'It's the "I", not the I., I remember vividly his miraculous recovery from that serious illness in 1969. The doctors and the specialist did not expect him to live. He was eighty-three. 

 But those Baha'is who were close to him at the time had no doubts. 

 This was a spiritual progression.  There was even a Baha'i nurse who had just arrived at the hospital to take part of her training. I was committed to a demanding job that weekend in August. I knew he was gasping for breath with the help of oxygen. 

 My prayers took me to the typewriter. 'You are suffering like the Bab and Baha'u'llah for the love of God because He has great things for you to do. 

 Be content with the love of God. Everyone, everywhere is praying for you and willing you to get better.' This message I sent in large type, to be read to him by a very dear friend. 

 I was told that be changed colour afterwards. 

 In the evening I received the wording of a cable from the Universal House of Justice assuring Bernard of loving prayers. Early the next morning I was allowed into his hospital room for the few minutes I needed. 

 'I've been very ill,' he said between gasps for breath. 

 'I know,' I said. 'Don't talk, listen.' I placed my hand on his shoulder. 

 'Everyone is praying for you on Mount Carmel. 

 They are praying at the J-Ioiy Shrines for your recovery. Then I left him, knowing that he would draw comfort from the thought of those prayers. About a week or so later when I visited him he showed me the following lines that he had written: 

      In Gratitude             

  Oh, let me out Into the garden there I want to put down My shrunken hand To the green grass Yet once again Before I lie quiet Under the sod. 

 Many voices rose gently To Him, the Lord God, Who looked down in mercy And said, 'Spare the rod.' 

 In this room Where I have known Such pain and joy I felt the tremor Of those prayers All the way from 

Here to Carmel.          

 o God, wilt Thou Accept my thanks From here to Heaven? 

  When Bernard Leach was born in Hong Kong in 1887 his mother died, and he was taken by his grandparents to live with them in Kyoto where his grandfather was a professor of English at the university. 

 Bernard was educated in England, and at the Slade School of Art in London he met his lifelong friend, Reginald Turvey whom the Guardian later referred to as 'the spiritual father of the

Baha'is of South Africa'.  

 When Bernard returned to Japan in 1909 with the first etching press ever to reach that country (he planned to make a living teaching etching) he wanted to find out more about Eastern art and life. He speaks of his experience in 1911 when he met a group of artists and poets and first saw pots being made. 

 'One was taken out from the kiln, red hot, with long-handled tongs, dipped into a bucket of cold water, and it did not break. 

 I thought, "Isn't it exciting! I want to do that; I believe I could learn to do that. I wonder if I could get a teacher? 

 I did Before he left Japan in 1920 some of his friends presented him with a book entitled An English 

Artist in Japan. The       

 prophetic tribute written by Soetsu Yanagi, the founder of the Japanese Craft Movement, concludes with these words: 'When he leaves us we shall have lost the one man who knows Japan on its spiritual side. I feel very sad that he is going, but I hope when he returns to his own land he will be able to represent the East in a more just way than has yet been done, and that not oniy in words will he be able to show his affection, but in his works. I consider his position in Japan, and also his mission in his own country, to be pregnant with the deepest meaning. 

 He is trying to knit the East and West together by art, and it seems likely that he will be remembered as the first to accomplish as an artist what for so long mankind has been dreaming of bringing about I desire distinction for you     were the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed to the Baha'is. 

 Fifty years after Bernard Leach left Japan he was honoured by the World Crafts Council at a gathering in Dublin. In 1974 he received the Japan Foundation Cultural Award; he had already been given, in 1966, the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class, the highest honour the Japanese government bestows upon a foreigner. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1962 and, in 1973, in an audience with Her 

Majesty Queen Elizabeth    

 at Buckingham Palace, he was made a Companion of Honour. 

 During these later years retrospective exhibitions of his work were held both in Japan (1966) and in England (1977). During the opening week of his exhibition in London's Victoria and Albert Museum printed invitations  were made available to visitors for a Baha'i talk given by him at the Commonwealth Institute on 'My life, my work and my belief'. 

 Many people attended that meeting and mention of the Baha'i Faith was made in some of the press reports. 

 These years also saw the publication of several books written by Bernard Leach including Drawings, Verse and Belief in 1973 and, in 1978, Beyond East and West, which he considered to be his most important literary  work. This book, the last two chapters of which are devoted to the Faith — 'The Mountain of God' and 'Stepping Stones of Belief' — was also published in America and has been translated into Japanese. Many seeds must have been and still are being sown through this testament of faith. 

Reviews of Beyond East     

 and West in many countries mentioned his Baha'i belief and paid tribute to him. The reviewer of the Birmingham Post wrote: 'I have never met Bernard Leach. I feel that, having seen this last exhibition and having enjoyed every page of this enlightening and loving book, and having as it were travelled with him through time, sharing his feelings and experiences and friendships, I now already do know, and intimately, this great man, respected and indeed honoured all the world over It is a book to be delighted in, not just by potters such as Leach himself, or even by artists and craftsmen in general, but by anyone who cares about the joy of the one life we all share — all roads meeting, as we are reminded, on the mountain of God It was not possible for Bernard in his book of memoirs to include all his Ba1P'f activities over the years. Wherever he travelled he tried to keep some time for talks on the Faith. While exhibiting in South America — in Caracas and Bogota — he was tendered a special reception in Colombia to which several Baha'is  were invited. 

His pamphlet, My Religious 

 Faith, written in Japan in 1953, has been translated into Japanese and is still being used. A copy was presented to Princess Chichibu by Abdu'l-Baha Rhhiyyih Kh~num when she visited her while touring Japan in 1978.

December                  

 1973 he scrawled with a thick pen:

 Not to see a human face again. 

 Not to see a line on paper drawn.

 Awake, awake, the inner eyes, Love more, not less, The memories of human sight, See with, not through. 

  The spiritual awareness which grew with his blindness was an inspiration to visitors who came from far and wide to see him. He talked much about the Faith. One potter declared her belief in Baha'u'llah upon returning to America after spending a few days with him in St. Ives, Cornwall. 

 It was important to him to leave this world with all work done. 'Death as.a friend, death as a doorway', he wrote to a Baha friend after completing his manuscript of Beyond East and West. 

 It was a long time since 1914 when he had first heard of the Baha'i 

Faith from Agnes Alexander

 in Japan and, in that same year, had written: 'I have seen a vision of the marriage of East and West, and far off down the Halls of Time I heard the echo of a childlike

  4. THE CONCEPT OF SPIRITUALITY1

             WILLIAM S. HATCHER

       Introduction               

 FIIUMAN history has witnessed the birth, proliferation, and death of countless religions, belief systems, and philosophies. Though the generating impulse for each of these systems is undoubtedly related to numerous particular cultural and psychological factors, there runs through virtually all of them the common idea that man is not, in his naturally given human state, whole or complete. The concomitant to this belief is the idea that man must undergo some process of completion, some discipline of self-definition. 

 Such a process is usually regarded by its exponents as the basic purpose of man's existence, for through it man is seen to acquire or develop what is essential and universal, and not merely accidental and local, within the range of human potentiality. By this process, he defines what he truly is by becoming what he most truly can be. The process is often described as one of 'salvation', of being lifted above the condition of unregeneration (or spiritual death) to the plane of a superior reality. 

 The revealed religions have been major sources of such salvation concepts, spiritual philosophies, and spiritual disciplines. 

 Historically,  the revealed religions would seem to be united in affirming, each in its own particular way, that there is an objectively real spiritual dimension to the universe, and that this spiritual dimension of existence is for man the most fundamental and the most important aspect of reality. However, the revealed religions also appear, at least at first glance, to exhibit a disturbing degree of difference in their respective views of the exact nature of this spiritual reality and of how man should relate properly to it. Moreover, most of the traditional systems of religious belief appear now to have crystalized into rigid social patterns and dogmatic attitudes of thought and belief with which the modern ethos of rapid social and intellectual change seems incompatible. 

 The changes in modem-day society are being 1     Reprinted by permission of the author from Baha'i Studies, vol. 11, 1982. © 1982 

Association for Baha'i     
Studies, Ottawa, Canada.   

 wrought primarily by a highly efficient, powerful, and established science which owes little or nothing to established religion. 

 Whereas the religions, for the most part, continue to press harder and harder their mutually contradictory claims each to possess an absolute and unchanging truth which admits no compromise,  science is based squarely on the idea that truth is relative and progressive, that what is useful and productive in the realm of ideas and techniques today may be obsolete and unproductive tomorrow. Thus, traditional religion has come to abhor and fear change while science thrives upon it. Yet, science and technology have not given man the sense of wholeness he has so long been seeking, even though they have given him a vastly increased power to control and manipulate his physical environment. 

 The sense of incompleteness and the conscious need for transcendence, for contact with some deep spiritual reality, are widespread in our society. 

 Indeed, hardly at any other time of history or in any other culture has the sense of spiritual inadequacy been so acute as is currently the case in industrialized, high-technology, 

Western culture. But       

 if contemporary  man turns to religion for enlightenment, he too often finds dogmatism, which his mind cannot accept, or mindless emotionalism which is not worthy of acceptance. 

 From the modern perspective, each of the great religions appears as a system which was largely successful in satisfying the spiritual and social needs of a certain people or culture during a previous era of history, but which is no longer adequate to meet the needs of humanity in the present critical period of history. Thus, modern man is caught in a serious dilemma with regard to fundamental spiritual questions. On the one hand, the highly efficient science he has so successfully developed serves in part to deepen his moral and spiritual needs — needs that science alone cannot satisfy.2 

 On the other hand, most of 2  For example, powerful new techniques for manipulating such things as the human genetic endowment raise novel and acute ethical questions concerning their proper and responsible use.

  the traditional religious forms, attitudes and concepts now appear obsolete and irrelevant. 

 This modern dilemma is addressed by several of the fundamental principles of the historically recent Baha'i Faith. The Baha'i principle of the unity of science and religion holds that religious truth, like scientific truth (or truth in general), is relative and progressive.  It accepts unreservedly that 'If religious beliefs and opinions are found con triiry to the standards of science they are mere superstitions and imaginations.' 

 A In particular, with regard to spiritual questions the Baha'i Faith rejects a dogmatic approach: It affirms that there are spiritual realities governed by lawful relationships, and it invites each individual to assume a scientific attitude and to seek out and test for himself these spiritual truths.2 

 Concerning the great world religions, the Baha Faith teaches that they all derive from one common source, namely, that one, ultimate,  creative force responsible for the phenomena of the universe, that force we call God. 

 Baha'is hold that the founding figures of these great religious systems (e.g., Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Zoroaster, Muhammad) were all chosen channels or true spokesmen for this unique God, and that differences in Their teachings are due primarily to the varying requirements of the cultures and ages in which these systems were originally promulgated. Other significant doctrinal differences among these systems, as they are currently elaborated, are attributed to inaccuracies and distortions  gradually introduced by their followers in the course of their evolution as social systems after the death of their Founders.3 However, the essential spiritual message of Abdu'l-Baha iii Ba/id'!

 2  The present article consists in a rather detailed discussion  of certain aspects of the Baha'i conception of these spiritual truths and realities, but with little or no attempt to explain the basis upon which such a-concep-tion rests. This latter task was the objective of a previous effort by the present writer, published as 'The Science of Religion,' Baha'i Studies, vol. 2, rev. ed., 1980. 

 Also, one should not forget that, except for the more historically recent of these systems (such as Islam), we have no direct access to the exact words or the pure form of the original teachings as given by the Founder. Moreover, the various interpretations which theologians and thinkers have subsequently attached to those written records which do exist are conditioned and limited by various cultural factors and cannot, therefore, be regarded as surely authentic representations of the thought of the Founder. 

 these systems is affirmed to be universal and common to all. 

 The Baha'i Faith views itself as deriving from the most recent of these revelation events, as the latest chapter in the (unending) book of religion, so to speak. 

 Baha'u'llah (1817 — 1892), Founder of the Baha'i Faith, put forth these and other teachings in a series of over 100 books and manuscripts written primarily between 1853 and His death in 1892. 

 Thus, Baha'is feel that traditional religions are perceived by modern man as so unsatisfactory partly because some of their teachings are laden with culture-bound patterns and concepts (e.g., the dietary and penal laws of Judaism and Islam) and partly because of manmade distortions and corruptions which have crept in over the years. Religious dogmatism  represents the arrogant attempt to transform a relative and partial conception of truth into an absolute and unchanging system, binding the whole of mankind for all human history. 

 According to the Baha'i understanding  of the dynamics of God-created human nature, no such fixed system could ever be adequate for mankind. 

 The Baha'i system itself is viewed as responding to the needs of mankind in the present hour, but not for all future history. 

 Baha hold that the basic spiritual message common to the revealed religions is progressively  elaborated and more fully articulated in each successive revelation. 

 One would therefore  expect that the Baha'i Faith, if it is indeed the most recent divinely inspired articulation of spiritual truth to mankind, would contain a fuller elaboration and a deeper expression of this truth. 

 I believe that such is the case, and in the following pages I have quoted liberally, and sometimes at length, from the Baha'i Writings in an effort to convey to the reader some of the incredible spiritual riches they contain. Yet, all of the ideas and opinions expressed herein should be strictly regarded as nothing beyond the attempt of one mind to grasp some of the deeper meanings latent in the profound Writings of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, and Shoghi Effendi. In an effort to limit the scope of this monograph to reasonable proportions and to achieve an orderly exposition, I have consistently focused on the concept of spiritu

This work does not attempt in any way to be a manual for attaining spirituality but seeks only to gain, insofar as is possible, a clearer conception of what is implied in attaining it. Of course, attaining any goal is easier when we have a clear conception of what its attainment involves. I have offered the present text for publication only in the hope that it may contribute in some measure to the common task we all have of trying to express our spiritual understanding to each other, especially as I have already richly benefited from the insights and reflections of so many in this regard. 
                          
   I. The Nature of Man      
                          
1.   The Basic Components 

 of Man's Character The Baha'i Writings articulate a model of human nature and functioning which sees man as the product of two basic conditions, the physical (material) and the spiritual (non-material). 

 The physical dimension of man's existence derives from his genetic endowment, determined at conception, plus the interaction of this configuration with the environment. This interaction produces an internal, physical milieu which is unique to each individual, though sharing common features with all members of the human species. The spiritual dimension of man's nature derives from the existence of a nonmaterial  entity, the soul, which is individualized, it is explained, at the moment of conception. 

 Just as the physical body of man has various physical capacities, so the soul has its capacities, called spiritual capacities of man. Among the most important spiritual capacities mentioned in the Baha'i Writings as characteristic of man are those of the intellect or understanding, the heart or feeling capacity, and the will (the capacity to initiate and sustain action). 

 The interactions of the individual with his environment affect not only his body but his soul as well. 

 They develop both the genetically given physical capacities and the initially given spiritual capacities. 

 These interactions  may be called learning or education, and they give rise to a third aspect of man's total character, an aspect that is both physical and spiritual. 

 In sum, there are three essential aspects of the character of man: his genetic endowment,  which is purely physical; his soul and its capacities, which are purely spiritual; and education, which is both physical and spiritual.' 

 In Some Answered Questions, 'Abdu'l-Baha speaks of these three basic aspects of man's character: 'He [man] has the innate character, the inherited character, and the acquired character  which is gained by education. 

 'With regard to the innate character, although  the divine creation is purely good, yet the varieties of natural qualities in man come from the difference of degree; all are excellent, but they are more or less so, according to the degree. So all mankind possess intelligence and capacities, but the intelligence, the capacity and the worthiness of men differ... 

 'The variety of inherited qualities comes from strength and weakness of constitution —  that is to say, when the two parents are weak, the children will be weak; if they are strong, the children will be robust 'But the difference of the qualities with regard to culture is very great, for education 1 According to the Baha'i conception, the soul of each individual is eternal while the body, composed as it is of elements, is subject to physical decomposition, i.e., death. 

 Thus, the soul is the true source of the individual's consciousness, personality, and self. 

 The soul does not depend on the body but rather the body is the instrument of the soul during the period of earthly existence when the soul and the body are linked together. 

 The Baha Writings also make unequivocally clear the Baha'i belief that each human soul is not preexistent but is 'individualized' at the moment of conception. 

 Baha'is do not, therefore, believe in reincarnation — the doctrine that the same individual soul returns in different bodies to live different or successive earthly lives. It is explained rather that the soul's progress after the death of the physical body is towards God and that this progression takes place in other, purely spiritual (i.e. nonmaterial) realms of existence. 

 Of course, we cannot see the soul since it is not physical, but we can deduce its existence from the observable effects it produces. Roughly speaking, we can observe that the physical endowments of the higher apes, and, in particular, their central nervous systems, do not differ substantially from man's. Yet such beings seem incapable of the conscious, self-aware, deliberate intellection which characterizes man. 

 At best, they seem capable only of 'reactive' conditioned response rather than the imaginative, self-initiated thought of man, involving as it does long chains of deduction, and anticipation of and adaptation to imagined future events (i.e., hypotheses).

  has great influence Education must be considered as most important, for as diseases in the world of bodies are extremely contagious,  so, in the same way, qualities of spirit and heart are extremely contagious. Education has a universal influence, and the differences caused by it are very great. 

 From this, and other similar passages in the Baha'i Writings, it is clear that the innate character derives from the capacities of the soul while the inherited character derives from the individual's genetic endowment. Once fixed, these two elements of man's character remain unchanged, but the process of education enables man to develop these capacities either to a relatively high degree or to a relatively low degree, thus producing significant differences in character not attributable  solely either to heredity or to innate spiritual capacity. 
                           
2.  Spirituality Defined   

 We have used the word 'capacity' in referring both to the spiritual and to the physical endowments of the individual. The word connotes a potential, something to be fulfilled or accomplished (and something that is capable of fulfillment and accomplishment). Indeed, it is clear that the individual, at his birth into this world, is capable of manifesting very few of the qualities possessed by the mature adult human being. We know, moreover, that unless the infant is properly cared for and provided with a host of support systems and a growth-inducing milieu, he will never exhibit such qualities. Life, then, is a growth process. 

 Man begins the process as a little bundle of potential and proceeds, for better or worse, to develop his potential through the process of education (considered broadly as the sum of all environmental influences  on the individual plus the individual's reaction to these influences). 

 According to Baha'i teachings, the very purpose of man's life is the proper, harmonious, and full development of spiritual capacities. 

 This is the most worthwhile possible  goal since spiritual capacities, being part of the immortal soul (see note 1), will eternally endure while the body and its capacities  will not. However, the body is the

Questions (Wilmette:

 instrument of the soul's development in this earthly life, and so physical health and development cannot be safely neglected but rather must be made to serve the primary goal of fostering the soul's progress. 

 Baha'u'llah expresses this truth succinctly and powerfully: 'Through the Teachings of this Day Star of Truth [The Manifestation or Prophet of God] every man will advance and develop until he attaineth the station at which he can manifest all the potential forces with which his inmost true self hat/i been endowed. 

 It is for this very purpose that in every age and dispensation the Prophets of God and His chosen Ones have appeared amongst men, and have evinced such power as is born of God and such might as only the Eternal can reveal. '2 The process of developing one's spiritual capacities is called spiritual growth or simply spirituality. 

 We can thus formulate a working (operational) definition of the concept of spirituality as follows: Spirituality is the process of the full, adequate, proper, and harmonious development of one's spiritual capacities. 

 Unspirituality, by contrast, is either the lack of development of these capacities, their imbalanced or inharmonious development (e.g., the development of one to the exclusion of dthers), or else the false (im-proper)  development and/or use of these capacities. 

 With this definition of spirituality in mind, we can also formulate a working definition of Baha'i morality: That which fosters and advances the process of spiritual development is good, and that which tends to inhibit it is bad. Every law, counsel or behavioural norm contained in the Writings of the Baha Faith can be understood in large measure from this perspective. 
                           
3.  The Duality of Human   
Nature                     

 The only component of man's character capable of change is that which is acquired through education, where the latter term is understood broadly to mean the sum of all influences on the individual resulting from his encounters with and reactions to his environment.  However, the human situation is such

936                 that not every influence, and most certainly not every one of our reactions to these influences, is conducive to spiritual progress. Thus, the process of spiritual growth involves learning how to make appropriate respdnses to various circumstances and how to initiate certain kinds of actions: spiritual growth is an educational process of a particular sort. 

 The experience of our life during the period when the body and the soul are linked is one of a tension between contradicting and opposing  forces. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha explains that this tension results from the duality of the physical and the spiritual in man's nature. On the one hand, man's body has legitimate physical needs which cry for satisfaction: food, shelter, companionship, and protection from threatening forces. However, in seeking to satisfy these needs, man is easily led to be possessive, aggressive, and insensitive to the needs of others. On the other hand, man's soul also has intrinsic needs that demand satisfaction. These needs are metaphysical and intangible. They incite the individual to seek meaning and purpose in Life and to establish the proper relationship with God, with himself, and with his fellow humans. 

 Though this proper relationship may, and indeed must, be expressed  through physical means, it also is essentially intangible. 

 It involves submission to the will of God, the acceptance of our dependence on a power higher than ourselves. It implies self-knowledge, the discovery both of our limitations and of our particular talents and capacities. 

 And it requires recognition of and respect for the rights of others. This means that we realize and understand that all other men have needs similar to our own and that we accept all the implications of this fact in our relations with and actions towards others. 

 Of course, the Baha Faith is certainly not the first belief system to recognize this duality in man's nature. But the Baha view of this duality is significantly different from certain views frequently attributed to other belief systems, for the Baha'i Faith does not superimpose an absolute (good — evil) value judgement  upon the duality, viewing all things spiritual as good and all things material as bad. The Baha'i Writings make clear that man can misuse his spiritual faculties just as easily as he can misuse his material ones. 

 At the same time, the material faculties of man (indeed all of man's natural capacities) are viewed as God-given and therefore intrinsically (metaphysically) good. 

 As moral categories, good and evil are relative terms: A given action on the part of an individual is relatively less good than another action if that other action would have been more favourable to the process of spiritual growth. Moreover, the Baha'i Writings lead us to understand that God judges human actions only with regard to those actions which are truly logically possible for the individual in the given circumstances. 

 To judge otherwise  would be tantamount to requiring of man that which is beyond his capabilities or, paraphrasing words of Baha'u'llah, to tasking a soul beyond its power.1 

 In other words, only the direction of the spiritual growth process is given absolutely: it is towards the (unattainable) ideal of Godlike perfection. 

 But the process itself is lived relatively by each individual according to his spiritual and material endowments plus the free will choices he makes in dealing with the particular circumstances of his life. Since only God knows truly what these endowments and circumstances are for any individual, only God can judge the degree of moral responsi-2 bility of the individual in any situation. 

 Here is the way that 'Abdu'l-Baha explains the essential and intrinsic goodness of all of man's capacities, material or spiritual: 'In creation there is no evil; all is good. Certain qualities and natures innate in some men and apparently blameworthy are not so in reality. 

 For example, from the beginning of his life you can see in a nursing child the signs of greed, of anger and of temper. Then, it may be said, good and evil are innate in the reality of man, and this is contrary to the pure goodness of nature and creation. The answer to this is that greed, which is to ask for something more, is a praiseworthy quality provided that it is used See ibid., p. 106. 

 2 This observation explains the time-honoured injunction expressed by virtually all religious prophets and thinkers that no man is capable of judging the spiritual or moral worth of any other individual. This has nothing to do with society's right to protect itself against antisQcial behaviour whether perpetrated deliberately by morally insensitive individuals, or involuntarily by sick or misguided individuals.

  suitably. So if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge, or to become compassionate, generous and just, it is most praiseworthy. 

 If he exercises his anger and wrath against the bloodthirsty tyrants who are like ferocious beasts, it is very praiseworthy; but if he does not use these qualities in a right way, they are blameworthy. 

 'Then it is evident that in creation and nature evil does not exist at all; but when the natural qualities of man are used in an unlawful way, they are blameworthy.'1 Thus, the main function of the body is to serve as an instrument of the soul during the time when the immortal soul is linked to the mortal body. 

 This period constitutes the first stage of an eternal growth process. 

 The body's capacities, when properly used, contribute to the process of spiritual growth. These material capacities are no more intrinsically  bad than the capacities of the soul itself. Both material and spiritual capacities become harmful if they are misused through false or improper development. 

 However, Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha do stress the fact that the material capacities must be rigorously disciplined (not suppressed) if they ~re to serve their intended purpose as vehicles for spiritual growth. 

 Since satisfying our physical needs can easily incite us to become aggressive towards others and insensitive to their needs, the individual must engage in a daily struggle with himself to maintain the proper perspective on life and its spiritual meaning.2 

  1 Some Answered Questions, p. 215. 

2 Also, the Baha'i Writings

 make totally clear the Baha disbelief in the objective existence of Satan or of any such evil power or force (Cf. Some 

Answered Questions, The Nonexistence
of Evil,' pp. 263 — 264).    

 It is explained that what man perceives as evil within himself is simply the absence of some positive quality (which lack is perhaps perceived in a particularly acute way if the individual suddenly finds himself in a situation where the missing quality would have been very useful). Similarly, strong or irrational urges are not, it is affirmed, the result of the action on us of some extrinsic evil force, but rather of subjective desires arising from within ourselves, possibly due either to a prior lack of proper discipline or to the existence of some deep need which we may have neglected to fulfil in a healthy way (or which has not, in any case, been properly fulfilled). 'Abdu'l-Baha explains that improper development can pervert our intrinsically good, natural (God-given) capacities into negative and destructive acquired capacities: capacity is of two kinds: natural capacity and acquired capacity. The first, which is the creation of God, is purely good. 

 but the acquired capacity has become the cause of the appearance More will be said later about the nature of this daily spiritual discipline. 

 The main point here is that the tension between the material and the spiritual in man is a creative tension purposely given by God, a tension whose function it is constantly to remind the individual of the necessity of making an effort in the path of spiritual growth. Moreover, the existence of the material body with its needs provides daily opportunities for the individual to dramatize through action the degree of spirituality he has attained and to assess realistically his progress.3 

 If man did not have the spiritual-material duality in his nature, he would be spared the unpleasant tension that often accompanies the struggle to take a step along the path of spiritual growth, but he would also be denied the opportunities for growth provided by this very duality. 
                           
4.  Metaphysical Considerations

 We have seen how the Baha'i concept of spirituality flows naturally and logically from a coherent concept of the nature of man and of God's purpose for man. It must be admitted, however, that a paradox seems to lie at the heart of this process, or at least of our experience of the process during this earthly life. 

 The paradox is that God has given man immediate and easy access to material rebiity while denying him such immediate access to spiritual realities. 

 This seems a curious thing for God to have done if, in fact, the most important aspect of reality is the spiritual one and if our basic purpose in life is spiritual. 

 If the spiritual dimension of man's existence is of evil. For example, God has created all men that they are benefited by sugar and honey and harmed and destroyed by poison. This nature and constitution is innate, and God has given it equally to all mankind. But man begins little by hide to accustom himself bo poison by taking a small quantity each day, and gradually increasing it, until lie reaches a point that he cannot live without a gram of opium each day. 

 The natural capacities are thus completely  perverted. 

 Observe how much the natural capacity and constitution can be changed until by different habits and training hey become entirely perverted. One does not criticize vicious people because of their innate capacities and nature, but rather for their acquired capacities and nature.' ibid., pp. 214 — 215. 

 For example, since everyone knows what the physical sensation of hunger is like, anyone who willingly sacrifices his own physical wellbeing to help feed others commands a certain respect and communicates a spiritual reality to others in a way that far transcends preaching or philosophical discourse.

  ultimately the most real, then why are we given immediate perception oniy of the less substantial portion of total reality? 

 Why, in short, are we called upon by God to pursue a spiritual purpose while being immersed in a sea of materiality? 

 To many people, this basic perception of our human condition is not just a paradox but an outright contradiction. It is impossible, they say, that there could be a world of unseen and unobservable spiritual realities so much less accessible than the world of material reality: the most obvious exphnation for the inaccessibility of spiritual reality is that it does not exist. 

 Whether or not the paradox is stated this strongly, it remains the basic stumbling block to atheists, agnostics, materialists, and positivists of whatever philosophical stripe in their approach to spiritual questions. Fop, even if one becomes convinced that there is a significant, nonmaterial dimension to objective reality, the rationale for its having been deliberately hidden from immediate access by a God who nevertheless holds us responsible for relating properly to it remains obscure. 

 Fortunately for our attempts to grasp the deeper significance of the Baha'i concept of spirituality, Baha'u'llah has explained in clear terms the divine purpose underlying this fundamental  feature of the human situation. 

 The explanation Lies in the principle of 'separation and distinction' by which God wishes individual moral and spiritual attainment to be the result of the individual's self-responsible and self-directed efforts. 

 Baha'u'llah affirms unequivocally that God could certainly have rendered spiritual truth and spiritual reality as irrefutably evident and as immediately accessible to our spiritual senses as is material reality to our physical senses. 

 But, had He done so, all men would have been forever bereft of one important experience: the experience of the state of spiritual deprivation. As the universe is now ordered, everyone can have the experience of moving from a position of relative doubt, insecurity, uncertainty, and fear towards  a position of relative certitude, security, knowledge and faith. 

 On this journey, we learn important lessons which would otherwise be denied us. We value true spirituality the more for having experienced, to whatever degree, its lack, and we are grateful for the privilege of having participated in and contributed to the process of its attainment. 

 All of this would not be possible if spiritual knowledge and perfection were simply our natural state of being from the moment of our creation. 

 Here is one passage in which Baha'u'llah explains the principle of separation and distinction: 'The purpose of God in creating man hat/i been, and will ever be, to enable him to know his Creator and to twain 

His Presence.              

 •  Whoso hat/i recognized the Day Spring of Divine guidance and entered His holy court hath drawn nigh unto God and attained His Presence. Whoso bath failed to recognize Him will have condemned himself to the misery of remoteness, a remoteness  which is naught but utter nothingness and the essence of the nethermost fire. Such will be his fate, though to outward seeming he may occupy the earth's loftiest seats and be established upon its most exalted throne. 

 'He Who is the Day Spring of Truth is, no doubt, fully capable of rescuing from such remoteness wayward souls and of causing them to draw nigh unto His court and attain His Presence. 

 'If God had pleased He had surely made all men one people.' His purpose, however, is to enable the pure in spirit and the detached in heart to ascend, by virtue of their own innate powers, unto the shores of the Most Great Ocean, that thereby they who seek the Beauty of the All-Glorious may be distinguished and separated from the wayward and perverse. Thus hat/i it been ordained by the all-glorious and resplendent Pen.... 

 'That the Manifestations of Divine justice, the Day Springs of heavenly grace, have when they appeared amongst men always been destitute of all earthly dominion and shorn of the means of worldly ascendancy, should be attributed to this same principle of separation and distinction which ani-mateth  the Divine

 Nay, all created things would be so dazzled and

  thunderstruck by ihe evidences of His light as to be reduced to utter nothingness.'1 From this passage, we can understand that the intangibility of spiritual realities is not an accident but rather a deliberate and fundamental  aspect of God's purpose for man. Of course, if God had created us with no spiritual inclinations or perceptions whatever, if He had denied us immediate access to any part of reality, material or spiritual, or if He had created us with spiritual and metaphysical longings impossible of genuine fulfillment, we would be unable to succeed in our basic task. By starting the eternal spiritual growth process as spiritual-material hybrids, having immediate access to material reality and being endowed with significant physical and intellectual  powers, we are able to learn the subtleties of spiritual development gradually. 

 By experiencing  firsthand the order and the lawfulness of the physical creation, we come to understand that the unseen spiritual realm is similarly ordered and governed by lawful, cause-and-effect relationships. 

 At first intuitively, then explicitly and intellectually, and finally through genuine spiritual experience and inner development, we learn to participate consciously in this spiritual order of things. It becomes a day-to-day reality having an immediacy equal to and even greater than the immediacy of physical experience. Indeed,  as Baha'u'llah explains, if we fulfill our responsibilities and learn our lessons well, we will be ready at the time of our physical death to pass easily into the purely spiritual realm. We will already have become familiar with its basic laws and modes of functioning and will therefore be prepared to take up our lives in that new realm and proceed with our growth process in a harmonious and satisfying manner: 

'The Prophets and Messengers

 of God have been sent down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth. 

 The purpose underlying their revela-ticrn  bath been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the 

Most High.'2

II.   The Process of Spiritual
Growth                    
1. Prerequisites for Spiritual
Growth                    

 Spirituality is the process of the proper development of man's innate spiritual capacities.  But how does this process start and how is it carried on? What is the relationship  between spiritual development and other kinds of development processes (e.g. formal schooling)? 

 Why do there seem to have been so few people who have thus conceived the purpose of their lives and dedicated themselves to the pursuit of spirituality? 

 Answers to these and other similar questions are given in the Baha'i Writings, but we need to proceed systematically to gain perspective. 

 Clearly the prime condition for embarking on the process of spiritual development is the awareness that the process is useful, necessary, and realistically possible: the individual  must become fully alert to the objective existence of the spiritual dimension of reality. 

 Since such spiritual realities as God, the soul, and the mind are not directly observable, man has no immediate access to them. He has only indirect access through the observable effects that these spiritual realities may produce. 

 The Baha'i Writings acknowledge this situation and affirm that the Manifestation (or Prophet) of God is the most important observable reality which gives man access to intangible reality: 'The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days being thus closed in the face of all beings, the Source of infinite grace. hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of the realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the human temple, and be made manifest unto all men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of 

His imperishable Essence. 

 These sanctified  Mirrors, these Daysprings of ancient glory are one and all the Exponents on earth of Him Who is the central Orb of the universe,  its Essence and ultimate Purpose.'3 2 ibid., pp. 156 — 157. For a parallel discussion of some of these points see 'The 

Metaphorical Nature of Physical

 Reality', by John S. Hatcher, Baha'i Studies, vol. 3,1977.

 of Certitude (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1954), pp. 99 — 100.


<p940>
940                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  In another passage, 'Abdu'l-Baha has said: 'The knowledge of the Reality of the Divinity is impossible and unattainable, but the knowledge of the 

Manifestations of God     

 is the knowledge of God, for the bounties, splendours and divine attributes are apparent  in Them. 

 Therefore, if man attains to the knowledge of the Manifestations of God, he will attain to the knowledge of God; and if he be neglectful of the knowledge of the Holy Manifestations, he will be bereft of the knowledge of God.' 
                          
      Thus, the Manifestations  

 constitute that part of observable reality which most readily leads man to the knowkdge and awareness of the spiritual dimension of existence. Of course, only those living in the lifetime of a Manifestation can observe Him at first hand, but His revelation and His Writings constitute permanent observable realities which enable us to maintain objective content in our beliefs, concepts and practices: 'Say: The first and foremost testimony establishing His truth is His own Self Next to this testimony is His Revelation. For whoso faileth to recognize either the one or the other He hat/i established the words He hath retealed as proof of His reality and truth.'2 Elsewhere in the Baha Writings, it is explained that everything in observable reality, when properly perceived, reveals some aspect  of God, its Creator. 

 However, only a conscious, willing, intelligent being such as man can reflect (to whatever limited degree) the higher aspects of God. The Manifestations of God, being the 'most accomplished, the most distinguished, and the most excellent'3 of men, endowed by God with transhuman spiritual capacities, represent the fullest possible expression of the divine in observable reality. 

 Thus, the first step in the path of spiritual growth is to become as intensely aware as possible of the reality of the spiritual realm of existence. The principal key to such an awareness is knowledge of the Manifestations of 

God.                      

 Indeed, since the Manifestations constitute Some Answered Questions, p. 222. 
2 Gleanings, p. 105.      
ibid., p. 179.            

 such a unique link between man and the unseen world of spiritual reality, knowledge of the Manifestations is the foundation of the whole process of spiritual development.4 This is not to say that real spiritual progress cannot take place before one recognizes and accepts the Manifestation.5 However, the Baha'i Writings do affirm that in order to progress beyond a certain level on the path of spirituality, knowledge of the Manifestation is essential. Sooner or later (in this world or the next), knowledge and acceptance of the Manifestation  must occur in the life of each individual. 

 The question naturally arises as to what step or steps follow the recognition of the Manifestation. 

Here again Baha'u'llah     

 is quite clear and emphatic: The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of 

Him Who is the Day Spring 

 of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hat/i attained unto all good; and whoso is deprived thereof, hath gone astray, though he be the author of every righteous deed. It behoveth every one who reacheth his most sublime suuion, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance  of Him Who is the Desire of the world. 

 These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable without the other.'6 Thus, even though the recognition of the Manifestation of God is described as equal to 'all good,' recognition alone is not a sufficient basis for spiritual growth. 

 The effort to con-'In 'In this regard, Baha'u'llah has said: 'Neither the candle nor the lamp can be lighted through their own unaided effort, nor can it ever be possible for the mirror to free itself from its dross. It is clear and evident that until a fire is kindled the lamp will never be ignited, and unless the dross is blotted out front the face of the mirror it can never represent the image of the sun nor jlect its light and glory.' 

 Gleanings, p. 66. He goes on to point out that the necessary 'fire' and 'light' are transmitted from God to man through the Manifestations. 

 In one of His works, Baha'u'llah describes the stage leading up to the acceptance of the Manifestations as 'the valley of search.' 

 It is a period during which one thinks deeply about the human condition, seeks answers to penetrating questions, and sharpens and develops one's capacities in preparation for their full use. It is a period of increasing restlessness and impatience with ignorance and injustice.

  form oneself to the standards of behaviour, thought, and attitude expressed by the various laws ordained by the Manifestation is also an intrinsic, inseparable part of the process. 1 The idea that great effort is necessary to the prosecution of the spiritual growth process occurs throughout the Baha'i Writings: 'The incomparable Creator hath created all men from one same substance, and hat/i exalted their reality above the rest of His creatures. 

 Success or failure, gain or loss, must, therefore, depend upon man's own exertions. 

 The more he striveth, the greater will be his progress.2 

 'Know thou that all men have been created in the nature made by God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. 

 Unto each one hath been prescribed a preordained measure, as decreed  in God's mighty and guarded Tablets. All that which ye potentially possess can, however, be manifested only as a result of your own volition.3 

 He hath entrusted every created thing with a sign of His knowledge, so that none of His creatures may be deprived of its share in expressing, each according to its capacity and rank, this knowledge. 

 This sign is the mirror of His beauty in the world of creation. The greater the effort exerted for the refinement of this sublime and noble mirror, the more faithfully will it be made to reflect the glory of the names and attributes of God, and reveal the wonders of His signs and knowledge. 

 'There can be no doubt whatever that, in consequence of the efforts which every man may consciously exert and as a result of the exertion of his own spiritual faculties, this mirror can be so cleansed. as to be able to draw nigh unto the meads of eternal holiness and attain the courts of everlasting fellowship. 

 '~ Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'I-flah~i stress that mankind has undergone a collective process of evolution by which it has now arrived at the threshold of maturity. 

 God now requires more of man, in particular that he assume responsibility for the process of self-development: 'For in this holy Dispensation, the crowning of bygone ages, and cycles, true Faith is no mere acknowledgement of the Unity of God, but the living of a life that will manifest all the perfections implied in such belief.' 'Abdu'l-Baha in Divine Art of Living (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1974), p. 25. 

 2 Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, pp. 81 — 82. 

 ibid., p. 149.       '~ ibid., p. 262. 

 'Personal effort is indeed a vital prerequisite to the recognition and acceptance of the Cause of God. No matter how strong the measure of Divine grace, unless supplemented by personal, sustained and intelligent effort it cannot become fully effective and be of any real and abiding advantage. 
    This last statement, from  

Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian

 of the Baha'i Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957, makes clear that recognition of and faith in the Manifestation of God are not simply unidirectional 'gifts' from God to man. 

 Rather, both involve a reciprocal relationship requiring an intelligent and energetic response on the part of the individual. 

 Nor is true faith based on any irrational or psychopathological impulse.6 

  2.  The Nature of the Process We have seen how the spiritual growth process may begin by acceptance of the Manifestation and obedience to his laws and principles. We need now to gain a measure of understanding of the nature of the process itself. 

 We have characterized spiritual growth as an educational process of a particular sort for which the individual assumes responsibility and by which he learns to feel, think, and act in certain appropriate ways. It is a process through which the individual eventually becomes  the truest expression of what he has always potentially been. 

 Let us consider several further quotations from the Baha'i Writings which confirm this view of the spiritual growth process.

(Wil-mette:  Baha'i Publishing

 Trust, 1956), pp. 382 — 383, where faith is defined to be conscious knowledge: 'By fafth is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds.' Of course, whenever man gains knowledge which contradicts his preconceived notions, he experiences inner conflict and may therefore initially perceive the new knowledge (and thus the new faith) as irrational in that it contradicts what he previously assumed to be true. But this initial perception is gradually overcome as continued experience furtt~er confirms the new knowledge, finally leading to an integration of the new with whatever was correct and healthy in the old. But this model of faith stands in significant contrast to the widely-held view that religious faith is essentially or fundamentally irrational (and blind) in its very nature.

942                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  'Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the utmost Thy majesty and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own inmost being, the station of the knowledge  of their own selves.'1 Here the 'duties' which God has pr~scribed for man are seen not as ends in themselves but rather as 'tokens,' in other words as symbols for and means towards another, ultimate end. This end is characterized as being a particular kind of knowledge, here called self-knowledge. 

 In the following, Baha'u'llah speaks similarly  of self-knowledge: 

'0 My servants! Could     

 ye apprehend with what wonders of My munificence and bounty I have willed to entrust your souls, ye would, of a truth, rid yourselves of attachment to all created things, and would gain a true knowledge of your own selves — a knowledge which is the same as the comprehension of Mine own Being. 

  One significant aspect of this passage is that true knowledge of self is identified with knowledge of God. That knowledge of God is identical with the fundamental purpose of life for the individual is clearly stated by Baha'u'llah  in numerous passages. For example: 'The purpose of God in creating man hat/i been, and will ever be, to enable him to know his Creator and to attain His Presence. To this most excellent aim, this supreme objective, all the heavenly Books and the divinely-revealed and weighty Scriptures unequivocally  bear witness.'3 Thus, while acceptance of the Manifestation of God and obedience to His ordinances is a necessary step which each individual must accomplish at some point in the spiritual growth process, these and other such duties are means to an ultimate end which is described as true self-knowledge. 

 This quality of self-knowledge is equated with knowledge of God, and knowledge of God is considered 1 Gleanings, pp. 4 — 5. 
2 ibid., pp. 326 — 327.     

  ibid., p. 70. See also note 9. 

 by Baha'u'llah as constituting the essential reason for man's existence. 

 All of this would seem to say that religion, in the final analysis, represents a cognitive discipline of some sort. But what kind of cognitive discipline could involve the full development of all man's spiritual capacities, and not just the mind? What kind of knowledge  is meant by the true knowledge of self and how can such knowledge be tantamount to knowledge of God? 

 Baha'u'llah gives the key to answering these important questions in an explicit statement clearly describing the highest form of knowledge and development accessible to man: 'Consider the rational faculty with which God hath endowed the essence of man. Examine thine own self, and behold how thy motion and stillness, thy will and purpose, thy sight and hearing, thy sense of smell and power of speech, and whatever else is related to, or transcendeth, thy physical senses or spiritual perceptions, all proceed from, and owe their existence to, this same faculty. 

 'Wert thou to ponder in thine heart, from now until the end that hath no end, and with all the concentrated intelligence and understanding  which the greatest minds have attained in the past or will attain in the future, this divinely ordained and subtle Reality, this sign of the revelation of the All-Abiding, All-Glorious God, thou wilt fail to comprehend its mystery or to appraise its virtue. 

 Having recognized thy powerlessness  to attain to an adequate understanding of that Reality which abideth within thee, thou wilt readily admit the futility of such efforts as may be attempted by thee, or by any of the created things, to fathom the mystery of the Living God, the Day Star of unfading glory, the Ancient of everlasting days. 

 This confession of helplessness which mature contemplation must eventually impel every mind to make is in itself the acme of human understanding, and marketh the culmination of man's development.'4 This passage seems to indicate that the ultimate form of knowledge available to man is represented by his total awareness of certain limitations which are inherent in his very ibid., pp. 164 — 165.

  nature or at least in the fundamental relationship between his nature and the phenomena of existence (including his own being and that of God). In particular, man must assimilate in some profound way the truth that the absolute knowledge of God and even of his own self lie forever beyond his reach. His realization of this truth is consequent to his having made a profound and accurate appraisal of his God-created  capacities and potentialities. Thus, in the last analysis, true self-knowledge appears as a deep and mature knowledge of both the limitations and the capacities of the self. Let us recall that attaining to this knowledge is said to require strenuous effort on the part of man and to involve the development of a11 the potential forces with which his inmost true self bath been endowed.'1 To gain a broader perspective on this question, let us compare the self-knowledge described here with human knowledge in general, hoping that such a comparison will help us to understand more clearly what is particular to true self-knowledge. 

 In general terms, a 'knowing situation' involves a subjectivity  (in this case that of man), some phenomenon which is the object of knowledge,  and finally those means and resources which the subject can mobilize in order to obtain the understanding he seeks. 

 If we agree to lump these last aspects of the knowing process under the general term 'method,' we arrive at the following schema: knowing subject method phenomenon Quite clearly, the knowledge which is ultimately  obtained from this process will depend on all three fundamental aspects of the knowing situation. It will depend on the nature of the phenomehon being studied (e.g., whether it is easily observable and accessible, whether it is complex or simple), on both the capacities and limitations of the knowing subject, and on the method used. In particular, the knowledge which results from this process will necessarily be relative and limited unless the knowing subject possesses some infallible method of knowledge. In this regard, it is important to note that the Baha Writings stress repeatedly that human beings (other than the Manifestations) have no such ibid., p. 68, previously quoted in Section 1.2 

 infallible method of knowledge and that human understanding of all things is therefore relative and limited.2 

 For example, in a talk given at Green Acre near Eliot, Maine in 1912, 'Abdu'l-Baha discusses the different criteria 'by which the human mind reaches its conclusions' .~ After a discussion of each criterion, showing why it is fallible and relative, 'Abdu'l-Baha states: 'Consequently, it has become evident that the four criteria or standards of judgement by which the human mind reaches its conclusions are faulty and inaccurate.' He then proceeds to explain that the best man can do is to use systematically all of the criteria at his disposal.4 

 In another passage, 'Abdu'l-Baha affirms: 'Knowledge is of two kinds. 

 One is subjective  and the other objective knowledge — that is to say, an intuitive knowledge and a knowledge derived from perception. 

 'The knowledge of things which men universally have is gained by reflection or by evidence — that is to say, either by the power of the mind the conception of an object is formed, or from beholding an ob]ect the form is produced in the mirror of the heart. The circle of this knowledge is very limited because it depends upon effort and attainment.'5 'Abdu'l-Baha then explains that the first kind of knowledge, that which is subjective and intuitive, is the special consciousness of the Manifestations: 'Since the Sanctified Realities, the supreme Manifestations of God, surround the essence and qualities of the creatures, transcend and contain existing realities  and understand all things, therefore, Their knowledge is divine knowledge, and not acquired — that is to say, it is a holy bounty; it is a divine revelation.'6 2 It is interesting that modern science and modern scientific philosophy take essentially the same view of human knowledge. I have elsewhere treated this theme at some length (see Rahd'i Studies, vol. 2, 'The Science of Religion,' 1980), but will not enter into the discussion of such questions here. 

 He explicitly mentions sense experience, reason, inspiration  or intuition, and scriptural authority. 

 The quoted passages are from 'Abdu'l-Baha, The Promulgation of the Universal Peace (Wilmette, Ill.: 

 Baha'i Publishing Trust, 2nd ed., 1982), pp. 253 — 255. 'Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 157.

  Here again we see that 'Abdu'l-Baha expresses the limited character of all human knowledge (in contrast to the unlimited knowledge  of the Manifestations deriving from their special superhuman nature). In yet another passage 'Abdu'l-Baha puts the matter thus: 'Know that there are two kinds of knowledge: the knowledge of the essence of a thing and the knowledge of its qualities. The essence of a thing is known through its qualities; otherwise, it is unknown and hidden. 

 'As our knowledge of things, even of created and limited things, is knowledge of their qualities and not of their essence, how is it possible to comprehend in its essence the Divine Reality, which is unlimited? 

 Knowing God, therefore, means the comprehension and the knowledge of His attributes, and not of His Reality. This knowledge of the attributes is also proportioned  to the capacity and power of man; it is not absolute.'1 It would seem clear from these and other similar passages from the Baha'i Writings that whatever distinctive characteristics the true knowledge of self (or, equivalently, the knowledge  of God) may have, it does not differ from other forms of knowledge with regard to degree of certainty. 

 It is not less certain than other forms of knowledge since all human knowledge (including the knowledge of God and of 'created and limited things') is relative and limited. 

 Nor does it differ from these other forms of knowledge by being more certain, as is clear from the passage above and from the passages of Baha'u'llah previously cited.2 

  1 ibid., pp. 220 — 221. 

 2 Some mystics and religious philosophers have contended that our knowledge of God is absolute and for that reason superior to the relative and limited knowledge obtained by science. Such thinkers offer mysticism as an alternative discipline to science. 

 It is important to realize that the Baha'i Faith does not lend support to such a view. In particular, concerning the inherent limitations of the individual's intuitive powers, however disciplined or well-developed, Shoghi Effendi has said: With regard to your question as to the value of intuition as a source of guidance for the individual; implicit faith in our intuitiye powers is unwise, but through daily prayer and sustained effort one can discover, though not always and fully, God's Will intuitively. 

 Under no circumstances, however, can a person be absolutely certain that he is recognizing God's Will, through the exercise of his intuition. It However, if we compare knowledge of God with other forms of knowledge, not from the point of view of degrees of certainty, but rather from the standpoint of the relationship between man as knowing subject on the one hand, and the phenomenon which is the object of study on the other, we can immediately  see that there is a tremendous difference. 

 In all sciences and branches of knowledge other than religion, the object of study is a phenomenon which is either inferior to man in complexity and subtlety (in the case of physics and chemistry) or on a level with man (in the case of biology, psychology, and sociology). 

 In either case, for each of these sciences the human knower is in a position of relative dominance or superiority which enables  him to manipulate to a significant degree the phenomenon being studied. 

 We can successfully  use these phenomena as instruments for our purposes. But when we come to knowledge of God, we suddenly find ourselves  confronted with a phenomenon which is superior to us and which we cannot manipulate. Many of the reflexes and techniques learned in studying other phenomena no longer apply. Far from learning how to manipulate God, we must learn how to discern expressions of God's will for us and respond adequately to them. It is we who now must become (consciously acquiescing) instruments for God's purposes.3 

  often happens that the latter results in completely misrepresenting the truth, and thus becomes a source of error rather than of guidance. 

Moreover, the Baha'i Writings

 clearly recognize that the human mind has a capacity for self-generated illusion which, if not recognized by the individual, can lead him into serious error: You yourself must surely know that modern psychology has taught that the capacity of the human mind for believing what it imagines, is almost infinite. Because people think they have a certain type of experience, think they remember something of a previous life, does not mean they actually had the experience, or existed previously. 

 The power of their mind would be quite sufficient to make them believe firmly such a thing had happened.' 

 (This latter passage is also by Shoghi Effendi and both statements are quoted in a letter written by the Universal House of Justice to an individual 

Baha'i.)                  

 In particular, the Manifestations of God represent objective and universally accessible expressions of God's will. 

 Humanity's interaction with the Manifestations provides an important opportunity to experience concretely a phenomenon which man cannot manipulate or dominate. 

 The Manifestations likewise provide a challenge to each individual's capacity to respond adequately to the divine will.

  Viewed in this perspective, the distinctive characteristic of knowing God, as compared with all other forms of (human) knowledge, is that the human knower is in a position of inferiority with respect to the object of knowledge.  Rather than encompassing and dominating  the phenomenon by aggressive and rnanipu-lative techniques, man is now encompassed by a phenomenon more powerful than himself. 

 Perhaps, then, one of the deep meanings of the true knowledge of self (which is equivalent to the knowledge of God) is that we are here confronted with the task of learning novel, and initially unnatural, patterns of thought, feeling, and action. We must retrain ourselves in a wholly new way. We must not oniy understand our position of dependence on God, but also integrate that understanding into our lives until it becomes part of us, and indeed until it becomes us, an expression of what we are. 

 In other words, the full, harmonious, and proper development of our spiritual capacities means developing these capacities so that we may respond ever more adequately, and with increasing sensitivity and nuance, to the will of God: The process of spiritual growth is the process by which we learn how to conform ourselves to the divine will on ever deeper levels of our being.1 

 From this viewpoint, conscious dependence upon God and obedience to His will is not a capitulation of individual responsibility, a sort of helpless 'giving up,' but rather an assumption of an even greater degree of responsibility  and self-control. We must learn through deep self-knowledge, how to be responsive to the spirit of God. 

 The ability to respond to God in such a wholehearted, deeply intelligent and sensitive  way is not part of the natural gift of any human being. What is naturally given to us is the capacity, the potential to attain to such a state. Its actual achievement, however, is consequent only to a persistent and strenuous effort on our part. The fact that such effort, and indeed suffering, are necessary to attain this state of spirituality makes life often Another important dimension of spirituality is service to the collectivity. The development of one's spiritual and material capacities makes one a more valuable servant. More will be said about this in a later section. 

 difficult.2 But the fact that it is truly possible makes of life a spiritual adventure a hundredfold  more exciting than any other physical or romantic adventure could ever possibly be. 

         George Townshend, a Baha'i 

 renowned for the spiritual quality of his personal life, has given a description of this state of spiritual-mindedness. 

 One senses that Townshend's statement is based on deep personal experience  as well as intelligent contemplation: 'When the veils of illusion which hide a man s own heart from himself are drawn aside, when after purgation he comes to himself and attains self knowledge and sees himself as he truly is, then at the same moment and by the same act of knowledge he beholds there in his own heart His Father who has patiently awaited His son's return. 

 'Only through this act of self completion, through this conclusion of the journey which begins in the kingdom of the senses and leads inward through the kingdom of the moral to end in that of the spiritual, does real happiness become possible. Now for the first time a man's whole being can be integrated, and a harmony of all his faculties be established. 

 Through his union with the Divine Spirit he has found the secret of the unifying of his own being. He who is the Breath of Joy becomes the animating principle of his existence. 
Man knows the Peace of     

God.'3                     

  One of Baha'u'llah's major works, The Book of Certitude, is largely devoted to a detailed explanation of the way in which God has provid&d for the education of mankind through the periodic appearance in human history of a God-sent Manifestation or Revelator. At one point in His discussion of these questions, Baha'u'llah gives a wonderfully  explicit description of the steps and stages involved in the individual's progress 2 Concerning the necessity of such suffering in the pursuit of spirituality, 'Abdu'l-Baha has said: 'Everything of importance in this world demands the close attention of its seeker. 

 The one in pursuit of anything must undergo difficulties and hardships until the object in view is attained and die great success is obtained. This is the case of things pertaining to the world. How much higher is that which concerns the Supreme Concourse!'

  towards full spiritual development. This portion of The Book of Certitude has become popularly known among Baha'is as the 'Tablet to the True Seeker,' although Baha'u'llah does not Himself designate the passage by this or any other such appellation. 

 In general terms, a 'true seeker' is anyone who has become aware of the objective existence of the spiritual dimension of reality, has realized that spiritual growth and development  constitute the basic purpose of existence,  and has sincerely and seriously embarked on the enterprise of fostering his spiritual progress. It is quite clear from the context of the passage that Baha'u'llah is primarily addressing those who have already reached the stage of accepting the Manifestation  of God and obeying His commandments. 

 Baha'u'llah begins by describing in considerable  detail the attitudes, thought patterns, and behaviour patterns that characterize a true seeker. He mentions such things as humility, abstention from backbiting and vicious criticism of others, kindness and helpfulness to those who are poor or otherwise in need, and the regular practice of the discipline of prayer and of meditation. 

 He concludes this descrigtion by saying 'These are among the attributes of the exalted, and constitute the hallmark  of the spiritually-minded When the detached wayfarer and sincere seeker hath fulfilled these essential conditions, then and only then can he be called a true seeker.'1 He then continues by describing both the quality of effort necessary to the attainment of spirituality  and the state of being which this attainment secures to the individual: 'Only when the lamp of search, of earnest striving, of longing desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love, of rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker's heart, and the breeze of His lovingkindness is wafted upon his soul, will the darkness of error be dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated, and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being. At that hour will the mystic Herald, bearing the joyful tidings of the Spirit, shine forth from the City of God resplendent as the The Book of Certitude, p. 195. 

 morn, and, through the trumpet-blast of knowledge, will awaken the heart, the soul, and the spirit from the slumber of negligence. 

 Then will the manifold favours and outpouring grace of the holy and everlasting Spirit confer such new life upon the seeker that he wilifind himself endowed with a new eye, a new ear, a new heart, and a new mind. He will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe, and will penetrate the hidden mysteries of the soul. Gazing with the eye of God, he will perceive within every atom a door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute certitude. He will discover in all things the mysteries of divine Revelation and the evidences of an everlasting manifestation. 

  Nor should the achievement of such a degree of spiritual development be considered an ideal, static configuration from which no further change or development is possible, as the following two passages from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha make clear: 'As the divine bounties are endless, so human perfections are endless. If it were possible to reach a limit of perfection, then one of the realities of the beings might reach the condition  of being independent of God, and the contingent might attain to the condition of the absolute. But for every being there is a point which it cannot overpass — that is to say, he who is in the condition of servitude, however far he may progress in gaining limitless perfections, will never reach the conditions of Deity. 

 'For example, Peter cannot become Christ. 

 2 ibid., pp. 195 — 196. Baha'u'llah's reference in this passage to 'absolute certitude' might be perceived at first as contradicting the strong statements regarding the limitations on human knowledge which we have earlier quoted. 

 However, this superficial perception is relieved when we reflect that 'certitude' refers to a (psycho-logical) state of being whereas the notion of 'degree of certainty' (and in particular the question of whether knowledge is relative or absolute) is concerned rather with the criteria of verification available to man as knowing subject. Thus, Baha'u'llah would seem to be saying that man can attain to a sense of absolute certitude even though his criteria of verification, and thus his knowledge, remain limited. Also, it is clear that such phrases as 'the eye of God' should be taken metaphorically and not literally. This metaphor, together  with other such phrases as 'new life' and 'absolute certitude,' convey a strong sense of the discontinuity between the respective degrees of understanding possessed by the individual before and after his attainment of true self-knowledge.

  All that he can do is, in the condition of servitude, to attain endless perfections ~Both before and after putting off this materialform, there is progress in perfection but not in state. There is no other being higher than a perfect man. But man when he has reached this state can still make progress in perfections but not in state because there is no state higher than that of a perfect man to which he can transfer himself. 

 He only progresses in the state of humanity, for the human perfections are infinite. Thus, however learned a man may be, we can imagine one more learned. 

 'Hence, as the perfections of humanity are endless, man can also make progress in perfections after leaving this world.'2 3. The Dynamics of the 

Spiritual Growth Process   
After contemplating Baha'u'llah's

 description of the state of being resulting from the attainment of true self-knowledge, it would be only natural to wish that this state could be achieved instantaneously, perhaps through some supreme gesture of self — renunciation or whatever. However, the Writings of the Baha'i Faith make it plain that this is not possible. By its very nature, true spirituality is something which can oniy be achieved as the result of a certain self-aware and self-responsible process of development. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha often responded to Bah~'~s who felt overwhelmed by the task of refining their character by stressing the necessity of patience and daily striving. 'Be patient, be as I am,' He would say.3 Spirituality was to be won 'little by little; day by day'.4 

 And again: 'He is a true Baha'i who strives by day and by night to progress and advance along the path of human endeavor, whose most cherished desire is so to live and act as to enrich and. illuminate the world, whose source of inspiration is the essence of Divine virtue, whose aim in life is so to conduct himself as to be the cause of infinite progress.

 when he attains unto such perfect gifts can it be said of him that he is a true Baha'i This last passage in particular would seem to indicate that one of the signs of an individual's maturity is his acceptance of the gradual nature of the process of spiritual growth and of the necessity for daily striving. Indeed, psychology has established that one important measure of maturity is the capacity to delay gratification, i.e., to work for goals whose attainment is not to be had in the short term. 

 Since spirituality is the highest and most important goal anyone can possibly have, it is natural that its achievement should call forth the greatest possible maturity on the part of the individual.6 

 In a similar vein, Shoghi Effendi has said that the 

Baha'is:                    

  should not look at the depraved condition of the society in which they live, nor at the evidences of moral degradation and frivolous conduct which the people around them display. They should not content themselves merely with relative distinction and excellence. Rather they should fix their gaze upon nobler heights by setting the counsels and exhortations of the Pen of Glory as their supreme goal. Then it will be readily realized how numerous are the stages that still remain to be traversed and how far off the desired goal lies — a goal which is none other than exemplifying heavenly morals and virtues.'7 In describing the experience of the individual  as he progresses towards this goal, 'Abdu'l-Baha has said: 'Know thou, verily, there are many veils in which the Truth is enveloped; gloomy veils; then delicate and transparent veils; then the envelopment of Light, the sight of which dazzles the eyes.' 

 8 Indeed, one of Baha'u'llah's major works, The Seven Valleys, describes in poetic and powerfully descriptive language the different stages of spiritual perception through which an individual may pass in his efforts to Divine Art of Living, p. 25. 

 6 This point of view on spirituality is in sharp contrast with the viewpoint found in many contemporary cults and Sects which stress instant gratification and irresponsibility  in the name of honesty and spontaneity.

  attain to the goal of spirituality.1 In the Tablet of Wisdom, Baha'u'llah says simply: 'Let each morn be better than its eve and each morrow richer than its yesterday.'2 

Elsewhere, Baha'u'llah      

 has urged man to live in such a way that each day his faith increases over the previous day. 

 All of these passages strongly reinforce the notion that spirituality is to be won only through a gradual process and is not to be attained by any once-and-for-all act of faith. 

 We want now to understand the dynamics of this process. 

 How do we even lake one step forward? Also, we need to understand how a gradual process can produce a change as radical as that described by Baha'u'llah in the passage quoted in the previous section (see note 41). 

 The answer to this last consideration is that the rate of change produced by the process is not constant. In technical language, the process is exponential and not linear. To say that a growth process is linear means that the rate of growth is unchanging. 

 In an exponential process, on the other hand, the rate of growth is very small in the beginning but gradually increases until a sort of saturation point is reached. When this point is passed, the rate of growth becomes virtually infinite, and the mechanism of the process becomes virtually automatic. 

 There is, so to speak, an 'explosion' of progress.3 

 As we examine the dynamics of the process of spiritual development we will see precisely how the exponential nature of the process can be concretely understood. 

 Let us turn, then, to an examination of these dynamics. 

 The main problem is to understand how the various capacities of the individual — mind,

Valleys and the Four       

Valleys (Wilmette: Baha'i  

 Publishing Committee, rev. ed., 1954).

Baha'u'llah (Haifa, Israel:

 compiled  by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, 1978), p. 138. 

 In an exponential process, the rate of growth at any given stage of the process is directly proportional to the total growth attained at that stage. Thus, as the process develops and progress is made, the rate of progress increases. 

 An example would be a production process such that the total amount produced at any given stage is double the total amount produced at the previous stage (imagine a reproduction process in which bacteria double each second, starting with one bacterium). 

 Since the double of a large number represents a much greater increase than the double of a small number, doubling is an example of an exponential law of progress. 

 heart, and will — are to interact in order to produce a definite step forward in the path towards full development. Basic to our understanding  of this obviously complex interaction are two important points that Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha both stress regarding the growth process/The first is that no one faculty acting alone is sufficient to produce results.4 The second point is that there is a hierarchical relationship between these faculties in which knowledge is first, love is second, and will is third. Let us discuss each of these points in turn. 

 As we have seen in Section I on the nature of man, each individual has certain basic, innate spiritual capacities, but in a degree and in a proportion which are unique to him. Moreover, the initial development of these innate capacities takes place under conditions over which the individual has very little control (e.g., the conditions of the family into which he is born, the social and physical surroundings to which he is exposed). 

 An important consequence of this universal, existential situation is that each one of us arrives  at the threshold of adulthood having developed a more or less spontaneous and unexamined pattern of responses to life situations.  This pattern, unique to each individual,  is an expression of his basic personality at that stage of his development.5 

  Baha'u'llah has stressed that the merit of all deeds is dependent upon God's acceptance (cf. 

A Synopsis and Codification

 of the KiM b-i-A qdas of Baha'u'llah, [Haifa, 

Israel: the Universal      
House of Justice, 1973],   

 p. 52), and 'Abdu'l-Baha has said that 'good actions alone, without the knowledge of God, cannot be the cause of eternal salvation, everlasting success, and prosperity, and entrance into the Kingdom of God.' 

 Some Answered Questions, p. 238. On the other hand, knowledge without action is also declared to be unacceptable: 'Mere knowledge of principles is not sufficient. We all know and admit that justice is good but there is need of volition and action to carry out and manifest it' 'Abdu'l-Baha in Foundations of World Unity (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing  Trust, 1945), p. 26. At the same time, love and sincere good intentions alone are also insufficient for spiritual progress, for they need to be guided by knowledge and wisdom and expressed through action.  Moreover, without true self-knowledge we may sometimes mistake physical attraction or self-centred emotional need as love and act upon it with negative results. 

 At this point in our development, it is difficult if not impossible to know how much of our mode of functioning  is due to our innate qualities and how much is due to the cumulative influence of external conditions. 

 Thus, our spontaneous response pattern may be a reasonably authentic expression of our true selves or it may contain significant distortions. It is only by moving on to the next

  Given the limited and relative nature of our innate spiritual capacities as well as the conditions under which they will have developed  up to this point in our lives, our personal response pattern will necessarily involve  many imbalances, immaturities and imperfections. 

 Moreover, because of the largely spontaneous and unselfconscious nature of our pattern, we will be unaware of many aspects of it. Thus, our attainment of true self knowedge will involve our becoming acutely aware of the internal psychic mechanisms of our responsd pattern. We must take stock of both the strengths and the weaknesses of our pattern and make deliberate efforts to bring it into harmony, balance, and full development. We must also begin to correct false or improper  development. 

 This is the beginning of a transformation or growth process for which we assume responsibility. 

 Until this point in our lives, our growth and development has been primarily in the hands of others. Though we have collaborated in the process with some degree of consciousness, nevertheless the major part has been beyond our control and indeed beyond our awareness. 

 We have been the relatively passive recipients of a process to which we have been subjected by others. Now we must become the agents and prime movers of our own growth process. This self-directed process is a continuation of the previously unconscious one, but it represents a new and significant stage in our lives. 

 This new, self-directed growth process is going to take time. Moreover, it is sometimes going to be painful, and in the beginning stages at least, very painful. 

 The new, more balanced functioning for which we begin to strive will appear at first to be unnatural since the spontaneous pattern we will have previously developed is the natural expression of our (relatively undeveloped and immature) selves. 

 In fact, one of the major problems involved in starting the process of spiritual growth is that we initially feel so comfortable with our spontaneous and unexamined mode of functioning. This is why it often happens that an individual becomes strongly motivated to begin the spiritual growth process oniy after stage of self-aware, self-directed growth that we can gain insight into this question. 

 his spontaneous system of coping has failed in some clear and dramatic way. 

 The realization that failure has occurred may come in many different forms. 

 Perhaps we are faced with a 'test,' a life situation that puts new and unusual strain on our defective response system and thus reveals to us its weakness. We may even temporarily break down, i.e., become unable to function in situations which previously posed no difficulties.  This is because we have become so disillusioned by our sudden realization of our weakness that we put the whole framework of our personalities into doubt. 

 Perceiving that things are wrong, but not yet, knowing just how or why, we suspend activity until we can gain perspective on what is happening. 

 1 Or, the perception of the inadequacy of our spontaneous system of functioning may result from our unanticipated failure at some endeavour. 

 We are then led to wonder why we anticipated a success that we were unable to deliver.2 

  1 If a person has been fortunate in the quality of spiritual education he has received during his formative years, his spontaneous system of functioning may be very good indeed compared with others in less fortunate circumstances.  If his spiritual education has been especially good, he will have already learned and understood the necessity of assuming the responsibility for his own spiritual growth process (and will have already begun to do so as• an adolescent). In such cases as these, the individual will not need any test or dramatic setback in order to awaken him to spiritual realities of which he is already aware. Indeed, the Baha'i Writings explain that the very purpote of the spiritual education of children and youth is to lead them to such an understanding of spiritual realities that, upon reaching adulthood, they will be naturally equipped to take charge of their own lives and spiritual growth processes. 

 Spiritual education of this quAlity is extremely rare (in fact virtually nonexistent) in our society today, but the Baha Writings contain many principles and techniques for the spiritual education of children and affirm that the application of these principles will, in the future, enable the majority of people to attain the age of adulthood with a clear understanding of the dynamics of the spiritual growth process. Though this state of affairs will not eliminate all human suffering (in particular suffering which comes from physical accidents or certain illnesses), it will eliminate that considerable proportion of human suffering which is generated by the sick, distorted, and destructive response patterns and modes of functioning so widespread in current society. 

 2 The answer may be that our expectations were unreasonable  to begin with. In this way, failure to obtain some particular external goal can lead to success in gaining valid knowledge and insight into our internal processes, thus fostering spiritual growth. Indeed, there is very little that happens to us in life that cannot be used to give us new self-insight and hence contribute to fulfilling the basic purpose of prosecuting the spiritual

  The frequency with which the perception of inadequacy and the consequent motivation to change is born through fiery ordeal has led some to build a model of spiritual growth in which such dramatic failures and terrible sufferings are considered to be unavoidable and necessary aspects of the growth process. The Baha'i Writings would appear to take a middle position on this question. On the one hand, they clearly affirm that tests, difficulties, and sufferings are inevitable, natural concomitants of the spiritual growth process. Such painful experiences, it is explained, serve to give us deeper understanding of certain spiritual laws upon which our continued growth depends.1 On the other hand, many instances of human suffering are simply the result of careless living and are therefore potentially avoidable. Baha are taught to pray to God for preservation from violent or extreme tests. 

Moreover, the Baha'i      

 Writings strictly forbid asceticism and any other similar philosophies or disciplines which incite the individual actively to seek pain or suffering in the path of spiritual growth. The growth process itself involves enough pain without our seeking more through misguided or thoughtless  living. 

 But the deep sufferings and dramatic  setbacks are potentially there for everyone  who feels inclined to learn the hard way.2 

  growth process. It sometimes happens that a person whose spontaneous level of functioning is quite weak and defective is soon led to discover this fact while a person whose spontaneous level of functioning is rather high (due to favourable circumstances in early life or to exceptional natural endowments) persists for many years in his spiritually unaware state, making no spiritual progress whatever. In this way, the person whose spontaneous level of functioning is weak may take charge of his growth process much sooner than others and thereby eventually surpass those with more favourable natural endowments or initial life circumstances. 

 1  Regarding the spiritual meaning and purpose of suffering,  'Abdu'l-Baha has said: 'Tests are benefits from God, for which we should thank Him. Grief and sorrow do not come to us by chance, they are sent to us by the Divine mercy for our own perfecting. The mind and spirit of man advance when he is tried by suffering suffering and tribuladon free man from the petty affairs of this worldly life until he arrives at a state of complete detachment. 

 His attitude in this world will be that of divine happiness. Through suffering (one) will attain to an eternal happiness which nothing can take from him. To attain eternal happiness one must suffer. 

 He who has reached the state of self sacrifice has true joy. Temporal ]oy will vanish.' Divine Art of Living, pp. 89 — 90. 

 2  Naturally, it is heartening to see examples of murderers, thieves, rapists, or drug addicts who turn themselves around and become useful members of society and Of course, even dramatic failures and sufferings may sometimes not be enough to convince  us of our weaknesses and immaturities. We may put up various 'defences,' i.e., we may resist seeing the truth of the matter even when it is plain to everyone but ourselves. 

 We engage in such strategies of self-illusion primarily when, for whatever reason, we find some particular bit of self-revelation unusually hard to take. 

 If we do not learn the lesson from the situation, we may blindly and adamantly persist in the same behaviour or thought patterns which continue to produce new and perhaps even more painful situations. We are then in a 'vicious circle' in which our resistance to accepting the truer picture of reality actually increases with each new bit of negative feedback. 

 Regarding such vicious circle situations, 'Abdu'l-Baha has said: 'Tests are a means by which a soul is measured as to its fitness, and proven out by its own acts. God knows its fitness beforehand,  and also its unpreparedness, but man, with an ego, would not believe himself unfit unless some proof were given to him. Con-seqently  his susceptibility to evil is proven to him when he falls into tests, and the tests are continued until the soul realizes its own unfitness, then remorse and regret tend to root out the weakness.'3 Let us sum up. We start the process of conscious spiritual development by becoming aware of how we function at our present level of maturity. We assess as realistically as possible the level of intellectual, emotional, and behavioural maturity we have attained at present. 

 As we perceive imbalanced development,  underdevelopment, or improper development, we begin the job of correcting the perceived inadequacies. 

 It is at this stage, in particular, that the Baha'i view of the nature of man becomes so important in fostering our spiritual growth and progress.4 

 Suppose we perceive, for occasionally morally and intellectually superior human beings. But one can also deplore the fact that people with such potential and talents must waste so many years and cause so much suffering to themselves and others before realizing their potential. 
Quoted in Daniel Jordan,  

The Meaning of Deepening (Wilmette:

 Baha Publishing Trust, 1973), p. 38. 

 Of course, if our parents and educators have also had the Baha viewpoint of the nature of man, this will have

  example, that we have a tendency to be very wilful, aggressive, and dominant in our relations  with others. From the Baha'i viewpoint,  we would not consider the negative features of this pattern as inherently evil or sinful or as arising from some evil part of ourselves, a part which must be despised and suppressed. We are free to recognize the positive potential of this aspect of our character.  After examination, we might find that we have not sufficiently developed our feeling capacity and are, therefore, sometimes insensitive to the needs and feelings of others. Or perhaps we often act impulsively and need to develop also our understanding capacity so as to act more reflectively and wisely. Or again, we might find that our mode of relating to others represents an attempt to satisfy in an illegitimate way some need within us (a need for security or self-worth perhaps) that we have not succeeded in meeting legitimately. We will then understand that we have been engaging in an improper (and unproductive) use of will and must, therefore, set about redeploying our psychic forces in a more productive manner. 

 As we gradually succeed in doing this, we will satisfy our inner need legitimately and improve our relationships with others at the same time. 

 1 contributed to our development during our formative years. 

 However, our future growth and development will depend on whatever attitudes and viewpoints we persodally maintajo. Nevertheless, we will continue to be significantly affected by our interactions with others and therefore by the attitudes and viewpoints which they have. 

 More will be said about this point in a later section. 

 This hypothetical example serves to stress an important point concerning the Baha'i view of human nature. To say that human nature, in both its material and spiritual aspects, is good means that all of man's natural needs and urges are God-given. 

 Since Baha'is also believe that God's purpose for mankind is positive and beneficial, it follows that there is a legitimate, God-given (and truly satisfactory) way of meeting every natural internal human need (see the quotation in note 6). Such a view contrasts sharply with the idea that some of man's basic urges are intrinsically evil and/or inherently socially (and self) destructive. 

 The Baha'i view of man certainly recognizes that the perversion of a natural capacity or need can lead to virulent social, psychological, moral and spiritual ills, and that dealing with people or groups so afflicted can be extremely difficult. 

 Nevertheless, in effecting a cure even of these terrible spiritual pathologies, it is helpful to realize that the process is based on teaching (and learning) detachment from the false pattern and attachment to the healthy one rather than the purely negative attempt to suppress unacceptable behaviour. 

 In other words, the model of human spiritual  and moral functioning offered by the Baha Faith enables us to respond creatively and constructively once we become aware that change is necessary. 

 We avoid wasting precious energy on guilt, self-hatred, or other such unproductive mechanisms. We are able to produce some degree of change almost immediately. 

 This gives us positive feedback, makes us feel better about ourselves, and helps generate courage to continue the process of change we have just begun. 

 We now come to the important question of the mechanism by which we can take a step forward in the path of spiritual progress. What we need to consider is the hierarchical relationship between knowledge, love, and action. 

  4.  Knowledge, Love, and 

Will                      

 A close examination of the psychology of the spiritual growth process as presented in the Baha Writings indicates that the proper and harmonious functioning of our basic spiritual capacities depends on recognizing a hierarchical  relationship among them. At the apex of this hierarchy is the knowing capacity. 

  'First and foremost among these favors, which the Almighty hat/i conferred upon man, is the gift of understanding. His purpose  in conferring such a gift is none other except to enable His creature to know and recognize the one true God — exalted be His glory. 

 This gift giveth man the power to discern the truth in all things, leadeth him to that which is right, and helpeth him to discover the secrets of creation. Next in rank, is the power of vision, the chief instrument whereby his understanding can function. The senses of hearing, of the heart, and the like, are similarly to be reckoned among the gifts with which the human body is endowed. 

  'These gifts are inherent in man himself That which is preeminent above all other gifts, is incorruptible in nature, and per-taineth to God Himself, is the gift of Divine Revelation. 

 Every bounty conferred by the Creator upon man, be it material or spiritual, is subservient unto this.'2 2 Gleanings, pp. 194 — 195.


<p952>
952                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  In the last chapter of Some Answered Questions, 'Abdu'l-Baha elaborates even further on this theme. 

 He explains that right actions and moral behaviour are not in themselves  sufficient for spirituality. Alone, such actions and behaviour constitute '. a body of the greatest loveliness, but without spirit.'1 He then explains: that which is the cause of everlasting life, eternal honour, universal enlightenment, real salvation and prosperity is, first of all, the knowledge of God.'2 He continues, affirming: 'Second, comes the love of God, the light of which shines in the lamp of the hearts of those who know God.' .~ and 'The third virtue of humanity is the goodwill which is the basis of good actions. 

 though a good action is praiseworthy, yet if it is. not sustained by the knowledge of God, the love of God, and a sincere intention, it is imperfect.'4 In another passage, 'Abdu'l-Baha expresses the primacy of knowledge with respect to action as follows: 'Although a person of good deeds is acceptable at the Threshold of the Almighty, yet it is first "to know" and then "to do". Although a blind man produceth a most wonderful and exquisite art, yet he is deprived of seeing it. By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds.'5 In yet another passage, 'Abdu'l-Baha describes the steps towards the attainment of spirituality: 'By what means can man acquire these things? How shall he obtain these merciful  gifts and powers? 

 First, through the knowledge of God. Second, through the love of God. Third, through faith. Fourth, through philanthropic deeds. Fifth, through self-sacrifice. 

 Sixth, through severance from this world. Seventh, through sanctity and holiness. 

 Unless he acquires these forces and attains to these requirements he will surely be deprived of the life that is eternal.'6 In the above passages, and in many others not quoted, the hierarchical ordering of spiritual faculties is the same: Knowledge leads to love which generates the courage to act (i.e., faith) which forms the basis of the intention to Some Answered Questions, p. 300. 

 2 ibid ibid. ibid., p. 302. 

 Baha'i World of Faith, pp. 382 — 383. 

 6 Divine Art of Living, p. 19. 

 act (i.e., motive and good will) which in turn leads to action itself (i.e., good deeds). Of course, the knowledge which starts this psycho-spiritual chain reaction is not just any kind of knowledge, but the knowledge of God which is equivalent to true self-knowledge. 

 As we begin to take charge of our own spiritual growth process, one of the main problems we Lace is that our existing perception  of ourselves — of what we are and of what we should be — is bound to be distorted and inadequate in various ways, for this self-perception  (or self-image) is the very basis of the spontaneous response pattern we have inherited from our childhood and early youth. Indeed, our mode of functioning at any given stage of our development is largely just a dramatization of our basic self-image; it is the projection of this self-image onto the various life situations we encounter. Thus, our self-image  is, in many ways, the key to our personalities. 

 To say that our self-image is distorted means that it does not correspond to reality, the reality that is within us. Perhaps we have an exaggerated image of ourselves, believing we have talents and abilities we lack in reality. We may, at the same time and in other ways, underestimate ourselves, carrying an unrealistically negative concept of our 

Capacities.               

 In any case, to the degree that our self-concept  is false we will experience unpleasant tensions and difficulties as we become involved  in various life situations. The false or unrealistic parts of our self-image will be implicitly judged by our encounter with external  reality. 

 We will sense this and begin to perceive, at first vaguely and uncomfortably but then more sharply, that something is wrong. Even though this feedback information from external reality may be from neutral sources and devoid of any value-judgemental quality, we may nevertheless perceive it as a threat or even an attack. If the feedback is not neutral but comes, say, in the form of blatantly negative criticism from others, our sense of being threatened will certainly be much greater. 

 Moreover, we will perceive the source of these threats as being somewhere outside ourselves. 

 It will not naturally occur to us that the source lies rather within ourselves in


<p953>
ESSAYS AND REVIEWS           953

  the form of an illusory and unrealistic self concept. 

 Therefore, our instinctive reaction to the negative feedback information will be to resist, to defend our self-image and to strive to maintain it. In defending our self-image, we believe we are defending our selves because we do not view ourselves as a mosaic of true and false, real and unreal. We see only the seamless, undifferentiated whole of 'I' or 'me. The result is that we begin to bind up more and more of our psychic energies in the defence of our self-image. We confuse egotistic  pride, which is our attachment to our limited and distorted self-concept, with self-respect and honour, which are expressions of the deep spiritual truth that we are created in the image of God with an intrinsic value given by Him and without any essentially evil or sinful part. 

 The 'binding energy' involved in our defence  of our self-concept is frequently experienced  as various negative emotions like fear, rage, jealousy, or aggression. 

 These emotions are all expressions of our attempt to locate the source of our irritation outside ourselves in objective, external reality. We are also liable to experience considerable anxiety as we cling more and more desperately  to whatever false part of ourselves we cannot relinquish. 

 Clearly, the greater the pathology of our self-image and the greater our attachment to it, the stronger will be our sense of being threatened and attacked, and the greater will be the amount of psychic energy necessary to maintain and defend the false part of our self-image. 

 At this point, an increase in self knowledge will be represented by some insight into ourselves which enables us to discard a false part of our self-image. 

 This act of self-knowledge is the first stage of the mechanism involved in taking a single step forward in the process of spiritual growth. Such an increment in self-knowledge has one immediate consequence: It instantly releases that part of our psychic energy which was previously bound up in defending and maintaining the false self-concept.  The release of this binding energy is most usually experienced as an extremely positive emotion, a sense of exhilaration and of liberation. It is love. We have a truer picture of our real (and therefore God-created) selves, and we have a new reservoir of energy which is now freed for its God-intended use in the form of service to others. 

 Following this release of energy will be an increase in courage. We have more courage partly because we have more knowledge of reality and have therefore succeeded in reducing, however slightly, the vastness of what is unknown and hence potentially threatening to us. We also have more courage because we have more energy to deal with whatever unforeseen difficulties may lie ahead. This new increment of courage is an increase in faith. 

 Courage generates within us intentionality, i.e., the willingness and the desire to act. We want to act because we are anxious to experience the sense of increased mastery that will come from dealing with life situations which previously appeared difficult or impossible  but which now seem challenging and interesting. And we are also eager to seek new challenges, to use our new knowledge and energy in circumstances we would have previously  avoided. 

 And, most importantly, we have an intense desire to share with others, to serve them and to be an instrument, to whatever possible extent, in the process of their spiritual growth and development. 

 Finally, this intentionality, this new motivation, expresses itself in concrete action. Until now everything has taken place internally, in the inner recesses of our psyche. No external observer could possibly know that anything significant has taken place. But when we began to act, the reality of this inner process is dramatized. Action, then, is the dramatization of intentionality and therefore of knowledge, faith, and love. It is the visible, observable concomitant of the invisible process  that has occurred within us. We have taken a step forward in our spiritual development. 

 We have moved from one level to another. However small the step may be, however minimal the difference between the old level of functioning and the new, a definite transition has taken place. 

 Whenever we act, we affect not only ourselves but also our physical and social environment. Our action thereby evokes a reaction from others. 

 This reaction is, of course, just a form of the feedback information  mentioned above. But the difference is that our action has now been the result of a


<p954>
954                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  conscious and deliberate process. We know why we acted the way we did. Thus, we will perceive the reaction in a different way, even if it is negative (our good intentions certainly do not guarantee that the reaction will be positive). We will welcome the reaction because  it will help us evaluate our actions. 

 In short, the reaction to our actions will give us new knowledge, new self-insight. In this way, the cycle starts again and the process of taking another step along the path of spiritual growth is repeated. We represent this by the following diagram: 

       KNOWLEDGE                
REACTION   LOVE          
I                        

ACTION                   
                         
     INTENTIONALITY           

 As is the case with any new discipline, so it is with learning spiritual growth. Our first steps forward are painfully self-cohscious and hesitant. We are acutely aware of each detail, so much so that we wonder whether we will ever be able to make it work. We are elated at our first successes, but we tend to linget on the plateaus, becoming sufficiently motivated to take another step only when negative pressures  begin to build up intolerably, forcing us to act. 

 Yet, as we pursue the process, we becomd more adept at it. Gradually, certain aspects become spontaneous and natural (not unconscious). 

 They become part of us to the point of being reflex actions. The feedback loop resulting from our actions becomes more and more automatic. 

 The rate of progress begins to pick up. The steps merge imperceptibly. 

 Finally, the process becomes almost continuous. 

 In other words, the rate of progress increases as we go along because we are not only making progress but also perfecting our skill at making progress. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha has said: 'It is possible to so ad]ust one's self to the practice of nobility that its atmosphere surrounds  and colours every act. When actions are habitually and conscientiously adjusted to noble standards, with no thought of the words that might herald them, then nobility becomes the accent of life. 

 At such a degree of evolution one scarcely needs try any longer to be good — all acts are become the distinctive expression of nobility.'1 A process in which the rate of progress is proportional,to the amount of progress made is exponential (see note 52). Thus, an analysis of the mechanism of the spiritual growth process allows us to understand why this process, though remaining a gradual one, is exponential: It is because we perfect the process of growing spiritually as we grow, thereby increasing the rate at which growth occurs. 

 The above diagram, and the detailed analysis of each stage of the mechanism involved in the hierarchical relationship between knowledge, ledge, love, and will, should not lead us to FAH~ H forget the other fundamental point, namely that all of our spiritual faculties must function together at each stage of the mechanism. In order to gain self-insight, we must will to know the truth about ourselves, and we must be attracted towards the truth. 

 When we act, we must temper our actions with the knowledge and wisdom we have already accumulated at that given point in our development. 

 Moreover, when we begin the process of conscious, self-directed spiritual growth, we do not start from absolute emptiness but rather from the basis of whatever knowledge, love, faith, and will we have developed at that point in our lives. Thus, the spiritual growth process is lived and dramatized by each individual in a way which is unique to him even though the basic mechanism of progress and the rules which govern it are universal. 
                         
5.          Tools for Spiritual
Growth                   

 Our understanding of the process of spiritual growth and its dynamics does not guarantee that we will be successful in our pursuit of spirituality. 

 We stand in need of practical tools to help us at every turn. The Baha'i Writings give a clear indication of a number of such tools. In particular, prayer, meditation on and study of the Writings of the Manifestations, and active service to mankind are repeatedly mentioned. For example, in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi it is stated: 'When a person becomes a Baha, actually  what takes place is that the seed of the 'Abdu'l-Baha, Star of the West, Vol. 17, p. 286.


<p955>
ESSAYS AND REVIEWS           955

  spirit starts to grow in the human soul. This seed must be watered by the outpourings of the Holy Spirit. These gifts of the spirit are received through prayer, meditation, study of the Holy Utterances and service to the Cause of God service in the Cause is like the plough which ploughs the physical soil when seeds are sown.'1 Some of the points mentioned briefly in the above passage are amplified in the following statement from the same source: 'How to attain spirituality is indeed a question to which every young man and woman must sobner or later try to find a satisfactory answer. 

 'Indeed the chief reason for the evils now rampant in society is the lack of spirituality. The materialistic civilization of our age has so much absorbed the energy and interest of mankind that people in general do no longer feel the necessity of raising themselves  above the forces and conditions of their daily material existence. There is not sufficient demand for things that we call spiritual to differentiate them from the needs and requirements of our physical existence. 

 'The universal crisis affecting mankind is, therefore, essentially spiritual in its causes the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites Man with God. This state of spiritual communion can be brought about and maintained by means of meditation  and prayer. 

 And this is the reason why Baha'u'llah has so much stressed the importance of worship. The Baha Faith, like all other Divine Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. 

 Its chief goal is the development of the individual and society, through the acquisition of spiritual virtues and powers. It is the soul of man which has first to be fed. 

 And this spiritual nourishment prayer can best provide.'2 With regard to meditation, the Baha'i Writings explain that it has no set form and that each individual is free to meditate in the Excerpt from a letter written on behalf of

manner he finds most helpful.

 Statements by 'Abdu'l-Baha describe meditation as a silent contemplation, a sustained mental concentration or focusing of thought: 'Baha'u'llah says there is a sign (from God) in every phenomenon: the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign of contemplation is silence, because it is impossible for a man to do two things at one time — he cannot both speak and meditate. 

 'Meditation is the key for opening the doors of mysteries. In that state man abstracts  himself: in that state man withdraws himself from all outside objects; in that subjective mood he is immersed in the ocean of spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of things-in-themselves.'3 'Abdu'l-Baha leaves no doubt concerning the importance of meditation as a tool for spiritual growth: 'You cannot apply the name 'man' to any being void of this faculty of meditation; without it he would be a mere animal, lower than the beasts. 

 'Through the faculty of meditation man attains to eternal life; through it he receives the breath of the Holy Spirit — the bestowal of the Spirit is given in reflection Qnd meditation. 

 And Baha'u'llah has said that 'One hour's reflection is preferable to seventy years of pious worship.'5 The Baha'i Writings suggest that the words and teachings of the Manifestations provide a helpful focus for meditation. Also, while giving considerable freedom to the individual concerning prayer, they likewise suggest that the prayers of the Manifestations are especially  useful in establishing a spiritual connection  between the soul of man and the Divine Spirit. Prayer is defined as conversation  or communion with God: 'The wisdom of prayer is this, that it causes a connection between the servant and the True One, because in that state of prayer man with all his heart and soul turns his face

  towards His Highness the 

Almighty, seeking His     

 association and desiring His love and compassion. 

 The greatest happiness for a lover is to converse with his beloved, and the greatest gift for a seeker is to become familiar with the object of his longing. That is why the greatest hope of every soul who is attracted to the kingdom of God is to find an opportunity to entreat and supplicate at the ocean of His utterance, goodness and generosity.'1 'Abdu'l-Baha has elsewhere explained that the spirit in which one prays is the most important dimension of prayer. A ritualistic mumbling of words or a mindless repetition of syllables is not prayer. Moreover, the Baha'i Writings enjoin the spiritual seeker to make of his whole life, including his professional activities, an act of worship: 'In the Baha'i Cause arts, sciences and all crafts are counted as worship. 

 The man who makes apiece of notepaper to the best of his ability, conscientiously, concentrating all his forces on perfecting it, is giving praise to God. 

 Briefly, all effort put forth by man from the fullness of his heart is worship, if it is prompted by the highest motives and the will to do service to humanity. This is worship: to serve mankind and to minister to the needs of the people. Service is prayer.' 

 2 Thus, it is the spirit and motive of service to others which makes external activity a tool for spiritual progress. 

 In order to pursue the goal of spirituality, one must therefore maintain a persistently high level of motivation. Prayer, meditation, and study of the Words of the Manifestations are essential in this regard: 'The first thing to do is to acquire a thirst for spirituality, then Live the Life! Live the Life! 

 Live the Life! The way to acquire this thirst is to meditate upon the future life. Study the Holy Words, read your Bible, read the Holy Books, especially study the Holy 

Utterances of Baha'u'llah.

 Prayer and Meditation, take much time for these two. Then will you know the Great Thirst, and then only can you begin to 

Live the Life!'3

 Thus, while the quality and maturity of one's relationship to others remain the best measure of spiritual progress and growth, acquiring the capacity for such mature relationships depends essentially on an intense inner life and self-development. 

 Moreover, the individual's actions are experienced both by himself and by others, whereas inner life is experienced only by the individual and is thereby more properly 'his.' The sense of 'that mystic feeling which unites Man with God' becomes to the spiritual seeker the most precious of experiences. 

 It is that part of spirituality which lies at the centre of his heart and soul. 

 In this inner dimension, spirituality becomes a sort of dialogue between the human soul and the Divine Spirit as channelled through the Manifestation. It is within this subjective but nevertheless real dimension of inner spirituality that one finds all the passion, the exaltation of spirit, as well as the terrible but somehow precious moments of despair, of utter helplessness and defeat, of shame and repentance. It is here that one learns with the deeply certain knowledge only personal experience can bestow, that the ultimate category of existence, the absolute and transcendent God who guides and oversees our destiny, is an infinitely loving and merciful Being.

  1.  The Social Matrix of 

Individual Growth         

 Until now in our discussion, we have viewed the process of spiritual growth as being primarily  an individual one, a process which effects changes within the individual and in his behaviour towards his social and natural environment. 

 However, it is obvious that individual spiritual growth does not and cannot take place in a vacuum. 

 It takes place within the context of a given society that is bound to have a profound influence on the individual in his pursuit of spirituality. 

 Indeed,  there are many intricate, subtle, and complex interactions between any society and each of the individuals composing it. These interactions produce reciprocal influences that operate on different levels of behaviour, life experience, and consciousness. 
It is therefore


<p957>
ESSAYS AND REVIEWS            957

  more accurate to view the spiritual growth process as an organically social one having several identifiable but related components. Some of these are: (1) an individual component, which has been the main focus of our discussion in the previous sections, (2) a collective or global component, involving the evolution of society as a whole, and (3) an interactive component, involving the relationship  between the individual and society. 

 In this section, the global and interactive dimensions of the spiritual growth process will be briefly examined. 

 The Baha'i Writings make clear that, just as the individual has a basically spiritual purpose to his existence, so society also has a spiritual raison d'6tre. The spiritual purpose of society is to provide the optimal milieu for the full and adequate spiritual growth and development  of the individuals in that society. 

 In the Baha'i view, all other aspects of social evolution, such as technological innovations, institutional structures, decision-making procedures  and the exercise of authority, group interactions, and the like, are to be judged positive or negative according to whether they contribute to or detract from the goal of fostering a favourable milieu for spiritual growth. 

 Such a concept of society and its meaning is certainly a radical departure from the commonly held view that society serves primarily as a vehicle for economic activity to provide for the conditions of material existence. 

 However, the inherent limitations of this common viewpoint become readily apparent when one reflects that nature itself already provides the basic conditions for material existence. 

 Therefore, providing such conditions can hardly be the fundamental purpose of human society, for society then becomes redundant at best and possibly harmful. 

 Of course, economic activity is an important  part of society's function since a certain level of material wellbeing and stability provides opportunities for spiritual growth. A social milieu in which large segments of the population are starving or living in other such extreme conditions is hardly a milieu which is favourable to the full and adequate spiritual development of its members, although spiritual  growth can take place under such conditions. 

 ditions. Also, a just, well-organized, and efficient economy can serve to free man, at least partially, from boring and excessive labour and thus provide time for higher intellectual and artistic pursuits. 

 Another spiritual implication of economic activity is that it requires intense human interaction and therefore provides many of the challenges and opportunities necessary to stimulate spiritual growth among its participants. 

 It is in the market place that questions of justice, compassion, honesty, trust, and self-sacrifice become living reality and not just abstract philosophy. 

 We therefore  cannot safely neglect the 'outer' dimension of society in the name of our basic preoccupation with spiritual growth. 

 Indeed if the prevailing structures and behavioural norms of society are such as to inhibit or discourage spiritual growth, the individual will be impeded in his personal growth process. The occasional moral hero will succeed in spiritualizing his life against all odds, but the vast majority will eventually succumb to the prevailing negative influences. 

 Also, one of the important characteristics of personal spiritual maturity is a highly developed  social conscience. The spiritually-minded individual has become intensely aware of the many ways he depends on society and has a keen sense of social obligation. 

 Society thus benefits from the spiritualized individuals within its fold because of the unselfish quality of their service to the collectivity, and because their particular talents and capacities are relatively well-developed. 

 At the same time, the individual spiritual seeker's relative dependence on society fosters his humility, and the energy and effort he contributes towards the solution of social problems helps prevent the (necessary) attention he gives to his inner spiritual struggles from leading to an unhealthy degree of self-preoccupation. 

 Baha'u'llah has said that the individual in the pursuit of spirituality should be anxiously concerned with the needs of the society in which he lives and that 'All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization.'1

  individual spiritual growth, we have seen that certain attitudes and behaviour patterns are conducive to spiritual growth whereas others are not. In the same way, certain social norms and types of social structures are conducive to the spiritual growth process whereas others are not. One of the fundamental  features of the Baha'i Faith is that its teachings include detailed prescriptions regarding social structures and their relationship  to spiritual growth. Broadly speaking, Baha'u'llah teaches that those social and economic structures which favour cooperation and unity are conducive to the spiritual growth process while those structures based on competition, conffict, power-seeking, and dominance-seeking hierarchies are destructive to the growth process. The unity taught by Baha'u'llah is not simply a formal juxtaposition  of disparate parts, but an organic unity based on a spiritual quality of relationship between groups and among individuals working within a given group. Nor is it a uniformity or homogeneity, but a 'unity in diversity,' a unity in which the particular qualities of the cooperating components are respected in a way that enables these qualities to contribute to the unity of the whqle rather than detracting from it as so often happens in the case of social structures based on competition and dominance-seeking. 

 The Baha'i focus on unity, and the attention which the Baha Writings give to the social and collective dimension of the spiritual growth process probably represent the most original contributions of the Baha'i Faith to the collective spiritual consciousness of mankind, for the individual dimension of the spiritual growth process has been a part of every reveakd religion. 

 Indeed, some revelations, for example those of Jesus and Buddha, have focused almost entirely on the individual. Other revelations, such as those of Moses and Muhammad, have treated the social dimension to a greater degree, giving laws governing the behaviour of groups as well as that of individuals. 

 However, in the case of the Baha'i Faith, we see for perhaps the first time in religious history the spiritual growth process  in its full collective dimension.

Order                     

 In the Baha view, the whole of mankind constitutes an organic unit which has undergone a collective growth process similar to that of the individual. Just as the individual achieves his maturity in stages, gradually developing his abilities and enlarging the scope of his knowledge and understanding, so mankind has passed through different stages in the as yet unfinished process of achieving its collective maturity. 

 According to Baha'u'llah, each occurrence of revelation has enabled mankind to achieve some particular step forward in its growth process. Of course, every revelation has contributed in a general way to mankind's spiritual awareness by restating and elaborating those eternal spiritual  truths which are the very basis of human existence. But Baha'u'llah affirms that, besides  this general and universal function common  to all revelations, there is a specific function by which each revelation plays its particular and unique role in the total growth process. Here are some of the ways that these two dimensions of revelation are described in the Baha'i Writings: 'The divine religions embody two kinds of ordinances. 

 First those which constitute essential or spiritual teachings of the Word of God. These are faith in God, the acquirement  of the virtues which characterize perfect manhood, praiseworthy moralities, the acquisition of the bestowals and bounties emanating from the divine effulgences; in brief the ordinances which concern the realm of morals and ethics. This is the fundamental aspect of the religion of God and this is of the highest importance because knowledge of God is the fundamental requirement of man. This is the essential foundation of all the divine religions, the reality itself, common to all. 

 'Secondly: Laws and ordinances which are temporary and nonessential. These concern human transactions and relations. They are accidental and subject to change according to the exigencies of time and place.'1 'God's purpose in sending His Prophets unto men is twofold. The first is to liberate the children of men from the darkness of ignorance, and guide them to the light of true understanding. The second is to ensure the

  peace and tranquillity of mankind, and provide all the means by which they can be established.'1 'These Manifestations of God have each a twofold station. 

 One is the station of pure abstraction and essential unity If thou wilt observe with discriminating eyes, thou wilt behold Them all abiding in the same tabernacle, soaring in the, same heaven, seated upon the same throne, uttering the same speech, and proclaiming the same Faith.. 

 The other station is the station of distinction, and pertaineth to the world of creation, and to the limitations thereof. In this respect, each Manifestation of God hat/i a distinct individuality, a definitely prescribed mission, a predestined revelation, and specially designated limitations. Each one of them is known by a different name, is characterized by a special attribute, fulfils a definite mission, and is entrusted with a particular Revelation.'2 

     Baha'u'llah associates His      

 'particular revelation' with the transition from adolescence to adulthood in the collective life of mankind. He affirms that the social history of mankind from its primitive beginnings in the formation of small social groups until the present day represents the stages of the infancy, childhood, and adolescence of mankind. 

 Mankind now stands poised on the brink of maturity, and the current turbulence and strife in the world are analogous to the turbulence of the ultimate stages of preaduithood in the life of the individual. 

  'The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which the human race had to pass, have receded into the background. 

 Humanity  is now experiencing the commotions invariably associated with the most turbulent  stage of its evolution, the stage of adolescence, when the impetuosity of youth and its vehemence reach their climax, and must gradually be superseded by the calmness, the wisdom, and the maturity that characterize the stage of manhood.'3 Gleanings, pp. 79 — 80.

 959 'The principle of the Oneness of Mankind — the pivot round which all the teachings of Baha'u'llah revolve — is no mere outburst of ignorant emotionalism or an expression of vague and pious hope. Its message is applicable not oniy to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of those essential relationships that must bind all the states and nations as members of one human family. 

 It implies an organic change in the structure of presentday society, a change such as the world has not yet experienced. 

 'It represents the consummation of human  evolution — an evolution that has had its earliest beginnings in the birth of family life, its subsequent development in the achievement of tribal solidarity, leading in turn to the constitution of the city-state, and expanding later into the institution of independent and sovereign nations. 

 'The principle of the Oneness of Mankind,  as proclaimed by Baha'u'llah, carries with it no more and no less than a solemn assertion that attainment to this final stage in this stupendous evolution is not oniy necessary but inevitable, that its realization is fast approaching, and that nothing short of a power that is born of God can succeed in establishing it.'4 Because Baha'u'llah conceived His fundamental  mission to be that of realizing world unity, His teachings contain detailed proposals for the establishment of institutions and social forms conducive to that end. For example, He proposes the establishment of a world legislature and a world court having final jurisdiction in all disputes between nations. He proposes the adoption of a universal auxiliary language, of universal  obligatory education, of the principle of equality of the sexes, and of an economic system which would eliminate the extremes of poverty and wealth. 

 All of these institutions and principles He sees as essential to building a society that encourages and promotes the full spiritual growth of its members.

  culture — all of which must synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the Golden Age of the Baha'i Era — should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the furthermost  limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an individual, will, nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation, continue indefinitely to progress  and develop.'1 Baha'u'llah gave the term 'world order' to the new system He envisaged. 

 Baha believe that the establishment of this new world order is ultimately the only answer to the quest for spiritual growth. 

 For if the stability, harmony, and morally progressive character of human society are not assured, the individual's goal of achieving spiritual development will be frustrated and his basic purpose in life thereby undermined. 

 The change in focus which results from this global perspective on the spiritual growth process is succinctly and clearly expressed by Shoghi Effendi: the object of life to a Baha'i is to promote the oneness of mankind. 

 The whole object of our lives is bound up with the lives of all human beings; not a personal salvation we are seeking, but a universal one. Our aim is to produce a world civilization which will in turn react on the character of the individual. It is, in a way, the inverse of Christianity which started with the individual unit and through it reached out to the conglomerate life of men.'2 

4.  The Bab~'i Community  

 The social structures and behavioural norms of presentday society are largely those we have inherited from the past. 

 For the most part, they have not been consciously chosen by the collectivity through some deliberate process, but rather have evolved in response to various temporary and sometimes contradictory  exigencies. 

 They most certainly have not been chosen according to the criterion of fostering spiritual growth. 
'ibid., p. 163.           

  2  Shoghi Effendi, quoted in The Spiritual Revolution (Thornhill, 

Ontario: Canadian Baha'i  
Community, 1974), p. 9.   

 Especially in the industrialized West, but even in more technologically primitive societies,  the currently existing social forms are largely based on competition and on dominance-seeking hierarchies. Such social forms tend to promote disunity, conflict, aggressive behaviour, power-seeking behaviour, and excessive preoccupation with purely material success. The following passage from the Writings of Baha'u'llah powerfully conveys the destructive effects mankind has suffered as a result of these social forms and behaviour patterns: 'And amongst the realms of unity is the unity of rank and station. 

 It kdoundeth to the exaltation of the Cause, glorifying it among all peoples. 

 Ever since the seeking of preference and distinction came into play, the world bath been laid waste. 
it hat/i become desolate. 

 Those who have quaffed from the ocean of divine utterance and fixed their gaze upon the Realm of Glory should regard themselves as being on the same level as the others and in the same station. Were this matter to be definitely established and conclusively demonstrated through the power and might of God, the world would become as the Abhd 

Paradise.                 

 'Indeed, man is noble, inasmuch as each one is a repository of the sign of God. Nevertheless, to regard oneself as superior in knowledge, learning or virtue, or to exalt oneself or seek preference, is a grievous transgression. 

 Great is the blessedness of those who are adorned with the ornament of this unity and have been graciously confirmed by God.'3 Given Baha'u'llah's affirmation that unity is the necessary social basis for spiritual growth, it follows that we are now living in a society which is Largely indifferent and in many ways detrimental to the spiritual growth process. Indeed, the historical events of the twentieth century and the moral quality of our day to day lives provide powerful confirmations of this hypothesis. The social structures of presentday society are vestiges of past forms which may have been helpful in stimulating certain kinds of growth during previous stages Quoted in a letter from the Universal House of

  of mankind's spiritual evolution but which have now outlived their usefulness. 

 This situation obviously poses a deep prob-1cm to any individual who is serious in his pursuit of spiritual growth. 

 Even if one accepts Baha'u'llah's model of world order and is willing to strive to bring it about as the best hope for mankind, how is one to pursue successfully the spiritual growth process in a milieu that is so unconcerned with it? 

 The answer the Baha'i Faith offers to this dilemma is the Baha'i community. 

 Baha'u'llah has not only offered a vision and a hope for the future, He has established a living community  which already functions on the basis of the unity principles. This community is conceived as a prototype or an embryo of the future world society. By relating properly to this community and participating in it, the individual finds himself capable of developing his spiritual capacities in a significant way, even if the enveloping society-at-Large remains indifferent to the growth process. Baha'is view the Baha community established  by Baha'u'llah as a precious and necessary tool for this transition period from the old to the new social order. 

 At the same time, the growth and development of the Baha'i community  are part of the progressive establishment  of the world order itself. 

Moreover, the Baha'i      

 community functions as an entity and as a constructive force within the larger community to stimulate the movement of society as a whole towards unity. 

 The individual's participation in the Baha'i community is not passive. There is no priest-hopd,  clergy, or ecclesiastical hierarchy in the Baha'i Faith. 

 Spiritual growth is a self initiated, self-responsible process, and the individual's participation in the Baha'i community  in no way diminishes his responsibility for his personal development. 

 In order to understand more clearly how participation in the Baha'i community fosters spiritual development, let us focus for a moment on the spiritually negative features of modern-day society. It is in the contrast between the Baha'i community, based on unity and cooperation, and the larger society based on competition and dominance-seeking, that we can gain insight into the interactive dimension  of the spiritual growth process. 

 It is the essence of the relationship between an individual alid the society to which he belongs that the individual is strongly motivated to succeed according to the prevailing norms of success in the given society. Security,  status, material wellbeing, social acceptance,  and approval are the main things the individual seeks from society, and success in satisfying societal norms yields these rewards. Society wants the individual's productive effort,  his collaboration and support in the realization of collective goals. Society applies both incentives and threats to induce the individual to accept social norms and goals. 

 To say that an individual accepts the norms and goals of a society means that he uses his understanding capacity to learn the skills necessary for success. He must also cultivate those emotional patterns, attitudes, and aspirations  which characterize socially successful individuals in the given society. 

 Finally, he must act in a way conducive to success. Such a pattern of behaviour will involve producing certain goods or services as well as a certain kind of relationship with other members of the society. 

 The norms of modern industrialized society largely revolve around material success through competition, dominance-seeking and power-seeking.  The goal is usually a high level of economic productivity coupled with a high ranking and status in the social hierarchy. To succeed, the individual must learn those skills and techniques which enable him to best others in competitive struggle and to obtain power over them. He must learn how to manipulate, control, and dominate others. The knowledge which is useful to these ends is often diametrically opposed to the kind of knowledge involved in spiritual growth. We have earlier seen that the self-knowledge which is equivalent to the knowledge• of God amounts to knowing how to submit to the will of God: The individual must learn how to be the conscious instrument of a force that is his moral and spiritual superior. 

 Thus, virtually all the skills he develops in the pursuit of social success in a power-oriented society will be useless and, in fact, detrimental to his spiritual growth. 

 The spiritually sensitive individual  in modern society is therefore faced with a dilemma. 

 He will either become a split personality, trying to be spiritual part of the time and to manipulate others for the


<p962>
962                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  remainder, or else he will ultimately have to choose between the two goals of social success and spiritual progress. 1 It is not only the development of the knowing capacity that is falsified by the pursuit of success in competition, but the heart's feeling capacity as well. One must continually give priority to one's own needs and desires and become increasingly insensitive to the needs of others. 

 Genuine compassion towards and love for other individuals undermines the will to dominate because such empathetic emotions lead one to identify with and to experience the feelings of the dominated other. 

 The giving and receiving of love is a reciprocal or symmetric relationship. 

 It is a positive and satisfying experience for both parties. 

 Dominance, however, is asymmetrical,  yielding positive emotions and a sense of exhilaration for the dominant one, but generally negative, depressed, angry and self deprecating emotions for the one dominated. It is therefore logically and psychologically impossible to seek to dominate someone whom we genuinely love, since the empathetic emotions of love allow us to feel the unpleasant  emotions of being dominated, and this experience undermines our willingness to become the conscious agent of producing such negative emotions in one we love and respect. 

 In other words, we cannot be successful in competitive struggle with others without hurting  them, and we cannot deliberately hurt others if we love them. It is thus easy to see how a person who dedicates himself to success in competitive struggle with others will increasingly  become alienated both from himself and from others. His heart will become atrophied and hard. The development of his feeling capacity will be stunted and distorted. 

 The will capacity is also misused in the pursuit of power and dominance. 

 The force of the will is turned outward towards others and used against them rather than being turned inward towards self-mastery and self-dominance.  The will is used to oppose others, 1 Success in the pursuit of dominance must be distinguished from success in the pursuit of excellence. 

 Striving for excellence is highly encouraged in the Baha Writings. 

 That the two pursuits are different, and that competitive struggle with others is not necessary to attain excellence, are important spiritual and psychological insights. 

 to limit their field of action, rather than being applied to develop the internal capacities of the self in the pursuit of spirituality and excellence. 

 Excellence represents self-development, the flowering of the self's capacities and qualities. It involves comparisons between our performance  at different instances and under various circumstances (so-called 'self-competition'). But competition and power-seeking are based on comparisons with the performance of others. Such comparisons usually lead either to mediocrity, arrogance, undeveloped potential and unrealistically 1ow~ self-expectations or else to depression, jealousy, aggressive behaviour and unrealistically high self-expec-tations,  depending on the capacities of those with whom we choose to compare ourselves. Neither of these is conducive to excellence. 

 In pursuing power, we tend to manipulate others, to use them as means to our ends. This is the very opposite of serving others and of acting towards them in such a way as to contribute to their spiritual advancement —  the proper, God-intended expression of the will in action. In fact, unselfish service to society and true sdf-development go hand-in-hand,  for a high degree of development makes us secure in our identity. It gives us inner peace and self confidence. 

 Moreover, we have more to give others, and our service is therefore more valuable and more effective. 

 Thus, spirituality and the pursuit of excellence reinforce each other while power struggle and competition are inimical to both. The pursuit of dominance may stimulate some development on the part of the 'winners,' but such development is often at the expense of others and of society as a whole. And even for the winners, it frequently produces an unstable, artificial, and imbalanced kind of development. 

 A society based on unity, cooperation and mutual encouragement allows everyone to pursue spirituality and excellence while contributing  significantly to the society itself. 

 Just as love is satisfactory to both giver and receiver, so unity is beneficial both to society and to the individual members of the society. Such is the interactive dimension of the spiritual growth process. 

 Unity, cooperation, and mutuality constitute the norms and goals of the Baha'i corn

  munity and form the basis of its institutions. Therefore, all the spiritual benefits which derive from a society based on unity principles accrue to those who participate in the Baha'i community. 

 There is, first of all, the association  with other people who are also committed  to the process of self-aware, self-initiated  spiritual growth. Since no two people have exactly the same experiences or have attained an identical level of develJpment in all areas of their lives, the individual participant  receives much stimulation and help from others. When facing a spiritual crisis in his personal life, he can usually find those who have already faced a similar crisis and can give helpful advice and loving encouragement. 

 He therefore overcomes many difficulties which, under other circumstances, might have discouraged him to such an extent that he would have abandoned the struggle for spiritual growth. 

 He consequently attains a much higher level of development than would have been the case had he been deprived of such helpful associations and fellowship. 

 At the same time, the mutuality and reciprocal nature of association based on unity means that the relationship with the community  is not unidirectional: The individual is not a passive recipient of spiritual advice from experts, but has opportunities to contribute to the growth of others and of the community. His own qualities, experiences, and opinions are respected and valued by others. 

 He is constantly being called upon to sacrifice purely selfish interests in the path of service. This acts as a check on pride and arrogance. Since sincerely motivated service to others is the real fruit of the spiritual growth process, the individual is provided almost daily with concrete situations which enable him better to evaluate the level of spiritual development he has attained. 

 The spiritual seeker in contemplative isolation can easily fall victim to the subtle pitfall of spiritual pride. Preoccupied with his perception of his internal mental processes, he can quickly acquire the self-generated illusion that he has reached a high degree of spiritual development. 

 Constant and vigorous participation  in a hardworking community can help to dispel such conceits. 

 Participation in the Baha'i community enables one to acquire certain specific skills that cannot be easily acquired elsewhere. For example, the basis of group decision-making in the Baha'i Faith is consultation, a process involving a frank but loving expression of views by those involved on a basis of absolute equality. 

 Consultation represents a subtle and multifaceted spiritual process, and time and effort are required to perfect it. Similarly, the electoral processes in the Baha'i community involve many unique aspects which will not be discussed in the framework of this paper. 

 Another important dimension of the Baha community is its diversity and universality. One is called upon to associate intimately with people of all social, cultural, and racial backgrounds. 

 In society at large, our associations  tend to be based on homogeneity: We associate with people with whom we feel the most comfortable. If most of our associations are on this basis, it will be difficult for us to discover our subtle prejudices and illusory self-concepts. 

 Our friends will be those who are congruent with the false as well as the true aspects of our personality. The immense diversity within the Baha'i community makes the discovery of prejudice and self-deceit much easier. 

    Thus, the Baha'i Faith     

 views the spiritual growth process as both collective and individual.  The collective dimension involves the principles by which human society can be properly structured and ordered so as to optimize spiritual and material wellbeing and to provide a healthy growth milieu for all individuals within it. The individual bears the primary responsibility for prosecuting his own growth process and for working to create a unified and healthy social milieu for everyone. This involves working towards the establishment  of world unity. In particular, it involves active participation in the ongoing life of the Baha'i community which, though forming only a part of society as a whole, already functions on the basis of the unity principles and seeks to implement them progressively in society. 
                          
IV. Summary and Conclusion

 In the Baha'i conception, spirituality is the process of the full, adequate, proper, and harmonious development of the spiritual capacities  of each human being and of the


<p964>
964                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  collectivity of human beings. These spiritual capacities are capacities of a nonphysical, indivisible and eternally lasting entity called the soul. 

 The soul of each individual, with its particular characteristics, is formed at the moment of the conception of the physical body. The process of spiritual development is eternal, continuing in other dimensions of existence after the death of the physical body. The body and its physical capacities serve as instruments for this process of spiritual growth during the period of earthly life when the body and soul are linked together. 

 All of man's initially given capacities, both physical and spiritual, are good and potentially  helpful to the spiritual growth process. However, there is a certain tension between the body's physical needs and the metaphysical needs of the soul. Physical needs and desires must therefore be disciplined (not suppressed) if they are to contribute to the process of spiritual development in an effective way. Through the misuse or improper development of his initially given capacities, man can acquire unnatural or inordinate capacities and needs inimical to the spiritual growth process. 

 Among the basic spiritual capacities to be developed are the understanding or knowing capacity, the heart or feeling capacity, and the will, which represents the capacity to initiate and sustain action. The beginning stage of the process of spiritual development in childhood is one in which the individual is primarily the passive recipient of an educational process initiated by others. 

 As the individual attains the full development of his physical capacities in adolescence, he becomes the active and self-responsible agent of his own growth process. 

 The goal of the development of the knowing  capacity is the attainment of truth, which means that which is in conformity with reality. The ultimate reality to be known is God, and the highest form of knowledge is the knowledge of Him. God is the self-aware and intelligent force (Creator) responsible for man and his development. 

 This knowledge of God takes the form of a particukr kind of self-knowledge which enables the individual to become a conscious, willing, and intelligent instrument for God and for his purposes. 

 The goal of the development of the heart capacity is love. Love represents the energy necessary to pursue the goal of spiritual development. 

 It is experienced as a strong attraction for and attachment to God and the laws and principles He has established. It also expresses itself as an attraction to others and in particular to the spiritual potential they have as beings like ourselves. 

 Love thereby creates within us the desire to become instruments  for the growth process of others. 

 The goal of the development of the will capacity is service to God, to others, and to ourselves. Service is realized by a certain kind of intentionality (good will) which is dramatized  through appropriate action (good works). All of these basic capacities must be developed  systematically and concomitantly, or else false or improper development (unspiri-tuality)  will result. 

 Our condition during the period of earthly life is one in which we have direct access to material reality but only indirect access to spiritual reality. 

 The proper relationship to God is therefore established by means of recognizing and accepting the Manifestations or prophetic figures Who are superhuman beings sent by God for the purpose of educating  and instructing mankind. These Manifestations are the link between the visible world of material reality and the invisible, but ultimately more real, world of spiritual reality. Acceptance of the Manifestations and obedience  to the laws They reveal are seen to constitute an essential prerequisite for the successful prosecution of the spiritual growth process. 

 The human race constitutes an organic unit whose fundamental component is the individual.  Mankind undergoes a collective spiritual evolution analogous to the individual's own growth process. The periodic appearance of a Manifestation of God is the motive force of this process of social evolution. 

 Human society is currently at the stage of the critical transition from adolescence to adulthood  or maturity. 

 The practical expression of this yet-to-be-achieved maturity is a unified world society based on a world government, the elimination of prejudice and war, and the establishment of justice and harmony among the nations and peoples of the world. The particular mission of the revelation of Baha'u'llah is to provide the basis for this new


<p965>
ESSAYS AND REVIEWS           965

  world order and the moral impetus to effect this transition in the collective life of mankind.  Relating effectively to this present stage of society's evolution is essential to the successful prosecution of the spiritual growth process in our individual lives. Participation in the worldwide Baha'i community is especially helpful in this regard. 

 Such, in its barest outlines, is the process of individual and collective spiritual growth as found in the Bab6'i Writings. Undoubtedly, what remains to be discovered and understood  in the vast revelation of Baha'u'llah is infinitely greater than what we can now understand and greater still than what we have been able to discuss in the present article. 

 But the only intelligent response to this perception of our relative ignorance is not to wait passively until such future time as these deeper implications will have become evident, but rather to act vigorously and decisively on the basis of our limited understanding. 

 Indeed, without such a response to the revelation of Baha'u'llah, we may never arrive at the point where we will be able to penetrate the more subtle and deeper dimensions of the spiritual growth process. 

 No true knowledge is purely intellectual but spiritual knowledge is unique in the breadth of its experiential dimension: it must be lived to become part of us. Nowhere does this truth appear more clearly than in the succinct and powerful coda to Baha'u'llah's Hidden

 that the favour is complete, the argument fulfilled, the proof manifest and the evidence established.

         5. ONE KIND DEED

           DIPCHAND KHIANRA

  Be thankful to God for having enabled you to recognize His Cause. Whoever has received this blessing must, prior to his acceptance, have performed some deed which, though he himself was unaware pf its character, was ordained by God as a means whereby he has been guided to find and embrace the Truth. 

                                            Baha'u'llah

 The Dawn-Breakers, p. 586 NOTHING new or exciting ever seemed to happen in the village of MaryamThAd, in the district of Yazd, in fr6n. Although it was a fair size, the village was far removed from civilization  and lacked the hustle and bustle of a large urban centre. 

 The populace led rather quiet and simple lives. And in all the area there probably could not have been found a more simple, quiet and unsophisticated man than Mihrab6n Rustam 

Bu1bu1~n.                  

 From the moment of his birth Mihrab4n, whose name means 'Kind', had known only a rural life. 

 Farming had been the occupation of his forefathers and it was to become his, as well. Even as a child he saw more of farm and field, mule and plough, tilling and cultivation, than he did of school. For a couple of years he attended the nearest Zoroastrian fire-temple where he learned the alphabet and, without truly understanding them, committed to memory  some prayers from the Avesta, the sacred books of the religion of his forebears. But that was all the education he received. 

 As a young man Mihrab6n began to work in the fields and from that time cm he lost touch with the world outside his own immediate neighbourhood. 

 At the bteak of day he would go to his fields and there he would remain until sunset, day after day, summer and winter. He had no companions except the birds that flew overhead making shrill cries and those which chirped from the trees as he worked. 

 Zoroastrians in IrAn did not then enjoy the rights of first-grade citizens. 

 They could not go about in the town unless they wore their coloured uniforms which served to identify and set them apart. They could not mount a donkey and pass through the bazaar without some ruffian taunting and abusing them. They dared not go out on a rainy day for it was believed by their Muslim neighbours that they would pollute the rain, the symbol of God's mercy. 

 On certain nights word would be passed in whispers through the Zoroastrian quarter: 'Tonight the sacred fire will be lit.' One by one, all would go to the fire-temple and pray in undertones in order not to arouse the wrath of the fanatical element. 

 With all Mihrab6n's simplicity, rustic manners  and lack of formal education, he had implicit faith in God. He would often look up at the sky and marvel at the greatness of the universe. The beauty he saw in nature confirmed his devotion to the Unseen. 

 He would visit the fire-temple as often as he could and pray with a great intensity of heart and soul. Often he would ask the priests questions about God, the Prophet Zoroaster, Avestic Gathas, and the advent of Hooshidar and Shah Bahram Varjavand, but he found the replies of the priests confusing and his perplexity  was compounded. Occasionally doubts would arise in his mind: Will the Promised One come? Will the Muslims accept Him or treat Him as they treat us? Will He come only to emancipate the Zoroastrians or to unite mankind? Are the priests offering us true spiritual guidance? Shall we adhere to our Faith or leave our ways and follow the Promised One as did those who chose to follow Zoroaster? 

 Many such questions arose to trouble MihraMn. 

 Then something happened which proved to be the turning-point in his life. One afternoon while he was working on the land Mihrab6n's attention was attracted by two persons who were running towards him in obvious distress. He observed them silently. When they drew near they raised piteous voices saying, 'Save our lives; give us asylum; we are being pursued by assassins.' Without a word, he

  took them into his barn, showed them a place of concealment and then locked the door. No sooner had he done so than an angry group appeared, their eyes glazed with violent hatred and excitement. 

 They interrogated him as to the whereabouts of the' two persons he had sheltered. Sensing their animosity he denied all knowledge of the existence of the fugitives, and the danger was averted. 

 Towards dawn, the two refugees borrowed Mihrab4n's donkey and, with expressions of gratitude, left his fields in safety. They returned  the next day in order to pay him the price of the animal but he would not accept. Instead, he requested them to accept it as God-sent. 

 Then he asked them why they had been hounded and pursued. They explained that they were followers of 

Baha'u'llah, the Manifestation

 of God, Who was exiled and imprisoned in 'Akka; they were going to leave Iran in order to pay their respects to Him and seek 

His blessing. MihraMn      

 really did not understand their explanation but in his simple and pure-hearted way said, 'When you reach your destination, be so good as to remember me to Him, as well.' 

 After a long and arduous journey the pilgrims at last reached 'Akka. Baha'u'llah was still in prison and it was not possible for them to attain His presence immediately. Consumed with love for Him they would gaze up at His prison cell, content with but a glimpse of His waving hand and yearning to gaze upon His adored countenance. 

 For this they had exposed themselves to every risk and hazard, had journeyed for months, had walked hundreds of miles — just for one glance. They resolved to stay in the Holy Land as long as they could, content to glimpse Him when they could and longing to enter His presence and transmit messages from the friends. 

 XVhen, at last, the pilgrims attained the presence of Baha'u'llah, they stayed for some days pouring out their hearts and relaying the messages of the friends who were unable to come. When they sought Baha'u'llah's permission to return home He astonished them by saying, 'But you did not deliver unto Us all that with which you were entrusted.' 

 What was meant by that statement, the pilgrims asked themselves, and spent a sleepless night fearing that they had incurred the displeasure of their Beloved. At last one of them recalled the Zoroastrian farmer who had saved their lives and had requested to be remembered to the Blessed Beauty. In their ecstasy at finding themselves in the presence of Baha'u'llah they had quite forgotten the incident and Mihrabhn's act of kindness in sheltering them from their pursuers. 

 They hastened to Baha'u'llah and narrated the whole episode. 

 The compassionate heart of the Beloved of the World was moved. He said to the pilgrims that one who wishes to love God must show love to the friends of God. Mihrabhn had extended love spontaneously to these two and had risked his own life to protect them without thought of faVour or reward. Now the ocean of divine grace surged and Baha'u'llah revealed a Tablet for Mihrab6n and arranged for it to be sent to him. Thus this simple farmer was immortalized in a Tablet of extreme  beauty and forcefulness which has been given a place in a compilation of Baha'u'llah's Tablets published under the title 

Ad'fyih-i-Mahbiib  (Prayers
of the Beloved). The       

Universal  House of Justice

 has approved the following English translation of this Tablet: In the Name of God, the 

All-Loving                 

  0 Mihrabdn! One of the friends hath evoked thy remembrance; thus have We remembered thee. 

 In this glorious Day everything that can be seen is a witness, and called-i all men unto the one true God. Say! This is the Day in which the sun of spiritual discernment is shining forth in the heaven of true understanding. 

 Blessed is he that hath perceived and recognized it. Whatsoever  was foretold in former times hath now been fulfilled. 

 Say, 0 friends! Suffer     

 not yourselves to be far removed from the ocean of heavenly grace. He is come astonishingly near unto you. He Who had been concealed from men's eyes is now come. How good is His coming! In one hand He is carrying the water of life and in the other the charter of true liberty. Cast ye away one thing and take hold of another. 

 Cast away whatsoever per-taineth  to the world and take firm hold of that which the hand of divine providence


<p968>
968                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  imparteth unto you. 

 Lo, that which no eye hath ever beheld is now revealed. 0 friends! 

 Hasten ye, hasten ye, hearken ye, hearken ye! 

 The deeds of the high priests have caused the people to be estranged from Almighty God. 

 Instead of evincing self-denial  they have given themselves up to inordinate desires and strayed far from the path of the Lord God. 

 They have grievously erred, yet fondly imagine themselves to be treading the right path. We have, however, warned the leaders of religion and taken them to witness, that they might in this day solemnly affirm His truth and guide His creatures unto the 

Spirit of Purity.        
     Say, 0 high priests!     

 Shake off your slumber, rouse yourselves from unconsciousness,  incline your inner ears to the melody of the All-Sufficing and conduct yourselves in a manner that beseemeth the 

Day of God Himself.      

 Great is the station of him who hath in this Day perceived and become aware of the truth, and wretched is he who hath failed to comprehend the utterances of the Lord of wisdom and to recognize the newly-arrived Friend in His new attire. 

 Behold, the Ocean of true knowledge hat/i appeared and the DayStar of wisdom  shineth resplendent. Incline your ears to the Voice of the Eternal Lord of Utterance and purge yourselves from whatsoever is deemed unseemly, that ye may become worthy to gain admittance into the court of your Creator. Say, in this Day the Almighty hath unloosed His tongue before the assemblage of men. It behoveth you to draw nigh unto Him and to grasp the truths of His weighty utterance. 

 Indeed His utterance is a messenger that beareth the token of His presence. 

 It delivereth you from darkness  and guideth your steps unto the effulgent light of His glory. 

 Thy name was mentioned before Us and We have remembered thee in Our Tablet. This remembrance is like unto a sapling that We have planted with the hand of lovingkindness. 

 Ere long will it grow verdant and flourishing, laden with abundant fruits. Thus hath the Lord God ordained, and thus hath He shown the way; He is the Mighty, the Seeing, the Lord of 

Utterance and Wisdom.    

  'Abdu'l-Baha, too, ever thoughtful of the friends, immortalized MihraMn in a Tablet which He revealed in honour of his kinsmen and in which He bade them to become intoxicated with the love of God, to offer the wine of the Revelation to the people and to rest assured that this is the Day of Victory. 

 After a few years MihraMn Rustam Bul-bu1~n,  now a confirmed believer, settled in India where his daughter, also a staunch and firm Baha'i, had married and made her home. One of his grandchildren, Mrs. Shfrfn Nfir~ni, was named by Shoghi Effendi a Knight of Baha'u'llah for her service in opening to the Faith during the Ten Year Crusade the territory of Karaikal in southern India. His grandson, 

Sh~tptir Khujastig~in    

 pioneered there as well. 

 Mihrab6n was of a retiring nature and he loved Baha'u'llah above all else. He passed away in 1940 when he was past eighty years of age. From his life we glean the important lesson that a good deed performed selflessly may confer immortality upon a humble soul and result in his name being honoured throughout the ages.

    6. KAUSHAL KISHORE BHARGAVA: AN APPRECIATION
       BASED ON A MEMOIR BY DIPCHAND KHLANRA

DR. KAUSHAL KISHORE BHARGAVA

 was born in 1896 into an orthodox Brahmin family in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. At an early age he showed religious inclinations and reputedly ran away from home on several occasions to become a holy man (sadhu). He studied at Agra and then went on to earn his Bachelor of Science degree at the 

University of Allahabad.   

 It was during this time, while still a young man, that he met Professor Pritam Singh1 who was lecturing at the university.  Under the influence of this renowned Baha'i teacher, he accepted the Baha'i 

Faith.                     

 There was at once a change in his life. After obtaining his Master's degree at the Hindu University of Benares, he received a scholarship  from the Indian government to study for his doctorate abroad. This he proceeded to do; but en route to Europe, he stopped off in Haifa and was received by the Master. 'Abdu'l-Baha advised him to change his intended  fie1~i of study, and he became, as a result, a skilled technologist in the sugar industry. 

 On his return to India from the United Kingdom, where he met Shoghi Effendi and Dr. John Esslemont, Dr. Bhargava began his career, and was instrumental in introducing the Baha'i Faith to many people, including the employees under him and the foreign technologists whom he met in the course of his work. His wife, Shyamdulari Bhargava, a pious and high-minded woman who came from a very orthodox Brahmin family, also became a follower of Baha'u'llah. 

 Dr. Bhargava became a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of India and served on that body for many years. 

 He was fearless in his espousal of the Baha'i Cause, even though this brought him the enmity of powerful figures. Yet this audacity also impressed, as in the case of Jawaharlal Nehru, who, having received books and information from Dr. Bhargava, was able to intervene to defend the Baha from persecution in Kamarhati village, near Calcutta. Although asked to join the Congress Party, Dr. Bhar-gava  remained staunch in his adherence to

 Baha'i World, vol. XIII, p. 874. 

 Kaushal Kishore Bhargava   

  Baha'i principles, and his stand was respected. When his wife died he insisted upon her being accorded Baha'i burial rites. 

 She was the first Baha'i from a Hindu background to be buried according to Baha'i law, though this action caused something of a stir at the time. Occurring as it did at the height of the impassioned riots between Hindus and Mus-urns, this was a courageous and dangerous act on his part. 

 Dr. Bhargava was active in speaking fours introducing the Baha'i Faith to the people of India. He was an excellent speaker who had made a deep study of the Sacred Scripture. 

 He placed great store on prayer; for him the Baha'i Faith came first and last. On his passing the

       7. AUGUST FOREL DEFENDS THE PERSECUTED
            PERSIAN BAHA'IS: 1925~19271
                  JOHN PAUL VADER

  A. UGUST FOREL was one of the greatest scientific minds of the latter half of the last century and the beginning of the present century. He gained world renown during his own lifetime for his studies in the fields of entomology, brain anatomy, psychiatry and mental hygiene. He was active in many social reform movements such as temperance, women's rights and world-peace movements. He has been described as 'one of the last representatives of a generation of encyclopedists, of open and curious minds, who took interest in almost all human activities', as 'a glory not only to his Swiss fatherland, but to the whole human race', and as 'the strongest and purest voice of the world's conscience'.2 

 In 1920 August Forel encountered the Baha'i Faith and immediately recognized the striking similarity between his own principles and those proclaimed by Baha'u'llah, Founder of the Baha'i Faith.3 He wrote directly to 'Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'u'llah's eldest son and appointed successor, expressing his admiration  for the Baha'i principles and asking whether he could be considered a Baha'i with his agnostic and Darwinian tendencies. 

 The answe+ he received constitutes one of the most comprehensive statements of the Baha'i conception of the nature of God, of man and of the universe.4 

 Forel became a member of the Baha'i Faith in 1921 and in August of that year he added This article was adapted by the author from a chapter of his book For the Good of Mankind: August Forel and the Baha'i 

Faith (Oxford: George     

 Ronald, Publisher, 1984) and is here printed with the publisher's permission.

 The Baha Faith is a monotheistic religion, founded in the 19th century by Baha'u'llah (The Glory of God) and based on the principles of the oneness of God, the oneness of religion and the oneness of mankind. Cf., e.g., Baha'u'llah and the New

 the following paragraph to his will and testament (which he had written in 1912): 'I wrote the preceding lines in 1912. What must I add today, in August 1921, after such horrible wars have reduced humanity to fire and blood, and at the same time, unmasking as never before, the terrifying ferociousness of our hateful instincts? 

 Nothing, except that we must remain all the more steadfast, all the more unshakable in our struggle for the common good. Our children must not become discouraged; on the contrary,  they must take advantage of the present world chaos in order to further the painful organization, higher and supranational,  of mankind, with the help of a universal federation of peoples. 

 'At Karisruhe, in 1920, I first came to know of the supraconfessional world religion  of the Baha'is, founded in the East more than seventy-five years ago by the Persian Baha'u'llah. This is the true religion of human social good, without dogmas or priests, uniting all men on this small terrestrial  globe of ours. I have become a Baha'i. May this religion live and prosper for the good of mankind; this is my most ardent wish.'5 For the next ten years, until his death in 1931, he undertook activities supporting the Baha'i teachings that are truly impressive. Nothing thwarted his resolve to fulfil his 'most ardent wish'. 

 Among his many activities in favour of these teachings was his defence of the Persian Baha during the wave of persecutions against them in the 1920s. 

 This is particularly interesting when one considers that this community is, at present, once again the target of barbaric cruelties, pogroms, persecutions and martyrdorns. Ever since its inception in the middle of the last century, the Baha'i Faith has been subjected in Persia to waves of open and ruthless persecution.

  political upheaval, as at present, when the Baha'is in particular are singled out as scapegoats.  In the 1920s Persia had recently deposed the Q~jAr dynasty and chosen, with• the support and sanction of the Shfih ecclesiastical hierarchy, Reza Pahiavi, father of the late ShAh as hereditary sovereign. Such an initial period of instability, and uncertainty afforded the traditional enemies of the Baha'i Faith their longed-for opportunity to give open vent to their evil schemes.1 

 The first stirrings of the persecutions occurred almost simultaneously in several provinces in the first months of 1925. Forel learned of these persecutions through Shoghi Effendi, great-grandson of Baha'u'llah and head (Guardian) of the Baha'i Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957. He undertook immediate action to call the atrocities to the attention of the European public. In the following undated letter, sent to the French Foreign Minister and received on 10 April 1925, Forel wrote: The universal religion of the Baha'is, whose twelve principles are enclosed, was founded in 1851 by Baha'u'llah. 

 It is spreading  more and more throughout the world. In spite of the persecutions to which the Baha'is have been subjected by Muslims, the Baha'i Faith has gained about 500,000 followers in Persia. But 'Abdu'l-Baha was forced to take refuge in Haifa in Palestine; he died there in 1922.2 

 'Abdu'l-Baha's successor, Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, is presently head of the movement in Haifa. Two years ago, during an international congress, a Persian Muslim affirmed to me personally the high esteem which the Baha'is have gradually won in Persia.

 irrational and fanatical hatreds of the Mus-urns against innocent Baha'is. 

 Shoghi Effendi writes us that among other things, in the provinces of Fars, Yazd and Khurasan, etc., Muslims are destroying or burning the houses of the Baha'is, and murdering, mutilating or martyring the Baha'is themselves  who offer only passive resistance in keeping with their broad principles. At times they must flee.

 I will merely attempt, with the weakening forces of a crippled old man, to call the attention of the European press and governments to these sad happenings, requesting them, urgently, to exert themselves,  wherever possible, in order to put an end to these unspeakable cruelties, or at least to limit them as much as possible. I can hereby attest that all the Baha I have known have deeply impressed me as pure and shining examples of high moral standards,  of disinterested devotion and of truly international bounty.

Men and women have the same rights everywhere; all forms of slavery and subservience are strongly forbidden. All human beings have the duty to work; for invalids and people without a means of livelihood, the state must provide the latter through the enacting of laws.1 

  On 11 May Dr. J. B. Esslemont2 wrote Forel on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, thanking him for the helpful article and inquiring if arrangements could be made to have it published in other newspapers. Forel replied, according to notes on the letter, and authorized translation and reproduction of the article. According to Ford himself, an 'impartial Turkish translation  of this article was published in a "pro-gressive"  Istanbul newspaper'. On 20 May Shoghi

New Persecutions and Martyrdoms

 of Baha'is I have learned from Shoghi Effendi, the present Head of the interdenominational Baha religion, that, alas! 

 in spite of their innocence, twelve precious members of the Baha'is have just been subjected to a long and atrocious martyrdom and were killed in southern Persia. This is a repetition of previous persecutions without any justification, for the Baha'is refrain from provoking  anyone, in keeping with their sacred principles. They accept in their midst Mus-urns  as they do all other confessions. 

 When, I ask, will Western Europe awake from its indifference and its heedlessness towards this flower of humanity which, by its pfinciples, is fervently exerting itself in order to achieve, all over the earth, a true and effective love of one's fellow man, regardless of his religion. 

 The press of all parties is urgently requested to help us by publishing these lines in order to awaken the consciences. 

 The governments are requested to act with all their power in order to prevent the renewal of such atrocities: they can do this if they wish, of a common accord, by putting pressure on the Persian government. 

  The League of Nations      

 is also requested to take up this matter. This is part of its international and supranational duty of keeping peace among all peoples. In unity there is force. Let us not lose this wonderful opportunity for unity in common action for the good. I will say no more — that should be sufficient. 

 Whoever has doubts can write to the Baha'i Bureau in Geneva for information and documentation.

 Drummond, Secretary-General, along with the following handwritten message: 

Yvorne (Vaud) Switzerland 
        12 May 1926               

 Honoured Sir, I am sending you herewith a short but urgent appeal on behalf of the poor Baha'is, urgently requesting that you take note of it as well as of the explanations on the other attached sheet. I would particularly like to draw your attention to the penultimate paragraph of my appeal which concerns especially the League of Nations. 

 I have been a Baha'i since 1921; the Baha number today over 500,000 adherents. 

 I am counting on you to inform as rapidly as possible the organs of the League of Nations, whom it concerns, of the plight of the persecuted Baha'is in Jahrum; there is no time to lose. 

 Please accept, honoured Sir, the expression  of my noblest sentiments. 

 Dr. A. Forel P.S. Please excuse my bother and my poor handwriting; my arm is paralysed and I am 78 years old.1 

  Forel's letter and a copy of the answer he received are on file in the archives of the League of Nations. 

 The reply must have been a disappointment: I am obliged to inform you that, concerning petitions on behalf of minorities, the League of Nations is only competent if the concerned States have accepted an international agreement concerning the protection  of minorities and if this agreement has been placed under the guarantee of the League of Nations. Such is not the case of Persia, and the League of Nations is thus not competent to undertake action concerning the facts submitted in your request. 

  The following year, in a letter dated 27 April 

1927, Shoghi Effendi      

 again appealed, through his secretary, to Forel for his assistance  and intervention on behalf of the persecuted  Baha'is in Persia. 
                          
August Fore! to Sir Eric  

 Drummond, 12 May 1926, Archives of the League of Nations, Geneva, document no. 41/51398/51398 (also contains answer to Forel from G.C., Directeur de Ia Section des Minorities, pour le Secr~taire g~n&aI). 

 My dear Dr. Forel, I am taking the liberty of sending you enclosed a copy of Shoghi Effendi's letter to the Assemblies in the West, in connection with the martyrdom of still another brother of the 

Faith in Persia.          

 The horrible news of this evil happening has just broken upon us and Shoghi Effendi would be very grateful if you could communicate  the news to some papers in Switzerland and Germany for publication. With all our grief and feelings we can extend no helping hand to our fellow-Bah~'is in that distracted country. 

 All that we can do is to help through publicity, and acquaint humanity in the civilized world with such terrible tales of horror. 

 In the event of publication of the news contained in the enclosed letter, Shoghi Effendi would deeply appreciate it if you could send him a copy of it. Shoghi Effendi added in his own handwriting: My dear and valued coworker: Your letter dated March 24 and the copy of 'Der Freidenker' have safely reached me and I thank you warmly for your continued efforts for the spread of the Baha'i Faith. I trust that the journals with which you are in touch will publish the account given in my letter, and I shall be pleased to receive copies of such publications. 

 Their sufferings,  so heroically borne, surely deserve the most strenuous efforts on our part to give them the widest possible publicity. 

 Your true and grateful coworker, 

                    Shoghi                   

  Forel's notes on the letter indicate that the news was sent to the 'Freidenker', to his printer and to Vienna. An account of the execution appeared in the Neues Wiener Abendblatt on 10 June 1927 under the title 'Martyr of a new Religion: Murder of a Baha'i Forel had earlier published in the Neue Freje Presse of Vienna still another article entitled 'Persecution of the Baha'i Religion:

  of a letter from a Baha'i in Hamad6n that describe the various forms of open and subtle persecution to which the Baha there were being subjected daily. 

 The article ended with this paragraph: Be happy, friends. You are the free servants of God. fly free, sing happily, serve joyously,  remember us always — and pray for us. We all look forward to the day when we will, unhindered, be able to practise our Faith. This hope is strengthened through our Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, that the thick clouds oppressing the horizon of Persia will be dissipated and the sun of freedom will shine on our land, for it is the homeland of 

Baha'u'llah               

  Forel seems to have taken this request for prayer to heart. In the unclassified documents of the Forel papers at the University of Lausanne there exists a small scrap of paper on which he wrote, in French on one side and in German on the other: 

     Baha Prayer for October   
1927.                      

 0 Thou, universal and unknowable God! Suffer us, poor humans on this small terrestrial globe, to work relentlessly for the social good of all mankind, just as Baha'u'llah,  'Abdu'l-Baha, and so many other courageous martyrs have done before us. Suffer us to struggk against our hereditary, voracious, hypocritical and egotistical instincts.  No sweet-sounding slogans, whether spoken or written. Rather good, great and resolute acts, Oniy then, shall we overcome. 

          Amen.

Swiss banknote.  Though   

 efforts to alleviate the sufferings of these innocent servants of humanity often seem (today as in Forel's day) fruitless and frustrating, we can, and certainly must, follow Forel's example and continue to do our utmost to awaken the world's conscience to this crying injustice.

       8. BAHA'U'LLAH AND TIlE FOURTH ESTATE
                    ROGER WHITE

  I Tis little known in the West among students and adherents of the Baha'i 

Faith that Baha'u'llah   

 addressed Himself to the public press. It is necessary to set aside squeamishness to depict the circumstances which brought about His doing so. A spring day in Yazd, a Persian city dating from the fifth century, the seat of numerous mosques, an important centre for the production  of silk carpets. It was the 19th of May, 1891. 

 Exhilarated by the violence it had witnessed,  the excited mob called for the shedding  of more blood of the hated Baha'is. 

 Only two victims remained, young brothers in their early twenties. 

 Already the crowd ha4l been treated to a thrilling spectacle. A young man of twenty-seven,  'Ali-Asghar, had been strangled and his body dragged through the streets to the accompaniment of drums and trumpets. 

 Then Mull6 Mihdi, a man in his eighty-fifth year, had been beheaded and his corpse hauled in similar manner to another quarter of the city where a considerable throng of onlookers, their frenzy mounting with the music, witnessed the decapitation of Aq6 'Alt the youthful brother-in-law of the two young men who had thus far escaped harm. From there the people rushed to yet another sector of Yazd where they relished the sight of 

MulIA 'Aliy-i-Sabzivi     

 having his throat slashed. They then fell upon his body, hacking it to pieces with a spade while he was still alive, and pounded his skull to a pulp with stones. At the moment he was seized he had been addressing the tumultuous gathering, exhorting them to recognize the truth of the New Day, fully aware of his imminent martyrdom and glorying in it. Then, in yet another quarter, the townsfolk rejoiced in slaying Muhammad B6qir. 

 It is reasonable to feel compassion for this rabble. 

 Theirs was a profound and manipulable  ignorance easily inflamed by fanatical rhetoric and capable, with encouragement from figures of authority, of finding expression in acts of depravity and barbarism. The calculating would be among them — those with vested interests, fearful of loss of power and office — and ruffians and idle thrill-seekers• but no doubt many of their number were utterly convinced that their actions were meritorious in the sight of God, would win the approval of His Prophet and priests, and secure their position in the all-important afterlife.  And so their sincere devotion led them to participate in these murders of supposed. enemies of the established order. 

 It is a classic example of what scholars of the phenomenon call 'enantiodromea', the principle by which any extreme — even virtue — if pushed to the limit, grotesquely crosses over into its opposite. 

 Five had died. But two young men remained  and these were to receive the full force of the crowd's savage fury. 

 The music grew wilder, drowning the shouts of the swirling mob which propelled the youths brutally to the public square, MaydTh-i-Kh6n, where an especially theatrical fate, matched to the mood of the crowd, awaited them. 

 The youths, Sons of Aqfi Husayn-i-KAshAni, known as Baha'u'llah, were silk weavers. They had been raised by affectionate parents and had always lived close to the bosom of their family. Everything about them was conventional for that time and place save that they and their parents had embraced the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 It was this circumstance which brought them to the horrific scene on that spring day in Yazd. 

 The young men, with the five other Baha'is whose deaths they had just witnessed, had gathered for a meeting when a surprise raid was conducted on the house and all were carried off. 

 It is said that some ill-disposed  neighbours had alerted the authorities. 

 Good citizens, these, for the pogrom had been instigated by the mujtahid of the city, Shaykh Flasan-i-SabzivTh, acting on instructions of the Governor, Jal6lu'd-Dawlih, and the slaughter of the victims — sanctioned sport for the Muslim populace — could be averted only by their denial of faith. The seven were, in a caricature of trial, invited to renounce their religion. How can the true believer barter or dissemble? Having spurned the offer, all seven were condemned to death


<p976>

  and surrendered to the executioner and the mob who were eager to aid him in his grisly task. 

 The elder brother, age twenty-three, bore the same name as his friend who had died earlier that day — 'AIi-Asghar. He had recently  married and was theTather of an infant daughter. 

The younger, Muhammad      

 Flasan, age twenty-one, has been described by those who knew him as a youth of extreme beauty, delicacy and masculine grace. 

 The official executioner, Afrisiyab, and the chief constable,  MuMrak-KMn had been urged by the Governor to spare Muhammad 1-lasan's life, if possible, by persuading the young man to recant. Were he to do so, he would be welcomed at the residence of the Governor and showered with favours. 

 'Alf-Asghar was dealt with first. Having swiftly affTi7med his refusal to recant, he was beheaded. 

 Then it was his younger brother's turn. The Governor's enticement was extended by the constable to the handsome young man from whom it drew an impatient reply: 'Hurry up! My friends have all preceded  me! 

 Do what you are charged to do!' He was then decapitated. 

 In a burst of showmanship — playing to the cheering crowd — the executioner slit open the boy's stomach, plucked out the heart, liver and intestines, and held them aloft. This exhibitionist gesture  inspired the audience to commit further atrocities. 

 The head of Muhammad Hasan was impaled on a spear and paraded through the city —  again with the accompaniment of music — and suspended on a mulberry tree. The multitude stoned it so viciously that the skull was broken. His body was then cast before the door of his mother's house. Some women darted from the crowd, danced jnto the room where the mother sat, and mocked her. 

 Pieces of the boy's flesh were carried away to be used as a medicament. 

 Then the head of Muhammad I{asan was attached to the lower part of his body and borne with the remains of the other martyrs to the outskirts of the city where they were pelted with stones and finally thrown into a pit in the plain of Salsabfl. 

 The elder brother, 'ALf-Asghar, was not spared ignominy. 

 In an esped~T1y cruel gesture,  the crowd carried his head to the home of his mother and cast it into the room where she sat with her son's young wife. The mother arose, bathed her son's head, and set it outside, admonishing her jeering torturers riot to attempt to return to her what she had given to 

God.                       

 The frenzy had at last reached its climax, and now a carnival atmosphere prevailed. The Governor declared a public holiday and by his order the shops were closed. When evening came the city was illuminated and the populace  gave itself over to festivities. 

 The name of the mother of the two young men has not come down to us; we know her only as Umm-i-Shahid the mother of the martyr, though she lost more than one member  of her family that day. But the magnificence  of her gesture will fire the imagination of generations to come. She lived on into the period of the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha and received from Him at least one Tablet extolling her courage and fortitude, and consoling her in her loss. The young widow of 'All-AsgMr,  Sakfnih SfltTh, chose not to remarry, though she had offers and was urged to do so. Apprised of her plight, 'Abdu'l-Baha invited her and her infant daughter, F6timih Yin, to come to the Holy Land where she had the bounty of serving in His household. 

 Thus all seven lost their lives. It was not, alas, the only occasion upon which a septet of believers was slain in Yazd; similar episodes occurred in July 1955 and as recently as September 1980. There were also many isolated martyrdoms in that city over the years, and an especially devastating upheaval took place in 1903 when many Baha'is lost their lives in various ways, including stabbing and awing, and one even being shot from a cannon by a direct order of JaI6l'ud-Dawlih, the Governor. 

 Baha'u'llah stigmatized this man —  son of Zi11u's-SuLt~n 'The Infernal Tree', and grandson of N6siri'd-Din Shhh — as 'The Tyrant  of 

Yazd'.                     

 The deaths of the seven plunged Baha'u'llah, then living out the penultimate year of His life in the mansion of Baha, into profound grief. The late Hand of the Cause H. M. Balyuz(, in Baha'u'llah, the King of Glory, recounts: 'When news of the death of the Seven Martyrs of Yazd reached them, it brought great sorrow to 

Baha'u'llah. H~jf Mirza

  BTh] writes that for nine days all revelation ceased and no one was admitted into His presence, until on the ninth day they were all summoned. The deep sorrow that surrounded Him. 

 was indescribable. He spoke extensively  about the Q~j~rs and their deeds. Afterwards, He mentioned the events of Yazd; thus sternly did the Tongue of Grandeur speak of Ja1~1u'd-Daw1ih and Zulu's-Su1t~tn.  Then He said: Do not be sad, do not be downcast, do not let your hearts bleed. The sacred tree of the Cause of God is watered by the blood of the martyrs. 

 A tree, unless watered, does not grow and bear fruit. 

 Baha'u'llah also revealed a Tablet, as yet not fully translated into English, honouring the seven martyrs. 

 Sometimes popularly referred to as the 'Tablet to The Times' because of its reference to the most respected and influential newspaper of the day — The Times of 

London                    

 — it is a document of astonishing power. The tone is one of impassioned anguish, the ~Tongue of Grandeur' giving divine expression to our human responses, reflecting even our indignation and bewilderment, our sense of outrage and inconsolableness. 

 Specific reference  is made to the two young brothers and an unusually full description is given of their torture and martyrdom. 

 The Governor's offer of protection for the younger man is mentioned  and even the sector of the square where the youths died is named. Such atrocities, Baha'u'llah exclaims, have not been witnessed in the past nor will again be seen in future. 

 He describes the mutilating of the bodies, alludes to the reward given to the executioner,  the taunting and reviling of the families of the victims, the parading of the head on spear-point through the streets to celebratory  musical accompaniment, the lighting of the city by night, the festival air which prevailed. God knows, He laments, what the oppressed innocents suffered. 

 Then He calls upon the public press of the world — newspapers, in the Baha'i Revelation are exhorted by Baha'u'llah to mirror truth, and all those responsible for their production 'to be sanctified from malice, passion and prejudice, to be just and fair-minded, to be painstaking in their enquiries, and ascertain all the facts in every situation' — to take note of these happenings, to launch an enquiry, to faithfully record these facts and,in effect, to aid in awakening human consciousness to these sacrifices. 

 The Tablet was not delivered to The Times (nor perhaps was intended to be), but in the following excerpt that newspaper  is singled out, it would seem, as representative of the rational spirit of enquiry, of all that is true, praiseworthy and humane in Western thought: O  'Times', 0 thou endowed with the power of utterance! 

 0 dawning place of news! Spend an hour with the oppressed of Irdn, and witness how the exemplars of justice and equity are sorely tried beneath the sword of tyrants. Infants have been deprived of milk, and women and children have fallen captive to the lawless. The blood of God's lovers hath dyed the earth red, and the sighs of His near ones have set the universe ablaze. 

 0 assemblage of rulers, ye are the manifestations of power and might, and the fountainheads of the glory, greatness and authority of God Himself. Gaze upon the plight of the wronged ones. 0 daysprings of justice, the fierce gales of rancour and hatred have extinguished the lamps of virtue and piely. 

 At dawn, the gentle breeze of divine compassion hath wafted over charred and cast out bodies, whispering these exalted words. 'Woe, woe unto you, 0 people of Ir6n! Ye have spilled the blood of your own friends and yet remain in ignorance of what ye have done. 

 Should ye become aware of the deeds ye have perpetrated, ye would flee to the desert and bewail your crimes and tyranny. 

 O misguided ones, what sin have the little children committed? Hat/i anyone, in these days, had pity on the dependants of the oppressed? A report hath reached Us that the followers of the Spirit [Christ] — rnay the peace of God and His mercy be upon Him —  secredy sent them provisions and befriended them out of utmost sympathy. 

 We beseech God, the Eternal Truth, to confirm all in accomplishing that which is pleasing to 

Him.                      

 o newspapers published throughout the cities and countries of the world! Have ye heard the groan of the downtrodden, and have their cries of anguish reached your ears? 

 Or have these remained concealed? It is hoped that ye will investigate the truth of what hath occurred and vindicate it.


<p978>
978                THE BAHA'I WORLD

  In His Tar~zdt Baha'u'llah, Who had, on more than one occasion, been personally slandered and maligned in the press, and His Cause misrepresented in stories fabricated by His avowed enemies, recorded His awareness of inaccurate, perhaps even irresponsible, reporting: 

Concerning this Wronged    

 One, most of the things reported in the newspapers are devoid of truth. Fair speech and truthfulness, by reason of their lofty rank and position, are regarded as a sun shining above the horizon of knowledge. 

 The waves rising from this Ocean are apparent before the eyes of the peoples of the world and the effusions of the Pen of wisdom and utterance are manifest everywhere. 

 It is reported in the press that this Servant hat/i fled from the land of lid rTihr~n1 and gone to 'Irdq. Gracious God! 

 Not even for a single moment hath this Wronged One ever concealed Himself. 

 Rather hath He at all times remained steadfast and conspicuous before the eyes of all men. Never have We retreated, nor shall We ever seek flight. 

 In truth it is the foolish people who flee from Our presence. We left Our home country accompanied by two mounted escorts, representing  the two honoured governments of Persia and Russia until We arrived in 'Irdq in the plenitude of glory and power. Praise be to God! The Cause whereof this Wronged One is the Bearer standeth as high as heaven and shineth resplendent as the sun. Concealment hath no access unto this station, nor is there any occasion for fear or silence. 

 In the same Tablet He extols knowledge and describes the integrity and regard for truth which should govern those who write for newspapers: Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. 

 It is incumbent upon everyone to acquire it. Such arts and material means as are now manifest have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdom which have been revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His 

Most Exalted Pen — a Pen     

 out of whose treasuiy pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of the world are brought to light. 

 In this Day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the eyes of men. 

 The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the world. 

 They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples and kindreds. 

 They both reflect them and make them known. They are a mirror endowed with hearing, sight and speech. 

 This is an amazing and potent phenomenon. However, it bel-toveth the writers thereof to be purged from the promptings of evil passions and desires and to be attired with the raiment of justice and equity. They should enquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain the facts, then set them down in writing. 

  Among the indicators that 'appear as the outstanding characteristics of a decadent society',  corruption of the press is cited by Shoghi Effendi, together with 'the degeneracy of art and music' and the 'infection of literature', in his masterful and succinct analysis in 'The 

Unfoldment of World Civilization'.

 In that same essay, in sketching the broad outlines of the World Order of Baha'u'llah, whose goal is the unification of the planet, he does not fail to mention the lofty and constructive  role to be played by a truly free press. 'The press will, under such a system, he writes, 'while giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and convictions  of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private  or public, and will be liberated from the influence of contending governments and peoples.' 

 No 'mirror of the world' more dramatically reflects the emergence of the Baha'i Faith from obscurity than the press. With the renewed persecution of the Baha'is in the land where the Faith was born — persecution which, despite its instigators' seeming sole concession to enlightenment in the adoption of polite refinements such as closeted firing squads, private hangings and diabolical, exquisitely designed secret tortures, has the same demonic force and malicious purpose as earlier episodes — the media, and particularly the press of the world, on an unprecedented scale, locally, nationally and internationally, has sympathetically, emphatically, eloquently, insistently and for the most part accurately

980                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

       9. AUGUST RUDD: THE FIRST BAnAl PIONEER
                      TO SWEDEN

  AUGUST RUDD was privileged to plant the banner of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in Sweden and to lay the foundation for its development and expansion in that country. He was born on 7 August 1871 in V?irmland, near the Norwegian border. 

 His parents had many children and the family lived with meagre economic resources. 

 Around 1890 August moved to the Norwegian side of the border to live with two of his brothers, Edvin and Otto, who were inventors and who achieved some recognition for their designs for a boat engine and typewriter. 

 In 1893 the three brothers emigrated to the United States. They settled first in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and later in Chicago, Illinois, where they received the Baha message. August wrote to 'Abdu'l-Baha in the autumn of 1919 expressing his wish to return to Sweden and not long thereafter received the following Tablet from the Master: '0 thou son of the Kingdom! 
  'Thy letter was received.  

 Thy desire is to return to Sweden, thy home. 

 In the country of Sweden the call of God is not yet raised. God willing, thou mayst be confirmed to raise the divine call in that country and be the cause of guidance unto a large multitude. 

 Let not this statement look strange to thee, because the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abh6 are powerful. They make the feeble strong, and give feathers and wings to the featherless bird. 

 'The maidservant of God, Miss Knob-loch,1  went from America to Germany. 

 Of course thou hast heard how she stirred Germany and consequently how many souls were guided! 

 Now I supplicate to God that thou mayest be more (than she) confirmed, so that that dark country of the world of nature may be illumined with the heavenly luminosity. 

 Feel assured that confirmation will reach thee '2

 In spite of physical weakness as a result of illness, August sailed from New York on 25 June 1920 and arrived in Sweden the following month. He settled in Boda, V~irm1and, where he became, according to all available information, the first Baha'i pioneer in Sweden. Records show that there had been periodic and temporary Baha'i visitors to Sweden from as early as 1908, but now the country had a resident believer. The following year, 1921, Edvard Olsson also came to Sweden from the United States as a pioneer and settled only a few miles north of Boda. 

 The men had known one another in the United States and they kept in contact with each other until August Rudd's death. 

 Not long after his arrival at his post, August wrote to his fellow believers in the United States through the editors of Star of the West: 'Friends of the Kingdom of E1-Abh6! 

 'Your humble co-servant in the great Cause of God arrived in Sweden the 8th of July. Went to the most remote corner of the country to begin spreading the great Truth, and there I found a pure-hearted soul, who in three weeks accepted the Truth. Highly educated in both Swedish and English, she began to work with me in the Cause. Naturally, progress is very slow, but hope by the grace of God and our beloved '3 Master, will soon grow faster The 'pure-hearted soul' to whom he alluded was Miss Anna Gustavsson, a teacher at Bovikens school, to whom August turned for assistance in translating Baha'i pamphlets into Swedish and to help him improve and refine his knowledge of the language. Within a short time of her acceptance of the Faith they were married. 

 The couple became widely known in their surroundings, due in part to their purchase  of both a motorboat and an automobile which they used for teaching trips in both Sweden and Norway. They also established good relations with the newspapers and had published many articles about the Baha'i Faith and its progress in the world.

                Anna and August Rudd.

  In 1923 the Rudds were paid a visit by Mrs. Louise Ericksson from the United States who presented them with a copy of Dr. John 

E. Esslemont's Baha'u'llah 

 and the New Era, the first edition of which had just been published under the imprint of George Allen & Unwin Ltd., London. 

 As soon as he took the book in his hands, August exclaimed, 'Anna, we shall translate this book!' 

 This they did, and the Swedish translation was published in 1932. 

 The activities of the Rudds in Sweden and Norway were reported in Star of the West, vol. 17, no. 1, April 1926: 'These teachers, together  with Mrs. Louise Ericks[s]on of Brooklyn,  N.Y., who has spent much time in Sweden, and who even while in this country constantly assists the work of the Baha'i Cause in her native land across the sea, have given of their time, effort and all of their resources in ardent devotion to 'Abdu'l-Baha and the divine plan of teaching which He gave to the world. 

 They have not only lived and worked in the large centers of population, but during summer vacations always go by automobile mobile for long teaching tours through the country. 

 'The people of these far northern climes are always much attracted to the Baha'i Teachings for world unity, and when they are awakened, they become very strong adherents of the Faith. They say with one accord, "The 

Teachings  and Principles 

 of the Baha'i Cause are so high and noble, so pure and holy, that we cannot do anything else but work and spread them, and you can count on us as coworkers August Rudd died on 13 February 1926. Anna continued her intensive teaching and translating work. 

 She published several pamphlets  and in 1936, under the direction of Shoghi Effendi, she published the Swedish translation of a second book, the Kitdb-i-Iqdn. Anna also furthered the planning which she and August had begun for the visits of travelling teachers and the settling of pioneers in 

Stockholm and Gothenburg   
with the aim of establishing

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 in those centres as quickly as possible. Sadly, she

  did not live to experience the fulfilment of these goals as she passed away on 27 August 1943 and the first Local Spiritual 

Assembly in Sweden (Stockholm)
did not come into being until

April 1947.                

 August and Anna Rudd are forever inseparably  associated with the establishment and early development of the Baha'i Faith in Sweden. 

 In one of his Letters to them the Guardian said, in effect, that the reports of their activities which they sent to him testified eloquently and powerfully to the dynamic all-conquering spirit of Baha'u'llah working so astonishingly through them. It is for present and future generations of Baha'is in Sweden and Norway to repay their debt of gratitude to these early servants of the Baha Cause in those lands by the brilliance of their exploits in its service and their willingness to become increasingly effective channels of that spirit through which all obstacles are vanquished.

 The sunlight is black The sunlight is black What raven wing Covered my sun at noonday? 

  In my mouth is the salt of tears I cannot swallow so much salt... 

  Blood is so beautiful Blood is so pure Why do the people let blood Run in the street? 

  So long it took To make this man Noble and good His mind and his soul Expanded like sunlight At noonday. 

  Why did you kill him? 

 Are you pleased at this riddled shell, This mangle of bone and flesh? 

 Did you think your deed in the dark Was a bright light? 

  Everything is pulsing, Throbbing and throbbing! 

 There is no answer And the sunlight is black. 

  Go Enoch go! 

 Go to Musa on the hill Go to your Master Go to your Guardian Go to the Kingdom of 

Light!

        Tribute                 

  A translation from Persian of a poem written by a Muslim woman who was a cellmate of one of the recent Baha'i women martyrs. 

 For the author's protection, her name is withheld. 

  Do you remember that you told me 'How tight is our cage! How difficult to breathe in this close and terrible place!' You wanted to sacrifice yourself. I wanted to be freed from prison, but you wanted to sacrifice yourself. You looked at the door of the cell in such a strange way, as though someone called you from heaven. I saw in your gaze the look of a fulfilled and proud lover. 

 I saw the desire for flight in your eyes, as though you were going back to lihe nest. At that moment you murmured into my ears, 'Life is vanity; why should we stay till we rot?' 

 We both said the same thing, that life is meaningless, that at the end we have to go in any case. 

 But behold how beautifully you spread your wings, broke your cage. Your umbrella was of flowers. Now even the Seven Heavens are not vast enough under your feet. 

 How well you knew that to take wing is the best way to go home. You had a power equal to the whole world; your heart was like an ocean. It is my humiliation to see that you are up there and I am still here. 

 I am in this swamp of the earth and you are with your Beloved. I am still drowned in wonderment and you have arrived at your destiny. 

  Do you remember that you told me, 'How tight is our cage! How difficult to breathe in this close and terrible place!' Are you aware that I cannot erase your memory from my heart throughout eternity? You are a proud eagle. My heart is a captive bird. 

  Even if it were not imprisoned, it is a captive in the world. You are not here but have taken to your wings. I stay, and I rot, and I die.

984         THE BAHA'I WORLD
In mid1982, a Baha'i      

 was told that the Islamic court had decreed that he should be put to death. On hearing the decision, he composed the following poem for his son. 

  My Soroush, behold your father and see how perplexed he is. He keeps to himself and muses. 

 He is captive in the hands of the oppressors, like Joseph in the well of Canaan. 
My Soroush..               

 I miss your love and your sweet voice. 

  See how the enemies ruined our home, at this fall season which is followed by winter. 

  You trembled like autumn leaves in the bosom of your mom, when you heard that your father was in the hands of the enemies. 

  They attacked our home. 

 Books, pamphlets and notebooks were all taken, picture of the Beloved too, which was so dear.. 

 At this time I heard a sweet message: Why is the bird of your heart so sorrowful? 

 Don't be so sad; this is the bounty of the 

Beloved                    

 that you are in this prison corner. 

 His calamity is His providence, rejoice. 

 Good for the head which is given for His path. 

 Drink the everlasting wine from the cupbearer's hand. 

 If they took 'Abdu'l-Baha's picture, why worry? it is engraved on the wall of my heart. 

 If they took the prayer book, many tablets are hidden in my heart, If they broke the tapes of the voices of the friends, the bird of my heart is a sweet-singing bird. 

  They cannot drain the fountain of the Sun, even though clouds are now ruling in this region. 

 Look at the tiny prison cells which are filled with the melodies of prayer and the mention of God. 

 Listen to the cry of '0 Baha, 0 my God', which echoes like a thunder and roars. 

  The sound of the 'remover of difficulties' chanted by the friends, flies to the Heaven of God like an eagle. 

  One friend is saying the song of 'Praise be to my God the exalted', and the other is chanting the verse of '0 Beloved look at Thy lovers', One is full of joy from The song of '0 God', and the other is weeping at the chaining of Al-MustaghAth'. 

 One is driflik with the wine of 'Our God the 

Most Pure'                 

 and the other is astonished a~ The inebriety of the wine of 'if there were no calamities'. 

  We must make the most of these various-colored wines, since the cupbearer is the beauty of ifie Beloved. I wonder from which cup I should drink, since there are so many wines in this happy feast. Although the cell is filled with absolute darkness, the beauty of the Beloved is shining in the garden of my heart. 

 If the judge finds out about my joyous state, I am sure that he will regret his decree. Drink from the wine of true understanding in secret, 0 friends, and whip lashes will be your punishment. Look at the degree of the ignorance of the guard, I am fully drunk and he wants order. Thanks to God since with ~he help of the Beloved prison has become a palace to His lovers. 

  B al calar della nofle quella strada scintillante sul mare mi portb in un mondo diverso dove I'oro ~ nei cuori e le gemme nel petto.

    Paul Haney: A Reflection

  No one will stand that tall among the columns of the Bab's Shrine, Your back in its lean grey coat bending to us in the dark, Ushering us delicately into firm belief, like a benediction, like the long, arched curve of humility that bows from self to nothingness before 

Him.                      

  No one will approach the Threshold from such special height, Nor in that same long-boned, sparse-stepped way —  Sway so like the reed to the darting currents of God's will, More obediently gather greatness down to the scattered petals there. 

  Oh, blessing — that once we witnessed this, Witnessed you backing to the door so awkwardly graceful, That we were privileged to walk the gravelled path beside you from the Shrine, Pacing our steps with yours over the acquiescent stones. 

 ...     somewhere in the list could we perhaps slip a plea for consideration that we surrendered our lives that men may be happy and free? 
     From last letter of Mihdi 

Anvari                    

 executed in Shfr6z 17 March 1981 Do you remember now as you went on your way many a holiday with your rogue children running on and the whole world blue and gold under the blazening sun and the ornamental streams whispering paradisal promises in Sa'di's Garden and the scintillating roses scented like rose-water —  — do you remember if perchance you saw him —  that silent man who gave his life for you?

  This is no tepid milky tea-drink for swallowing mildly in shallow conversations. 

 This drink burns strong and bold on tongues yet tastes as sweet as honey. 

  It gathers courage thrusting forward the prior timid towards lands of crawling grasses and stands them under flying bat-wings to test the bitterness. 

  The hearts beat louder with each deep drink slowly drawn from the cup of golden utterances. A zealous song begins its bleating on lovers' battlefields: 'Loving, loving' (in flOW translation) 'for dying ties the lovers' knot, iii a chain a dancing chorus chasing down a worldly rot. Slipping through the hangman's fingers from the noose escapes the sigh; they cannot slice a soul in splinters; they cannot quell the joyous cry.

988                 THE BAFIA'[ WORLD

               The Banishment

 Accompanied by a number of frail-bodied men and children of tender age' It is how one imagines that Long winter trek over bleak and wind-scarred ranges as this day, reaching its sparing light forces us to spend another night against a whispering mountain. 

  Three months the journey lasted through hardships and hunger and the sharpest embrace of cold, sometimes He rode in the howdab ill after being so long in chains, into that frigid strangulating air whose sharpest gales extended so negligently against them through sweeps of drifting snow that often blocked their passage —  until the single officer from the Imperial guard yearned only to turn back. 

  Caught in the currents of air we slip into the deep crevice of blue-gray rock as the evening advances, all manner of thoughts retreating somewhere out there above the tree line. 

  One   sees —  the opal mists gathering them in drawing together like glassy pearls the cluster of frozen tents so stark in the scaling wind, the pungent scent of horses breathing heavier than before their frosted manes now silver against the extending dark. 

  His eldest Son, barely a youth chanting in chilled air within a frugal atmosphere, everyone lapsing to silence as the gentle sounds of the prayer ascend the lamplight shadows. 

  Through purple daybreak between rain and singing wind we descend, impatient to catch the sun's clear warmth continually caught up by that deliberate banishment. One is overwhelmed by just the thought —  a throat accustomed to the touch of silk scarred and insensibly maimed by rusted iron fetters. 

 And there —  His daughter-child cloaked in the mistral morning a shield to the negative cold, her attitudes transform the day rekindle their tranquillity. 

  Beyond each obscure summit they move so slowly forward into a dazzling austere sun which soon expands to merge one vague plateau into another. The world, like those callous heights, indifferent to His journey. 

  Yet   picture —  the peasantry blinking into the white light, no doubt insensible to frost bite leaning forward, anxious to meet those Exiles: to see His face —  to touch His robe —  to catch one glimpse —  might soften the untamed heart obliterate the harshness. 

  One   overhears —  'The gentle Lady offered us golden buttons in exchange for a little cooking oil and a small amount of rice.' 

  The village people sensed a Great One passed among them accepting deprivation that man might gain immaculate 

Fire                      

  Believing —  When He departed they would see Him again and again in memory, recalling it through an everchanging light, the arching winter sun framing His shoulders. 

  Crossing this icy scree each pebble seems to shine in pristine glaze a mass of beauty —  but oh, how profusely in the flush of spring can one visualize the fragile mountain flowers blooming where He had restedl

   Indivisible from Us        

 I believe many of us share today deep pain for the waste of the precious lives of children everywhere. 

  Indivisible from us, these children walk their last inevitable miles —  a marathon from no free choice —  hoping to snap the finish line alive. 

 When they cross bridges they cannot recall a starting point, nor see how near to the race end: just catch their breath, and take one further step. 

  They die and live in us, these children, holding spirit tight to body, as if a loosening grasp might mean a stop, an end too soon — without a second chance, no way to travel back. Tomorrow, brothers, sisters, may well not start the trek, lie under blankets at some camp, having overslept their human time. 

  Victor de Araujo (U.S.A.) 

         Lullaby                    

 — for the sleeping ones —  In the heart of a stone A bird grew wings Grew eager to break From gravity in flight. 

 He thought: 'there, in the air's open cage, Is my realm — my first and natural domain.' 

 Bird into bird he then became, His wings opening in ecstasy The stone ceasing to function about him. 

 The air became a kingdom of waves and paths And he had motion to express, to celebrate Becoming a truth in, the joy of a truth found As much as you in the empire of dreams may know.

          Elegy                      

  Here in the Gardens, on the paths Where sparrows with brown tabby wings Skip bright and simple Catching up each pilgrim's crumbs, On the shaded sward where blackbirds Prance and cock their saffron beaks, Where a red crowned woodpecker, upside down, Hammers at silver twisted bark —  Here in these Gardens we walk and grieve The scars on one child's downy leg, The mark of every stone that's flung, The deaths in prison, told, The loss of every dear and helpless man. 

  Yet in these gentle Gardens, at dusk A robin trebles undisturbed, And, at dawn, surprised by prayers, Frail ears flick, a rabbit scuds Breathless among roses, unpursued —  And stories weep from lip to lip, The honour of dishonoured names, A peasant woman's burning hair, Raped innocents, their souls unstained, And payment for each bullet used. 

  While here, in our sweet Gardens, still, Green wood-sparrows will bow the twigs Of Cypress trees, and sunbirds Flicker among shifting leaves Where purple bougainvillaca teems, And blossoms ripen into fruit, even As the broad summer's flame tree flourishes.

                     Having loved Thee     

 first in contemplation sweet prayer and my soul's debauch (drunken with Thy wine); dropping daily to the knee in adoration to all things as I thought preferring Thee (or else that uterine sensation); I was none the less rocked, held in holy arms and fed. Filled were all the empty places deserts, grey desolate dead stretches of loneliness and my bloodless heart devoid of all graces, blessed and brought to moist and beating life. 

  A living heart, pulsing with the rhythmic dance of feeling servant of a serving soul finds less time for kneeling. 

  Carol G. Handy (U.S.A.) 

                      Why I Like Religion   

  Some people say it's an existential guilt reaction Due to anxiety repressed during childhood, And only now,coming to the fore. 

  Some people say it's a miracle. 

  Some people tell me it's related To being helpless, and wanting to change the system. 

 Other j~eopIe are very sure That it's because I have a sense of my own mortality, Or perhaps a vague awareness Of some of the larger themes in life. 

  Some people say it's because I hate my mother. 

  I say it is waking to wind chimes, The sound of rain, The smell of bacon, The sudden jolt of spiders on my skin, And the knowledge that sometimes People aren't enough. 

  I say it comes from dying, And living again.

             Aunque Somos Asi

  Somos los cimientos de una nueva tierra, somos las semillas de un nuevo jardin. 

 Ingenuos, sencillos, humildes y pobres, con mu problemas, con mu deficiencias hemos sido escogidos para ser transformados, para ser portadores de una nueva luz. 

  Dc negros carbones nos ha hecho Dios sus diamantes; de granos de arena, ahora somos sus perlas mejores; somos las gotas de agua transverberadas por la Gloria del Sol. 

  Ninguno se puede gloriar de si mismo, nada de m6rito es nuestro. 
No ha hecho falta casi ni valor.

 Sdlo dejarse ilevar como la hoja en ci viento por Ia Fuerza Suprema que todo lo elige, lo cambia, lo eleva, lo orienta a sn fin. 

  Somos las piedras de la celestial Kaaba, Somos los ladrillos de una nueva Jerusakn. 

 Nuestra fuerza es let esperanza de que el Ma ha liegado, Ia obra est6 en marcha y surge radiante una Nueva Ciudad, Ia ciudad sin santuario, sin sol y sin luna porque sdlo Ia alumbra la Gloria de Dios.

  tQu~ pudiera yo decir, cuando siento en mi el reflector potente de tu amor, que atraviesa lado a lado cual espada enmorada, mi alma triste y torturada por el mundo y ci dolor? 

  tQ~~ pudiera yo decir, cuando siento que me envuelves en tu hMito divino y me Ilevas tras de U; que me arrastras con tu manto, tu mirada y tu bondad, y me lievas al sendero de una gran tranquilidad? 

  Bab — Heraldo, Puerta, nacido en Oriente y fulgor de Occidente, rayo matriz de Ia unidad, espejo radiante que proyecta el fulgurante anhelo de la humanidad; yo te declaro protector, iniciador, canalizador, orientador, oc~ano inmenso que bafia con sus olas Ia maravillosa tierra que nos vid nacer. Sos el precursor de la armonia y de la maravillosa gracia que Dios manifest6, SOS la base principal y punto de apoyo espiritual de Ia fuerza redentora. Sos el lazo universal que une corazones, sos ci alma de 'cristal' que riega bendiciones.

992        THE BAHA'I WORLD
                         Lines from Last Letters

  (On reading letters written in 1980 — 1981, by Baha'i prisoners in Iran, to their families, within an hour of their execution for refusing to recant their faith.) 

  How simply the fictive hero becomes the real; How gladly with proper words the soldier dies If he must. 

                 Wallace Stevens

  I leave a wristwatch and a blanket; please collect them Brought to the extremes of our commitment let us not speak of torture but say death simplifies our gestures, pries us from abstractions. 

 The cloak and flourish put aside we seek a hunible order, a final dignity, our testament the cordial instruction of vacationing householder to milkman. 

  If I have offended anyone I ask forgiveness Finality too has its protocol. 

 If we die well and decorously it is our sanctioned custom. 

 We are reconciled to our convention though no one sees and the world's cameras and microphones distractedly avert their glance. We have heroic models in these matters, know our end has meaning if only light and shade come clear again in a blurred age. 

  I had no time to finish weaving bracelets for our daughters Reasonable men desire to leave mementoes and we are reasonable men, moderate even in our regret and gladness. 

 Death might blush to call us from our innocent concerns but nothing checks that wastrel's rasher whims. 

  Kiss the children for me and beg them not to mourn How simple it all is, the human pang domesticated in a penstroke. 

 Even the callous might not deplore our final modest question, the one we cannot put to God: My dearest wife, are you well pleased with me? 

  Lord, Lord! accept these as the proper words. 

                            Roger White (Israel)

         On Time

 Riding my days like humpbacked whales     Riding the creature He formed for me or dolphins that dauntlessly dart,    that dies when we once arrive, wondering when it will start:    hoping to get there alive the Day of Light with its timeless sails,  where the sun is the essence of sea. 

 Riding leviathan-style — Dolphins, whales, must you dive, above, beneath, and in-between —   must you plunge so endlessly? 

 can't view the sunstruck scene or see supernal smile.
