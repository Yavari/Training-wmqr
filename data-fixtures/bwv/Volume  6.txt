INTRODUCTION

  DURING the past ten years the Baha'i community of East and West has learned to anticipate each successive volume of THE BAHA'I WORLD (the first number was entitled Baha'i Year Book") as the best means by which the individual believer may keep abreast of the steady development of the Faith throughout the world. This work, in its illustrations as well as in its text, has recorded as completely as possible the progress of current Baha'i events and activities over an area now embracing forty countries. In addition, each volume has presented those Thistorical facts and fundamental principles that constitute the distinguishing features of the Message of Baha'u'llah to this age." 

 The existence of so many evidences of a newly revealed Faith and Gospel for a humanity arrived at a turning point in its spiritual and social evolution has likewise a profound significance for the nonBahA'i student and scholar who desires to investigate the world religion founded by the Bab and Baha'u'llah. For in these pages the reader encounters both the revealed Word in its spiritual power, and the response which that utterance has evoked during the first ninety years of the Baha'i era. He will find what is unparalleled in religious history — the unbroken continuity of a divine Faith from the Manifestation onward through three generations of human experience, and will be able to apprehend what impregnable foundations the Baha'i World Order rests upon in the life and teachings of the Bib and Baha'u'llah, the life and interpretation of tAbdu'1-. 

 Baha, and (since the year 1921) in the development of an administrative order under the direction of the Guardian of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi. 

 It is the avowed faith of Baha'is that this Revelation has established upon earth the spiritual impulse and the definite principles necessary for social regeneration and the attainment of one true religion and social order throughout the world. In THE BAHA'I WORLD, therefore, those who seek a higher will and wisdom than man possesses may learn how, amid the trials and tribulations of a decadent society, a new age has begun to emerge from the world of the spirit to the realm of human action and belief.

TUE BAUA'J WORLD
              AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE
                    BAHA'I FAITH
                  B~ HORACE HOLLEY

1.  A WORLDWIDE SPIRITUAL COMMUNITY
 re7~he Tabernacle of Unity has been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers.

  Of one tree are ye all the fruit and of one bough the leaves.   The world is but one country and mankind its citizens." — BAHA'U'LLAH. 

  UPON the spiritual foundation established  by Baha'u'llah during the forty year period of His Mission (18531892), there stands today an independent religion represented  by nearly eight hundred local communities of believers. These communities geographically are spread throughout all five continents. In point of race, class, nationality and religious origin, the foLlowers  of Baha'u'llah exemplify well-nigh the whole diversity of the modern world. They may be characterized as a true cross-section  of humanity, a microcosm which, for all its relative littleness, carries within it individual men and women typifying the macrocosm of mankind. 

 None of the historic causes of association served to create this worldwide spiritual community. Neither a common language, a common blood, a common civil government,  a common tradition nor a mutual grievance acted upon Baha'is to supply a fixed center of interest, or a goal of material advantage. 

 On the contrary, membership in the Baha community in the land of its birth even to this day has been a severe disability, and outside of I r~n the motive animating believers has been in direct opposition to the most inveterate prejudices of their environment. 

The Cause of Baha'u'llah  

 has moved forward without the reinforcement  of wealth, social prestige or other means of public influence. 

 Every local Baha'i community exists by the voluntary association of individuals who consciously overcome the fundamental sanctions evolved throughout the centuries to justify the separations and antagonisms of human society. In America, this association means that white believers accept the spiritual equality of their Negro fellows. In Europe, it means the reconciliation of Protestant  and Catholic upon the basis of a new and larger faith. In the Orient, Christian, Jewish and Muhammadan believers must stand apart from the rigid exclusiveness into which each was born. 

 The central fact to be noted concerning  the nature of the Baha'i Faith is that it contains a power, fulfilled in the realm of conscience, which can reverse the principle momentum of modern civilization — the drive toward division and strife — and initiate  its own momentum moving steadily in the direction of unity and accord. It is in this power, and not in any criterion upheld by the world, that the Faith of Baha'u'llah has special significance. 

 The forms of traditional opposition vested in nationality, race, class and creed are not the oniy social chasms which the Faith has bridged. There are even more implacable, if less visible differences between types and temperaments, such as flow inevitably from the contact of rational and emotional individuals, of active and passive dispositions, :3

  undermining capacity for cooperation in every organized society, which attain mutual  understanding and harmony in the Baha'i community. For personal congeniality,  the selective principle elsewhere continually operative within the field of voluntary action, is an instinct which Baha'is must sacrifice to serve the principle of the oneness of mankind. A Baha'i community,  therefore, is a constant and active spiritual victory, an overcoming of tensions which elsewhere come to the point of strife. No mere passive creed nor philosophic gospel which need never be put to the test in daily life has produced this world fellowship devoted to the teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 The basis of self-sacrifice on which the Baha'i community stands has created a religious  society in which all human relations are transformed from social to spiritual problems. 

 This fact is the door through which one must pass to arrive at insight of what the Faith of Baha'u'llah means to this age. 

 The social problems of the age are predominantly political and economic. 

 They are problems because human society is divided into nations each of which claims to be an end and a law unto itself and into classes each of which has raised an economic theory to the level of a sovereign and exclusive  principle. 

 Nationality has become a condition which overrides the fundamental  humanity of all the peoples concerned, asserting the superiority of political considerations over ethical and moral needs. Similarly, economic groups uphold and promote social systems without regard to the quality of human relationships experienced in terms of religion. Tensions and oppo sitions between the different groups are organized for dominance and not for reconciliation.  Each step toward more complete partisan organization increases the original tension and augments the separation of human beings; as the separation widens, the element of sympathy and fellowship on the human level is eventually denied. 

 In the Baha'i community the same tensions  and instinctive antagonisms exist, but the human separation has been made impossible. 

 The same capacity for exclusive doctrines is present, but no doctrine representing  one personality or one group can secure a hearing. All believers alike are subject to one spiritually supreme sovereignty in the teachings of Baha'u'llah. Disaffected individuals may withdraw, The community remains. 

 For the Baha'i teachings are in themselves principles of life and they assert the supreme value of humanity without doctrines which correspond to any particular environment or condition. 

 Thus members of the Baha'i community realize their tensions and oppositions as ethical or spiritual problems, to be faced and overcome in mutual consultation. Their faith has convinced them that the "truth" or c~right~~ of any possible situation is not derived from partisan victory but from the needs of the community as an organic whole. 

 A Baha community endures without disruption because only spiritual problems can be solved. When human relations are held to be political or social problems they are removed from the realm in which rational will has responsibility and influence. The ultimate result of this degradation of human relationships is the frenzy of desperate strife — the outbreak of inhuman war. 
                           
               2. THE RENEWAL OF FAITH

 ~%Vheref ore (he Lord of Mankind has caused His holy, divine Manifestations to come into the world. He has revealed His heavenjy books in order to establish s~irituai brot her-hood, d, and through the power of the Holy Spirit has made it possible for perfect fraternity to be realized among lnankind." — tABDU'L-BAHA. 

  In stating that the Cause  social principle or community. 

 of Baha'u'llah is an independentThe teachings  of Baha'u'llah religion, two essential factsare no artificial synthesis assembled are implied.               from the modern library The first fact is that     of international  truth, the Baha'i Cause historicallywhich might be duplicated from was not an offshoot of     the same sources. Baha'u'llah any prior                  created

  a reality in the world of the soul which never before existed and could not exist apart from Him. 

 The second fact is that the Faith of Baha'u'llah is a religion, standing in the line of true religions: Christianity, Mukammadan-isin, Judaism and other prophetic Faiths. Its existence, like that of early Christianity, marks the return of faith as a direct and personal experience of the will of God. Because  the divine will itself has been revealed in terms of human reality, the followers of Baha'u'llah are confident that their personal limitations can be transformed by an inflow of spiritual reinforcement from the higher world. It is for the privilege of access to the source of reality that they forego reliance upon the darkened self within and the unbelieving society without. 

 The religious education of Baha'is revolutionizes their inherited attitude toward their own as well as other traditional religions. 

 To Baha'is, religion is the life and teachings of the prophet. By identifying religion with its founder, they exclude from its spiritual reality all those accretions of human definition, ceremony and ritualistic practice emanating from followers required from time to time to make compromise with an unbelieving world. 

 Furthermore, in limiting religion to the prophet they are able to perceive the oneness of God in the spiritual oneness of all the prophets. 

 The Baha'i born into Christianity can wholeheartedly  enter into fellowship with the Baha'i born into Muhammadanism because both have come to understand that Christ and Mubammad reflected the light of the one God into the darkness of the world. If certain teachings of Christ differ from certain teachings of Moses or 

Muhammad, the Baha'is      

 know that all prophetic teachings  are divided into two parts: one, consisting  of the essential and unalterable principles of love, peace, unity and cooperation,  renewed as divine commands in every cycle; the other, consisting of external practices (such as diet, marriage and similar ordinances) conforming to the requirements of one time and place. 

 This Baha teaching leads to a profounder  analysis of the process of history. 

 The followers of Baha'u'llah derive mental integrity from the realization made so clear and vivid by cAbdu~I~BabA that true insight into history discloses the uninterrupted and irresistible working of a Providence not denied nor made vain by any measure of human ignorance and tinfaith. 

 According to this insight, a cycie begins with the appearance of a prophet or manifestation  of God, through whom the spirits of men are revivified and reborn. The rise of faith in God produces a religious community,  whose power of enthusiasm and devotion releases the creative elements of a new and higher civilization. 

 This civilization  comes to its fruitful autumn in culture and mental acbievement, to give way eventually  to a barren winter of atheism, when strife and discord bring the civilization to an end. 

 Under the burden of immorality, dishonor and cruelty marking this phase of the cycle, humanity lies helpless until the spiritual leader, the prophet, once more returns in the power of the Holy Spirit. 

 Such is the BabEl reading of the book of the past. 

 Its reading of the present interprets  these world troubles, this general chaos and confusion, as the hour when the renewal of religion is no longer a racial experience, a rebirth of one limited area of human society, but the destined unification of humanity itself in one faith and one order. It is by the parable of the vineyard that lBahA'is of the Christian West behold their tradition and their present spiritual reality at last inseparably joined, their faith and their social outlook identified, their reverence for the power of God merged with intelligible grasp of their material environment. 

 A human society which has substituted creeds for religion and armies for truth, even as all ancient prophets foretold, must needs come to abandon its instruments of violence and undergo purification until conscious, humble faith can be reborn.

                3. THE BASIS OF UNITY

 eCTloe best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may confide in thee." — BAHA'U'LLAH. 

 Faith alone, no matter how wholehearted and sincere, affords no basis on which the organic unity of a religious fellowship can endure. The faith of the early Christians was complete, but its degree of inner conviction  when projected outward upon the field of action soon disclosed a fatal lack of social principle. 'Whether the outer expression of love implied a democratic or an aristocratic order, a communal or individualistic society, raised fundamental questions after the crucifixion of the prophet which none had authority to solve. 

 The Baha'i teaching has this vital distinc-don, that it extends from the realm of conscience and faith to the realm of social action. It confirms the substance of faith not merely as source of individual development  but as a definitely ordered relationship to the community. Those who inspect the Baha'i Cause superficially may deny its claim to be a religion for the reason that it lacks most of the visible marks by which religions are recognized. 

 But in place of ritual or other formal worship it contains a social principle linking people to a community, the loyal observance of which makes spiritual faith coterminous with life itself. The Baha'is, having no professional clergy, forbidden ever to have a clergy, understand that religion, in this age, consists  in an "attitude toward God reflected in life." They are therefore conscious of no division between religious and secular actions. 

 The inherent nature of the community created by Baha'u'llah has great significance at this time, when the relative values of democracy, of constitutional monarchy, of aristocracy and of communism are everywhere  in dispute. 

 Of the Baha'i community it may be declared  definitely that its character does not reflect the communal theory. The rights of the individual are fully safeguarded and the fundamental distinctions of personal endowment  natural among all people are fully preserved. 

 Individual rights, however, are interpreted in the light of the supreme law of brotherhood and not made a sanction  for selfishness, oppression and indifference. 

 On the other hand, the Baha'i order is not a democracy in the sense that it proceeds from the complete sovereignty of the people, whose representatives are limited to carrying out the popular will. 

 Sovereignty, in the Baha'i community, is attributed to the divine prophet, and the elected representatives of the believers in their administrative  function look to the teachings of Baha'u'llah for their guidance, having faith that the application of His universal principles is the source of order throughout the community. 

 Every Baha'i administrative body feels itself a trustee, and in this capacity stands above the plane of dissension and is free of that pressure exerted by factional groups. 

 The local community on April 21 of each year elects by universal adult suffrage an administrative body of nine members called the Spiritual Assembly. 

 This body, with reference to all Baha'i matters, has sole power of decision. 

 It represents the collective conscience of the community with respect to Baha activities. Its capacity and power are supreme within certain definite limitations. 

 The various local communities unite through delegates elected annually according to the principle of proportionate representation  in the formation of a National Spiritual Assembly for their country or natural geographical area. This National Spiritual Assembly, likewise composed of nine members, administers all national Baha affairs and may assume jurisdiction of any local matter felt to be of more than local importance. Spiritual Assemblies, local and national, combine an executive, a legislative and a judicial function, all within the limits set by the Baha'i teachings. 

 They have no resemblance to religious bodies which can adopt articles of faith and regulate  the processes of belief and worship. They are primarily responsible for the maintenance of unity within the Baha


<p7>
AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE BAHA'I FAITH          7

  community and for the release of its collective power in service to the Cause. Membership in the Baha community is granted, on personal declaration of faith, to adult men and women. 

    Nine National Spiritual    

 Assemblies have come into existence since the passing of tAbdu'1-BaM in 1921. 

Each National Spiritual    

 Assembly will, in future, constitute  an electoral body in the formation of an International Spiritual Assembly, a consummation which will perfect the administrative  order of the Faith and create, for the first time in history, an international tribunal representing a worldwide community  united in a single faith. 

 Baha'is maintain their contact with the source of inspiration and knowledge in the sacred writings of the Faith by continuous prayer, study and discussion. 

 No believer can ever have a finished, static faith any more than he can arrive at the end of his capacity for being. The community has but one meeting ordained in the teachings — the general meeting held every nineteen days, on the first day of each month of nIneteen days given in the new calendar established by the Bib. 

    This Nineteen Day Feast    

 is conducted simply and informally under a program divided into three parts. The first part consists in the reading of passages from writings of Baha'u'llah, the Bib and tAbdu'1-BaM — a devotional meeting. Next follows general discussion of Baha'i activities  — the business meeting of the local community. After the consultation, the community breaks bread together and enjoys fellowship. 

 The experience which Baha is receive through participation in their spiritual world order is unique and cannot be paralleled  in any other society. Their status of perfect equality as voting members of a constitutional body called upon to deal with matters which reflect, even though in miniature,  the whole gamut of human problems and activities; their intense realization of kinship with believers representing so wide a diversity of races, classes and creeds; their assurance that this unity is based upon the highest spiritual sanction and contributes a necessary ethical quality to the world in this age — all these opportunities for deeper and broader experience confer a privilege that is felt to be the fulfilment of life. 
                           
            4. THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW DAY

 man is left in his natural state, he will become lower than the animal and continue to grow more ignorant and imperfect. The savage tribes of Central Africa are evidence of this. Left in their natural condition, they have sunk to the lowest depths and degrees of barbarism, dimly groping in a world of mental and moral obscurity. 

 God has purposed that the darkness of the world of nature shall be dispelled and the i-rnperfect attributes of the natal self be effaced in the eflulgent reflection of the Sun of ~ The complete text of the Baha'i sacred writings has not yet been translated into English, but the present generation of believers  have the supreme privilege of possessing the fundamental teachings of Baha'u'llah,  together with the interpretation and lucid commentary of cAbdu)I~Bahi, and more recently the exposition made by Shoghi Effendi of the teachings concerning the world order which Baha'u'llah came to establish. Of special significance to Baha'is of Europe and America is the fact that, unlike 

 Christianity, the Cause   

 of Baha'u'llah rests upon the prophet's own words and not upon a necessarily incomplete rendering of oral tradition. Furthermore, the commentary  and explanation of the Baha'i gospel made by CAbdu~1~Bah& preserves the spiritual  integrity and essential aim of the revealed text, without the inevitable alloy of human personality which historically served to corrupt the gospel of 

 Jesus and Muhammad. The   

 Baha'i, moreover, has this distinctive advantage, that his approach to the teachings is personal and direct, without  the veils interposed by any human intermediary. 

 The works which supply the Baha'i teachings to English-reading believers are: 

 ~~The Kit4b-i-tqAn" (Book 
 of Certitude),


<p8>

  in which Baha'u'llah revealed the oneness of the prophets and the identical foundation of all true religions, the law of cycles according to which the prophet returns at intervals of approximately one thousand years, and the nature of faith; (CHidden Words," the essence of truths revealed by prophets in the past; prayers to quicken the soul's life and draw individuals and groups nearer to God; "Tblt of Baha'u'llah" (Tar&z~t, The Tablet of the World, Kali-mitt,  Tajalliy6x, Bish6x&t, Ishriq6x), which establish social and spiritual principles for the new era; "Three 

Tablets of Baha'u'llah" (Tablet

 of the Branch, Kitib-i-tAhd, Lawl~-i-Aqdas),  the appointment of cAbdu~1~BaM as the 

Interpreter of Baha'u'llah's

 teachings, the Testament of Baha'u'llah, and His message  to the Christians; (cEpistle to the Son of the Wolf," addressed to the son of a prominent iMnian who had been a most ruthless oppressor of the believers, a Tablet which recapitulates many teachings Baha'u'llah  had revealed in earlier works; "Glean-ings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah." The significant Tablets addressed to rulers of Europe and the Orient, as well as to the heads of American republics, about the year 1870, summoning them to undertake measures for the establishment of Universal Peace, constitute a chapter in the compila-don entitled ~tBaM'i Scriptures." 

 The published writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha are: "Some Answered Questions," dealing with the lives of the prophets, the interpretation  of Bible prophecies, the nature of man, the true principle of evolution and other philosophic subjects; "Mysterious Forces of Civilization," a work addressed to the people of IrAn about forty years ago to show them the way to sound progress and true civilization; "Tablets of ~ three volumes of excerpts from letters written to individual believers and Baha'i communities, which illumine a vast range of subjects; ttPromulgation of Universal Peace," in two volumes, from stenographic records of the public addresses delivered by the Master to audiences in Canada and the United States during the year 1912; "The Wisdom of tAbdu~1~BahA,~~ a similar record of His addresses in Paris; " cAbdu~1Bah4 in London"; and reprints of a number of mdi — vidual Tablets, especially that sent to the Committee for a Durable Peace, The Hague, Holland, in 1919, and the Tablet addressed to the late Dr. Forel of Switzerland. 

The Will and Testament    

 left by cAbdu~1Bah4 has special significance, in that it provided for the future development of Baha'i administrative institutions and the 

Guardianship.            

 To these writings is now to be added the book entitled "Baha'i Administration," consisting of the general letters written by Shoghi Effendi as Guardian of the Cause since the Master's death in 1921, which explain  the details of the administrative order of the Cause, and his letters on World Order, which make clear the social principles  imbedded in Baha'u'llah's Revelation. 

 The literature has also been enriched by Shoghi Effendi's recent translation of tcThe Dawn-Breakers," Nabil's Narrative of the Early Days of the Baha'i Revelation, a vivid eyewitness accoUnt of the episodes which resulted from the announcement of the Bib on May 23, 

1844. "The Traveller's    

 Narrative,"  translated from a manuscript given by tAbdu~1Bah~ to the late Prof. Edward G. Browne of Cambridge University, is the only other historical record considered authentic from the Baha'i point of view. 

 'When it is borne in mind that the term (creligious literature" has come to represent a wide diversity of subject matter, ranging from cosmic philosophy to the psychology of personal experience, from efforts to understand the universe plumbed by telescope and microscope to efforts to discipline the passions and desires of disordered human hearts, it is clear that any attempt to summarize the Baha'i teachings would indicate the limitations of the person making the summary rather than offer possession of a body of sacred literature touching the needs of man and society at every point. The study of Baha'i writings does not lead to any simplified program either for the solution of social problems or for the development  of human personality. Rather should it be likened to a clear light which illumines whatever is brought under its rays, or to spiritual nourishment which gives life to the spirit. The believer at first chiefly notes the passages which seem to confirm his own


<p9>
AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE BAHA'I FAITH         9

  personal beliefs or treat of subjects close to his own previous training. 

 This natural but nevertheless unjustifiable oversimplification of the nature of the Faith must gradually subside and give way to a deeper realization that the teachings of Baha'u'llah are as an ocean, and all personal capacity is but the vessel that must be refilled again and again. The sum and substance of the faith of Baha'is is not a doctrine, not an organiza-don,  but their acceptance of Baha'u'llah as Manifestation of God. 

 In this acceptance lies the mystery of a unity that is general, not particular, inclusive, not exclusive, and limited in its gradual extension by no boundaries drawn in the social world nor arbitrary limitations accepted by habits formed during generations lacking a true spiritual culture. 

 What the believer learns reverently to be grateful for is a source of wisdom to which he may turn for continuous mental and moral development — a source of truth revealing  a universe in which man's life has valid purpose and assured realization. 

 Human  history begins to reflect the working of a beneficent Providence; the sharp outlines of material sciences gradually fade out in the light of one fundamental science of life; a profounder sociology, connected with the inner life, little by little displaces the superficial economic and political beliefs which like waves dash high an instant oniy to subside into the moveless volume of the sea. 

 ctThe divine reality," tAbdu'1-Bahi has said, "is unthinkable, limitless, eternal, immortal  and invisible. The world of creation is bound by natural law, finite and mortal. The infinite reality cannot be said to ascend or descend. 

 It is beyond the understanding of men, and cannot be described in terms which apply to the phenomenal sphere of the created world. Man, then, is in extreme need of the oniy power by which he is able to receive help from the divine reality, that power alone bringing him into contact with the source of all life. 

 ttAn intermediary is needed to. bring two extremes into relation with each other. Riches and poverty, plenty and need: without an intermediary there could be no relation  between these pairs of opposites. 

 So we can say that there must be a Mediator between God and man, and this is none other than the Holy Spirit, which brings the created earth into relation with the ~Un thinkable One,' the divine reality. 

 The divine reality may be likened to the sun and the Holy Spirit to the rays of the sun. As the rays of the sun bring the light and warmth of the sun to the earth, giving life to all created things, so do the Manifestations bring the power of the Holy Spirit from the divine Sun of Realty to give light and life to the souls of men." 

 In expounding the teachings of Baha'u'llah  to public audiences in the West, tAbdu'1-Bahi frequently encountered the attitude that, while the liberal religionist might well welcome and endorse such tenets, the Baha'i teachings after all bring nothing new, since the principles of Christianity contain all the essentials of spiritual truth. The believer whose heart has been touched by the Faith so perfectly exemplified by tAbdu'1-Bah& feels no desire for controversy, but must needs point out the vital difference between a living faith and a passive formula or doctrine. What religion in its renewal brings is first of all an energy to translate belief into life. This impulse, received into the profoundest depths of consciousness, requires no startling "new-ness" of concept or theory to be appreciated as a gift from the divine world. 

 It carries its own assurance as a renewal of life itself; it is as a candle that has been lighted, and in comparison with the miracle of light the discussion of religion as a form of belief becomes secondary in importance. 

 Were the Baha'i Faith no more than a true revitalization of the revealed truths of former religions, it would by that quickening quality of inner life, that returning to God, still assert itself as the supreme fact of human experience in this age. 

 For religion returns to earth in order to reestablish a standard of spiritual reality. It restores the quality of human existence, its active powers, when that reality has become  overlaid with sterile rites and dogmas which substitute empty shadow for substance. 

 In the person of the Manifestation it destroys all those imitations of religion gradually developed through the centuries

  and summons humanity to the path of sacrifice and devotion. 

 Revelation, moreover, is progressive as well as periodic. Christianity in its original essence not oniy relighted the candle of faith which, in the years since Moses, had become extinguished — it amplified the teachings of Moses with a new dimension which history has seen exemplified in the spread of faith from tribe to nations and peoples. 

 Baha'u'llah  has given religion its world dimension, fulfilling the fundamental purpose of every previous 

Revelation. His Faith      

 stands as the reality within Christianity, within Muhammadanism, within the religion of Moses, the spirit of each, but expressed in teachings which relate to all mankind. 

 The Baha'i Faith, viewed from within, is religion extended from the individual to embrace humanity. It is religion universalized; its teaching for the individual, spiritually identical with the teaching of Christ, supplies the individual with an ethics, a sociology, an ideal of social order, for which humanity in its earlier stages of development was not prepared. Individual fulfilment has been given an objective social standard of reality, balancing the subjective ideal derived from religion in the past. Baha'u'llah has removed the false distinctions  between the "spiritual" and "material" aspects of life, due to which religion has become separate from science, and morality has been divorced from all social activities. The whole arena of human affairs has been brought within the realm of spiritual truth, in the light of the teaching that materialism is not a thing but a motive within the human heart. 

 The Baha'i learns to perceive the universe as a divine creation in which man has his destiny to fulfil under a beneficent Providence whose aims for humanity are made known through Prophets who stand between man and the Creator. He learns his true relation to the degrees and orders of the visible universe; his true relation to God, to himself, to his fellow man, to mankind. The more he studies the Baha'i teachings, the more he becomes imbued with the spirit of unity, the more vividly he perceives the law of unity working in the world today, indirectly manifest in the failure which has overtaken all efforts to organize the principle  of separation and competition, directly manifest in the power which has brought together the followers of Baha'u'llah in East and 'West. He has the assurance that the world's turmoil conceals from worldly minds the blessings long foretold, now forgotten,  in the sayings which prophesied the coming of the Kingdom of God. 

  The Sacred Literature      

 of the Baha'i Faith conveys enlightenment. It inspires life. It frees the mind. 

 It disciplines the heart. For believers, the Word is not a philosophy to be learned, but the sustenance of being throughout the span of mortal existence. 

    'The Baha Faith," Shoghi  

 Effendi stated in a recent letter addressed to a public official, "recognizes the unity of God and of His Prophets, upholds the principle of an unfettered search after truth, condemns all forms of superstition and prejudice, teaches that the fundamental purpose of religion is to promote concord and harmony, that it must go hand-in-hand with science, and that it constitutes the sole and ultimate basis of a peaceful, an ordered and progressive  society. 

 It inculcates the principle of equal opportunity, rights and privileges for both sexes, advocates compulsory education,  abolishes extremes of poverty and wealth, recommends the adoption of an auxiliary international language, and provides the necessary agencies for the establishment and safeguarding of a permanent and universal peace." 

 Those who, even courteously, would dismiss  a Faith so firmly based, will have to admit that, whether or not by their test the teachings of Baha'u'llah are "new," the world's present plight is unprecedented, came without warning save in the utterances  of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu~1~Bahi and day by day draws nearer a climax which strikes terror to the responsible student of current affairs. 

 Humanity itself now seems to share the prison and exile which an unbelieving generation inflicted upon the Glory of God.

  5. A BACKGROUND OF HEROIC SACRIFICE

 ~O My beloved friends! You are the bearers of the name of God in this Day. You have been chosen as the refiositories of His mystery. It behooves each one of you to manifest the attributes of God, and to exemplify by your deeds and words the signs of His righteousness, His power and glory. Ponder the wards of Jesus addressed to His disciples, as He sent them forth to propagate the Cause of GOdY — THE BAn. 

  The words of Baha'u'llah differ in the minds of believers from the words of philosophers  because they have been given substance in the experience of life itself. The history of the Faith stands ever as a guide and commentary upon the meaning and influence of the written text. 

 This history, unfolded contemporaneously  with the rise of science and technology in the NVest, reasserts the providential dement of human existence as it was reasserted  by the spiritual consecration and personal suffering of the prophets and disciples of former times. 

 The world of Jsl~rn one hundred years ago lay in a darkness corresponding to the most degraded epoch of Europe's feudal age. Between the upper and nether millstones of an absolutist state and a materialistic church, the people of IrAn were ground to a condition of extreme poverty and ignorance.  The pomp of the civil and religious courts glittered above the general ruin like firedamp on a rotten log. 

 in that world, however, a few devoted souls stood firm in their conviction that the religion of Mubammad was to be pun-fled  by the rise of a spiritual hero whose coining was assured in their interpretation of His gospel. 

 This remnant of the faithful one by one became conscious chat in tAli-Muhammad, since known to history as the Bib (the ttGate") their hopes had been realized, and under the B&b's inspiration scattered themselves as His apostles to arouse the people and prepare them for the restoration of Isflm to its original integrity. Against the Bib and His followers the whole force of church and state combined to extinguish a fiery zeal which soon threatened to bring their structure of power to the ground. 

 The ministry of the 13kb covered only the six years between 1844 and His martyrdom by a military firing squad in the public square at Tabriz on July 9, 1850. 

 In the BTh's own written message He in. terpreted His mission to be the fulfilment of past religions and the heralding of a world educator and unifier, one who was to come to establish a new cycle. 

 Most of the BTh's chosen disciples, and many thousands of followers, were publicly martyred in towns and villages throughout the country in those years. 

 The seed, however, had been buried too deep in hearts to be extirpated  by any physical instrument of oppression. 

 After the Bib's martyrdom, the weight of official wrath fell upon around whom the Bab's centered their hopes. 

 IIusayn-~A1i was imprisoned in Tihr~n, exiled to Baglidid, from Baghdad sent to Constantinople under the jurisdiction of the SultAn, exiled by the Turkish government to Adrianople, and at length imprisoned in the desolate barracks at tAkk4 In 1863, while delayed outside of Bagh-d~d  for the preparation of the caravan to be dispatched to Constantinople, Ijusayn-tAli established His Cause among the B~bis who insisted upon sharing His exile. 

 His declaration was the origin of the Baha'i Faith in which the BTh's Cause was fulfilled.  The Bab's who accepted ~usayn-~A1i as Baha'u'llah (the Glory of God) were fully conscious that His mission was not a development of the Bab movement but a new Cause for which the Bab had sacrificed His life as the first of those who recognized the manifestation or prophet of the new age. 

 During forty years of exile and imprisonment, Baha'u'llah expounded a gospel which interpreted the spiritual meaning of ancient scriptures, renewed the reality of faith in God and established as the foundation of human society the principle of the oneness  of mankind. 

 This gospel caine into being in the form of letters addressed to individual believers and to groups in


<p12>
12              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  response to questions, in books of religious laws and principles, and in communications transmitted to the kings and rulers calling upon them to establish universal peace. 

 This sacred literature has an authoritative commentary and interpretation in the text of tAbdu'1-Balii's writings during the years between Baha'u'llah's ascension in 1892 and Abdu'l-Baha's departure in 1921, Baha'u'llah having left a testament naming Abdu'l-Baha (His eldest son) as the Interpreter of His Book and the Center of His Covenant. 

 The imprisonment of the Baha'i corn--munity  at tAkk~ ended at last in 1908, when the Young Turks party overthrew the existing political rdgime. 

 For three years prior to the European War, tAbdu'1-BahA, then nearly seventy years of age, journeyed throughout Europe and America, and broadcast in public addresses and innumerable intimate gatherings  the new spirit of brotherhood and world unity penetrating His very being as the consecrated Servant of Baha. The significance of Abdu'l-Baha's commentary and explanation is that it makes mental and moral connection with the thoughts and social conditions of both East and West. Dealing with matters of religious, philosophical,  ethical and sociological nature, tAbdu'1-Bahi expounded all questions in the light of His conviction of the oneness of God and the providential character of human life in this age. 

   The international Baha    

 community, grief-stricken and appalled by its ioss of the wise and loving "Master" in 1921, learned with profound gratitude that tAbdu'1-BahA in a will and testament had provided for the continuance and future development of the Faith. This testament made clear the nature of the Spiritual Assemblies established  in the text of Baha'u'llah and inaugurated a new center for the widespread community of believers in the appointment of 

His grandson, Shoghi       
Effendi, as Guardian      
of the Baha'i Faith.       

 During the fifteen years of general confusion since 1921, the Baha'i community has carried forward the work of internal consolidation and administrative order and has become conscious of its collective responsibility for the promotion of the blessed gospel of Baha'u'llah. In addition to the task of establishing the structure of local and national Spiritual Assemblies, the believers  have translated Baha'i literature into many languages, have sent teachers to all parts of the world, and have resumed construction of the Baha'i House of Worship on the shore of Lake Michigan, near Chicago, the completion of which will be impressive evidence of the power of this new 

Faith.                     

 In the general letters issued to the Baha'i community by Shoghi Effendi in order to execute the provisions of cAbdu~1~Bah2s testament, believers have been given what they are confident is the most profound and accurate analysis of the prevailing social disorder and its true remedy in the World Order of Baha'u'llah.

  HE true progress of the Baha'i world community in recent years has been in its understanding of Baha'u'llah's Faith rather than in numbers or social power. Without this deepened insight into the nature of the Faith, indeed, any considerable advance in the number of adherents might have raised problems an inexperienced and collectively unprepared body of believers would find difficulty in bringing to a solution. 

 The vital importance of this fact appears when it is appreciated to what a degree, at least throughout the 'West, the early believers  unconsciously and instinctively accepted the Baha'i Faith as the "return of Christ." Grasping the Teachings oniy from the aspect of their confirmation of the views entering into a long historical expectation,  the first generation of Baha'is felt themselves living in a spiritual Kingdom such as Jesus created for 

His followers — a Kingdom    

 of the heart and inmost spirit raised high above the perturbations or conquests  of an unbelieving world. The days of Christ, they felt, had been divinely restored; whence their privilege and most sacred duty to live and serve according to the conditions surrounding the ancient Apostles. 

 The fact that Baha'u'llah had not only reestablished the heavenly Kingdom of faith but had vastly extended the scope of religion, the fact that His Teachings fulfilled  expectation not by simple repetition of divine doctrine already revealed but by creating an entirely new dimension for spiritual reality, was not clearly apprehended because the first believers of the West had no other measure of receptivity than their prior religious environment could supply. To be as the early Christians was the standard  of faith they could not but adopt and seek to apply. True, the concept ttBah&'i" was not limited to adherents of Christian descent. 

 True, the new term applied equally to believers of Mubammad or Buddha as to Christians and Jews. The values associated with the Faith, nevertheless, were inherently restricted to those created for mankind in the Sermon on the Mount. 

 The difference between the mission of Christ and Baha'u'llah they acknowledged, but instinctively held it to be limited only by the fact that now the sacred doctrine  could at last be promulgated throughout  the earth and not confined to one area like the ancient empire of Rome. 

 A world in dire torment, even though it had prepared a great host to accept the tcreturn of Christ" and replace with the high challenge of the Sermon on the Mount a social culture obviously unfit to deal with the problems of a society fatally divided and in decline, could not but have overrun and even repudiated the claim of a Faith whose application to social problems was as simple and naive as the outlook of the Baha community in the West long considered  it to be. That raith, however, serene and potent in its full reality and implication, has possessed the force necessary  to reeducate the Baha'is themselves, and moreover, to express its fundamental character and aim so clearly and vigorously that the Baha'i Teachings today constitute the essence of statesmanship and sociology, 13

14              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  demonstrating their new and supreme mis-non  by creating a World Order even within the ruins of a civilization impotent to survive. 

 It has been in the successive general corn —  munications issued by its Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, since early in 1929, that the whole significance and integrity of Baha'u'llah's Revelation has been made apparent. 

 The unique virtue of these letters — in reality a series of statements interpreting the Teachings  in the light of the decadent world and the condition of the world in the light of the Teachings — has been their power to convey, not for the instruction or solace of individual seekers, but for the guidance of an international community, that spiritual truth given this age in measure greater than could be poured forth by the Manifestation at any prior epoch. The 

Message of Baha'i  '11Th 

 can now be apprehended in its fulness and majesty and by its own supernal light, not dimmed by reflection from minds historically limited, no matter bow sincere and devoted the hearts they turned to 

Him.                       

 The faith of Baha'is, thanks to ths interpretation and guidance, has been assimilated into an understanding no longer subject to challenge of world problem and international  condition unresponsive to that lesser spiritual truth intended for the regeneration of the individual alone. 

 As an inner experience, faith is ever complete and perfect within itself, for the individual  who rises to the station of faith becomes filled with a holy elixir so penetrating  that no capacity for doubt remains. The experience seems not merely immune from critical attack but of a nature higher than criticism can ever understand. 

 Nothing  within the individual's destiny, when his faith is real, ever serves to challenge its per-Lea integrity or demonstrate its incapacity to meet any and every condition the person can possibly undergo. His sole regret is that others are not similarly inspired and equally blessed. 

 The movements of society as a whole, however, supply a historical perspective larger than the individual's range of personal  experience. 

 The religion entirely perfect  to the devotee can, and has throughout recorded time, failed to transmute psychological logical truth into a sociological equivalent, or personal values into the principles of a spiritual community. 

 From ecstasy of redemption to grandeur of martyrdom, the individual treads his own path acclaiming the omnipotence of God. But ten thousand inspired martyrs do not together constitute the elements of a public policy capable of removing the causes of poverty or extirpating the seeds of disastrous war. Personal ecstasy, no matter how pure and enduring a light in the soui, is not equivalent to the function of statesmanship in replacing with order the fundamental disorder of a divided world. 

 Humanity throughout the ages has been confused by the continuous division yawning  between personal spirituality and social necessity, with the result that all expectation  of the fulfilment of truth has been turned to another tthigher" world or has depicted an earthly consummation as naive as the imagination of a child. The interval of time ever separating the flower of faith from its perfect fruit has darkened the vision  of innumerable generations of loyal believers,  making their convictions irrational and socially ineffective, and opening the door to constant compromise with the pressures  exerted by the movements of society as a whole. The distance between spiritual reality and the organic structure of civilization  has been a wasteland within which churches and states alike have perished in every previous age. Every theology and every sociology laboriously devised to carry mankind safely from the realm of personal motive to the realm of an organically united and harmonious civilization has served oniy to reemphasize the vital fact that the task lies beyond human capacity to perform. 
    The larger meaning of      

Baha'u'llah's Revelation   

 conveyed by Shoghi Effendi is that God has destined this age to take the step from subjective experience to world order. The new dimension of truth revealed by Baha'u'llah lies in the divine civilization His Word created upon earth. The Baha'i community no longer recognizes the wasteland; the reality it has accepted includes an organic  social structure as well as a Sermon on the Mount. The faith of the believer combines knowledge of a world community

  with knowledge of the holy path he, as an individual, must tread if he would be loyal to his Lord. 

 The effect of the Guardian's successive statements has been to suppiy the Baha'i community with an impregnable foundation at the very time that the world is most grievously shaken and its truths and institutions  made a source of bitter disillusion to discerning men. As Shoghi Effendi's insight  has renewed and developed the consciousness  of the believers, it has become apparent to them that the world crisis, far from challenging their loyalty, confirms it with proofs and evidence so tangible that not for long will the confirmation stand hidden from the intelligence and groping spirit of a bewildered race. For as the nations  recoil under blows of a destiny they were not formed to encounter or even estimate,  the Baha'i community grows ever more conscious of the Power by which its human weakness is sustained, and more aware that its collective experience has mysteriously  been to trace the outline and pattern  of the emerging world. 

 Nothing could so effectively disclose the forces working throughout the Baha'i world during the past two years as the fol-. lowing excerpts from the Guardian's letters, chosen because they appear to concentrate upon the aspect of the Revelation which extends  religion into that new dimension so vitally needed by mankind today. 

 cdt would be helpful and instructive  to bear in mind certain basic principles with reference to the Will and Testament ~f Abdu'l-Baha which, together with the Kitab-i-Aqdas, constitutes the chief depositary  wherein are enshrined those priceless elements of that Divine Civilization, the establishment  of which is the primary mission of the Baha'i Faith. 

 "To dissociate the administrative principles  of the Cause from the purely spiritual and humanitarian teachings would be tantamount  to a mutilation of the body of the Cause, a separation that can only result in the disintegration of its component parts, and the extinction of the Faith itself. 

That the Spiritual Assemblies

 of today will be replaced in time by the Houses of Justice,  and are to all intents and purposes iden tical and not separate bodies, is abundantly confirmed by ~Abdu'1Ba1A Himself. 

 Not only will the presentday Spiritual Assemblies  be styled differently in future, but will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives  necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power. And as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's future superstate. 

 ctWho, I may ask, when viewing the international character of the Cause, its far-flung ramifications, the increasing complexity of its affairs, the diversity of its adherents, and the state of confusion that assails on every side the infant Faith of God, can for a moment question the neces-sky of some sort of administrative machinery  that will insure, amid the storm and stress of a struggling civilization, the unity of the Faith, the preservation of its identity, and the protection of its interests?" — Feb-mary 27, 1929. 

 ~ cannot refrain from appealing to them who stand identified with the Faith to disregard the prevailing notions and the fleeting  fashions of the day, and to realize as never before that the exploded theories and the tottering institutions of presentday civilization must needs appear in sharp contrast  with those God-given institutions which are destined to arise upon their ruin. 

 "For Baha'u'llah has not only imbued  mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit.

<p17>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES              17

  down a set of Laws, established definite institutions, and provided for the essentials of a Divine Economy. These are destined to be a pattern for future society, a supreme instrument for the establishment of the Most Great Peace, and the one agency for the unification of the world, and the proclamation of the reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth. 

   "Unlike the Dispensation   

 of Christ, unlike  the Dispensation of Mubammad, unlike all the Dispensations of the past, the apos-ties of Baha'u'llah in every land, wherever they labor and toil, have before them in clear, in unequivocal and emphatic language, all the laws, the regulations, the principles, the institutions, the guidance, they require for the prosecution of their task. Therein lies the distinguishing feature of the Baha'i Revelation. 

 Therein lies the strength of the unity of the Faith, of the validity of a Revelation that claims not to destroy or belittle previous Revelations,  but to connect, unify, and fulfil them. 

 rtFeeble though our Faith may now appear  in the eyes of men, who either de-flounce  it as an offshoot of Islim, or contemptuously ignore it as one more of those obscure sects that abound in the West, this priceless gem of Divine Revelation, now still in its embryonic state, shall evolve within the shell of His law, and shall forge ahead, undivided and unimpaired, till it embraces  the whole of mankind. Only those who have already recognized the supreme station of Baha'u'llah, only those whose hearts have been touched by His love, and have become familiar with the potency of His spirit, can adequately appreciate the value of this Divine Economy — His inestimable  gift to mankind." — March 21, 1930. 

 ttTen years of unceasing turmoil, so laden with anguish, so fraught with incalculable consequences to the future of civilization, have brought the world to the verge of a calamity too awful to contemplate. 

 Such has been the cumulative effect of these successive crises, following one another with such bewildering rapidity, that the very foundations of society are trembling. 

 The world, to whichever continent we turn our gaze, to however remote a region our survey may extend, is everywhere assailed by forces it can neither explain nor control. 

 "Might we not already discern, as we scan the political horizon, the alignment of those forces that are dividing afresh the continent of Europe into camps of potential combatants, determined upon a contest that may mark, unlike the last war, the end of an epoch, a vast epoch, in the history of human evolution? Might not the bankruptcy of this present, this highly-vaunted materialistic civilization, in itself clear away the choking weeds that now hinder  the unfoldment and future efflorescence of 

God's struggling Faith?    

 ttHumanity whether viewed in the light of man's individual conduct or in the existing  relationships between organized communities and nations, has, alas, strayed too far and suffered too great a decline to be redeemed  through the unaided efforts of the best among its recognized rulers and statesmen  — however disinterested their motives, however concerted their action, however unsparing in their zeal and devotion to its cause. No scheme which the calculations of the highest statesmanship may yet devise;  no doctrine which the most distinguished exponents of economic theory may hope to advance; no principle which the most ardent of moralists may strive to inculcate, can provide, in the last resort, adequate  foundations upon which the future of a distracted world can be built. 

 "It is towards this goal — the goal of a new World Order, Divine in origin, all-embracing in scope, equitable in principle, challenging in its features — that a harassed humanity must strive. 

 C(HOW pathetic indeed are the efforts of those leaders of human institutions who, in utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are striving to adjust national processes, suited to the ancient days of selfcontained nations,  to an age which must either achieve the unity of the world, as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah, or perish. At so critical an hour in the history of civilization it behooves the leaders of all the nations of the world, great and small, whether in the East or in the West, whether victors or vanquished,  to give heed to the clarion call of

18              THE  BAHA'I WORLD

  Baha'u'llah and, thoroughly imbued with a sense of world solidarity, the sine qud non of loyalty to His Cause, arise manfully to carry out in its entirety the one remedial scheme I-lie, the Divine Physician, has prescribed  for an ailing humanity. Let them discard, once for all, every preconceived idea, every national prejudice, and give heed to the sublime counsel of tAbdu~1~BaM, the authorized Expounder of His teachings. ~You can best serve your country,' was tAbdu'1-Bah6t rejoinder' to a high official in the service of the federal government of the United States of America, who had questioned Him as to the best manner in which he could promote the interests of his government and people, 7/ you strive, in your capacity as a citizen of the world, to assist in the eventual application of the principle of federalism underlying the government  of your own country to the relationships now existing between the peoples and nations of the world.' 

 ttSome form of a world Super-State must needs be evolved, in whose favor all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining  internal order within their respective dominions. 

 Such a state will have to include  within its orbit an International Executive  adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the commonwealth; a World Parliament whose members shall be elected by the people in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; and a Supreme  Tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect even in such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit their case to its consideration. 

 A world community in which all economic  barriers will have been permanently demolished and the interdependence of Capital  and Labor definitely recognized; in which the clamor of religious fanaticism and strife will have been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of international law — the prod-'In  the year 1912. 

 uct of the considered judgment of the world's federated representatives — shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive intervention  of the combined forces of the federated units; and finally a world community  in which the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world citizenship — such indeed, appears, in its broadest outline, the Order anticipated by Baha'u'llah, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the fairest fruit of a slowly maturing age. 

 ccLet there be no misgivings as to the animating  purpose of the worldwide Law of Baha'u'llah. Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it seeks to broaden its basis, to remould  its institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an everchanging world. It can conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men's hearts, nor-to  abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language and tradition,  of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration  than any that has animated the human race. 

 tIThe call of Baha'u'llah is primarily directed against all forms of provincialism, all insularities and prejudices      For legal standards, political and economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any particular law or doctrine. 

 The principle of the Oneness  of Mankind — the pivot round which all the teachings of Baha'u'llah revolve — is no mere outburst of ignorant emotionalism or an expression of vague and pious hope. 

 •Its implications are deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of old were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable not only to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of


<p19>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             19

  those essential relationships that must bind all the states and nations as members of one human family. 

 cdt represents the consummation of human  evolution. 

 "That the forces of a world catastrophe can alone precipitate such a new phase of human thought is, alas, becoming increasingly  apparent. 

 Nothing but a fiery ordeal, out of which humanity will emerge, chastened and prepared, can succeed in implanting  that sense of responsibility which the leaders of a newborn age must arise to shoulder. 

 Has not cAbdu~1~Bah4 Himself asserted in unequivocal language that eanot her war, fiercer than the last, will assuredly break out' ?" — Novernber 2 8, 4931. 

 "That a Faith which, ten years ago, was severely shaken by the sudden removal of an incomparable Master 1 should have, in the face of tremendous obstacles, maintained  its unity, resisted the malignant onslaught  of its ill-wishers, silenced its calumniators, broadened the basis of its far-flung  administration, and raised upon it institutions symbolizing its ideals of worship  and service, should be deemed sufficient evidence of the invincible power with which the Almighty has chosen to inyest it from the moment of its inception. 

 ttThat the Cause associated with the name of Baha'u'llah feeds itself upon those hidden springs of celestial strength which no force of human personality, whatever its glamor, can replace; that its reliance is solely upon that mystic Source with which no worldly advantage, be it wealth, fame or learning, can compare; that it propagates itself by ways mysteriously and utterly at variance with the standards accepted by the generality of mankind, will become increasingly manifest as it forges ahead towards fresh conquests in its struggle for the spiritual regeneration of mankind. 

 ccFew are even dimly aware of the preponderating r6le which the North American continent is destined to play in the future orientation of their world-embracing Cause.:

 in the eyes of the one true God, the land wherein the splendors of His light shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide, and the free assemble.' 

 t~The Revelation, of which Baha'u'llah is the source and center, abrogates none of the 'religions which have preceded it, nor does it attempt, in the slightest degree, to distort their features or to belittle their value. 

 It disclaims any intention of dwarfing any of the Prophets of the past, or of whittling down the eternal verity of Their teachings. It can, in no wise, conflict with the spirit that animates Their claims, nor does it seek to undermine the basis of any man's allegiance  to Their cause. Its declared, its primary purpose, is to enable every adherent of these Faiths to obtain a fuller understanding of the religion with which he stands identified, and to acquire a clearer apprehension of its purpose. It is neither eclectic in the presentation of its truths, nor arrogant in the affirmation of its claims. Its teachings revolve around the fundamental principle that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation  is progressive, not final. Unequivocally and without the least reservation it proclaims  all established religions to be divine in origin, identical in their aims, complementary  in their functions, continuous in their purpose, indispensable in their value to mankind. 

 "Those who have recognized the Light of God in this age claim no finality for the Revelation with which they stand identified, nor arrogate to the Faith they have embraced  powers and attributes intrinsically superior to, or essentially different from, those which have characterized any of the religious systems that preceded it. tt'Who contemplating the helplessness, the fears and miseries of humanity in this day, can any longer question the necessity for a fresh revelation of the quickening power of God's redemptive love and guidance? Who can be so blind as to doubt that the hour has at last struck for the advent of a new Revelation, for a restatement of the Divine Purpose, and for the consequent revival of those spiritual forces that have, at fixed intervals, rehabilitated the fortunes of human society? Does not the very

  operation of the world-unifying forces that are at work in this age necessitate that He Who is the Bearer of the Message of God in this day should not only reaffirm that selfsame exalted standard of individual conduct  inculcated by the Prophets gone before Him, but embody in His appeal, to all governments and peoples, the essentials of that social code, that Divine Economy, which must guide humanity's concerted efforts in establishing that all-embracing federation which is to signalize the advent  of the Kingdom of God on this earth? 

 ~     feel it incumbent to stress the importance of an instruction which should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or to the West. 

 This principle is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah,  whether in their individual capacities or collectively as local or national (Spir-itual) Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 Such an attitude indicates the desire cherished by every true and loyal follower of Baha'u'llah to serve, in an unselfish,  unostentatious and patriotic fashion, the highest interests of the country to which he belongs, and in a way that would entail no departure from the high standards of integrity and truthfulness associated  with the teachings of his Faith."

 ~May this American democracy,' He Himself,' while in America, was heard to remark, Cbe the first nation to establish the foundation of international agreement. May it be the first nation to proclaim the unity of mankind. May America become  the distributing center of spiritual enlightenment and all the world receive this heavenly blessing.' — April 21, 1933. 

   "This Administrative Order

 will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not oniy as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New 1 Abdu'l-Baha visited North America in 1912. 

 World Order destined to embrace in the fulness of time the whole of mankind. 

 (tAlone of all the Revelations gone before it this Faith has succeeded in raising a structure which the bewildered followers of bankrupt and broken creeds might well approach and critically examine, and seek, ere it is too late, the invulnerable security of its world-embracing shelter. 

 CCTO what else if not to the power and majesty which this Administrative Order —  the rudiments of the future all-enfolding Baha'i Commonwealth — is destined to manifest, can these utterances of Baha'u'llah allude: The world's equilibrium bath been ufiset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind's ordered life bath been revolutionized  through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed.' 

 ttThe Baha'i Commonwealth of the future, of which this vast Administrative Order is the sole framework, is, both in theory and practice, not oniy unique in the entire history of political institutions, but can find no parallel in the annals of any of the world's recognized religious systems. No form of democratic government; no system of autocracy or of dictatorship, whether monarchical or republican; no intermediary  scheme of a purely aristocratic order; nor even any of the recognized types of theocracy, whether it be the Hebrew Commonwealth, or the various Christian ecclesiastical organizations, or the Imamate or the Caliphate in bUm — none of these can be identified or said to conform with the Administrative Order which the master-hand of its perfect Architect has fashioned. 

 !cLet no one, while this System is still in its infancy, belittle its significance or misrepresent its purpose. The bedrock on which this Administrative Order is founded is God's immutable Purpose for mankind in this day. The Source from which it derives its inspiration is no one less than Baha'u'llah Himself. The central, the underlying aim which animates it is the establishment of the New World Order as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah. 

 The methods it employs, the standard it inculcates, in

  dine it to neither East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor poor, neither white nor colored. Its watchword is the unification of the human race; its standard the CMost Great Peace. 
February 8, 1934.         

 "The contrast between the accumulating evidences of steady consolidation that accompany  the rise of the Administrative Order of the Faith of God, and the forces of disintegration which batter at the fabric of a travailing society, is as clear as it is arresting. 

 Both within and outside the Baha'i world the signs and tokens which, in a mysterious manner, are heralding the birth of that World Order, the establishment  of which must signalize the Golden Age of the Cause of God, are growing and multiplying day by day. 

   CC !~~fl Baha'u'llah's     

 own words proclaim  it, ~1.vilI the presentday Order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead.' 

    "The Revelation of Baha'u'llah

 should be regarded as signalizing through its advent the coining of age of the entire human race. It should be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the everchanging fortunes of mankind, not only as a further stage in a chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man's collective life on this planet. The emergence of a world corn. munity, the consciousness of world citizenship,  the founding of a world civilization and culture should be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the furthermost limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an individual,  will, nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation, continue indefinitely to progress and develop. 

  "The successive Founders  

 of all past Religions Who have shed, with ever-increasing intensity, the splendor of one common Revelation at the various stages which have marked the advance of mankind towards maturity may thus be regarded as preliminary Manifestations, anticipating  and paving the way for the advent of that Day of Days when the whole earth will have fructified and the tree of humanity  will have yielded its destined fruit. 

 "Beset on every side by the cumulative evidences of disintegration, of turmoil and of bankruptcy, serious-minded men and women, in almost every walk of life, are beginning to doubt whether society, as it is now organized, can, through its unaided efforts, extricate itself from the slough into which it is steadily sinking. 

 Every system, short of the unification of the human race, has been tried, repeatedly tried, and been found wanting. Yet crisis has succeeded crisis, and the rapidity with which a perilously unstable world is declining has been correspondingly accelerated. 

 "Who else can be blissful if not the community of the Most Great Name,1 whose world-embracing, continually consolidating activities constitute the one integrating process in a world whose institutions, secular  as well as religious, are for the most part dissolving? 

 Of alithe kindreds of the earth they alone can recognize, amidst the welter of a tempestuous age, the Hand of the Divine Redeemer that traces its course and controls its destinies. They alone are aware of the silent growth of that orderly world polity whose fabric they themselves arc weaving. 

 CCCeasing to designate itself a movement, a fellowship and the like — designations that did grave injustice to its ever-unfolding system — dissociating itself from such appellations as Bab sect, Asiatic cult, and offshoot  of Shitih Isl4m, with which the ignorant and the malicious were wont to describe it, refusing to be labeled as a mere philosophy of life, or as an eclectic code of ethical conduct, or even as a new religion, the Faith of Baha'u'llah is now visibly succeeding in demonstrating its claim and title to be regarded as a World Religion, destined to attain the status of a world-embracing Commonwealth, which would be at once the instrument and the guardian of the Most Great Peace announced  by its Author.

    FORMATION OF TWO NATIONAL SPIRITUAL
ASSEMBLIES                 

  The pillars of the Baha'i world order are the National Spiritual Assemblies, elected by delegates representing the local Baha'i communities within the designated area of jurisdiction. 

A National Spiritual       

 Assembly cannot be constituted until the Faith has become sufficiently widespread and firmly rooted to provide support for the national administrative body, whose effectiveness depends  upon the existence of experienced local Spiritual 

Assemblies.                

 The present period has been notable in the formation of two more National Assemblies, one by the Baha'is of Thin, the other by the 

Baha'is of Australia       

 and New Zealand. It would be difficult to find evidence  more convincingly testifying to the universality of the Cause of Baha'u'llah than this development made possible by believers so separated not merely by distance but by race, culture and historical experience.  IrAn, with its ancient memories of a power and glory antedating the civilization  of Europe, and its complex spirit impregnated with the influence of successive religions, stands in striking contrast to Australia and New Zealand, lands still marked by the stage of the pioneer and in their social progress akin to the North America existing in the middle of the nineteenth  century. 

 By faith, however, and the supreme power of a Teaching shaped for humanity and not one race or country alone, the Baha'is of these two diverse regions have entered upon a path of oneness which they tread in a unity of purpose and an intimacy of soul greater than that of members  of the same family whose physical bond has no true spiritual substance and reinforcement. 

   The first Annual Convention

 of the Babi'is of fran was held at Tihr~n during eight days commencing April 26, 1934. As in North America, ninety-five delegates had been assigned proportionately to the national community, and of these eighty-one were present at the first session, eighty-four at the later sessions. This event of vital importance  is told in detail in the Report prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly of Inn and published as a supplement to this Survey. 

 From the point of view of the Baha'i world community, it is significant to note that both the National Assembly of IrAn and that of Australia and New Zealand were formed and are functioning in strict conformity with the administrative principles  controlling the national Baha'i institutions previously established in other lands. Their constitutional character and their organic processes are identical with those of America, Europe and other Baha'i communities throughout the East, with the result that a believer can take residence in any established national Baha'i community and find his spiritual citizenship completely unchanged. 

 Such differences as he would encounter in the realm of detail, even as the obvious distinctions of language and ciii-tural background, but fulfil the true


<p23>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             23

  spiritual unity by stressing that diversity on which true unity must be based. 

 On account of the vast Baha'i popula-don  of inn, the ninety-five delegates were elected proportionately by the believers through twenty administrative divisions rather than through their separate local Baha'i communities. 

 It would be impossible, clearly, to assign ninety-five delegates to local communities numbering more than five hundred. The principle underlying national Baha'i elections, nevertheless, was fully observed. A similar method of administrative districts including numbers of local Baha communities will have to be developed for America and other nations when the number of their Spiritual Assemblies exceeds the number of the delegates the believers collectively are to elect. 

 The Baha'i affairs of Iran had previously been directed and coordinated nationally by the former "Central Assembly" at 

Tihr~n. The first National

 Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of IrAn were: Valiyu'llih Kbiin VarqA, Shuca~u~11Ah Kh~in cA1i~i, 

Dr. Ytinis KMn Afr4khtih  
Jinib-i-F~di1-i-MAzin-darAni, 

Amin-Arnin, Ahncrnd Kh4n  
Yaz-dAni,  'Ali-Akbar KhTh

 rurtnan, t1n~yatu-'11Th Khin Ahrnadpiir, and 

Mahmtid KhAn Badi'i.      
    The first Annual Convention

 of the Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand was held at Sydney, May 15, 16, 17 and 18, 1934. Details of this meeting, so significant in the unfoldment of the Baha world order, are made availabit in reports issued by the 

National Spiritual Assembly
formed by that Convention.

 CCA little more than a decade after the landing in Sydney of those two indefatigable  Baha'i pioneers, Mr. and Mrs. Hyde Dunn, has seen the outward and visible consummation of their labors in the formation  of a National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Commonwealth of Australia  and the 

Dominion of New Zealand. This

 was the outstanding achievement of the Cause in these southern lands in 1934, and itself bears witness to the sincerity, enthusiasm and faith of the believers. 
  ttflah&'is from Adelaide, 

Melbourne, New Zealand    

 and other places met in Sydney where the first Baha'i Convention was held. 

 ft was a wonderful experience in cooperative  effort and a powerful means of spiritual attraction. 

 A reporter from the Sydney C Sun' attended the opening session and an outline of the Baha'i Principles appeared in the next issue of that newspaper. 

 ~~This first Convention was of historic importance to the Baha'i Cause in that it was for the purpose of forming a National Spiritual Assembly for this southern continent,  and so becoming another link in the chain for the establishment of the future International 

House of Justice.         

 (cThe New Zealand delegates were the first to arrive, and a special meeting of we1-come  was arranged at which a happy time was spent in contacting the 

Sydney friends. Later     

 in the week the Adelaide delegates, and friends from both Melbourne and Adelaide, arrived, and these received a similar warmhearted welcome, so that before the Convention opened a feeling of true Baha'i friendliness and fellowship was established, and all were filled with an anticipatory joy in being privileged to take part in such a momentous event. 

 ttThe elected delegates were: —  c(New Zealand — Mrs. Emily M. Axford, Miss Margaret B. Stevenson, Miss Ethel A. Blundell. 

 ttAdelaide — Mrs. Silver Jackman, Miss Hilda Brooks, Mr. Robert Brown. 

 "Sydney — Mrs. Routh, Mr. Hyde Dunn, Mr. 0. Whittaker." 

 Significant as the formation of a new National Spiritual Assembly is as evidence of an active, vigorous and widespread Baha'i community in its land, its full importance  lies in the fact that the institution of the National Assembly itself is but a step in the development of the Baha'i world order. A National Spiritual Assembly stands not as an independent body, nor a final authority in the realm of collective action, but as the pillar upon which will rest in future the dome of the Baha'i social structure — the International House of Justice. A great part of the necessary foundation for that crowning Baha'i achievement has already been constructed. It remains oniy for the new National Spiritual Assemblies to begin functioning with effective power, and for the Baha'i corn

  munities in Caucasus and Turkist~n to be enabled to initiate their own Annual Convention  and form National Spiritual Assemblies.  The requisite capacity will then have been acquired, and the proper conditions  realized, for the decisive final step upon which the world's peace and even its very existence depends. 
                          
INCORPORATION OF EXISTING 
    NATIONAL SPIRITUAL        
        ASSEMBLIES                

  During the same period, also, the National Spiritual Assemblies of Egypt, and of India and Burma, found it possible to effect legal incorporation and secure official state recognition for their national Baha'i constitution. 

Moreover, the National    
Assemblies  of Germany   

 and tlriq took steps to adopt constitutions and bylaws identical with the Declaration of Trust under which the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada has operated for some ten years. The text of these constitutions, some of which are accompanied by the certificate issued to them by the civil authorities, is reproduced in Part Two of the present work. 

 Not less interesting is the fact that the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and Burma has in addition formed a Palestine Branch, duly incorporated and registered, similar to that formed some years ago by the American Assembly, thus adding one more Baha'i national community empowered to hold title to land at the world center of the 

Faith.                    

 The amount of land transferred to the Palestine Branch of the American Assembly during this period, adjacent to the Shrine of the Bib on Mount Carmel, has been very considerable. 

 Part was acquired by purchase  from funds contributed directly for that purpose by believers, the balance consisting  of individual holdings donated by their Baha'i owners. In this connection it is of interest to recall the fact that American  Baha'is were advised by Abdu'l-Baha many years before Haifa possessed any importance and before Palestine even had been awakened from its slumber of ages to purchase lots on Mount Carmel! The Palestine Branch of the American Assembly, at the date of this writing, owns in both cAkk~ and Haifa, approximately sixty thousand square pics — one thousand, six hundred square pics being equivalent to nine hundred square meters. The holdings thus represent some thirty-three thousand, seven hundred and fifty square meters. 

 Soon after its incorporation in the Mixed Court of 

Egypt, the National Spiritual Assembly

 of that land acquired, through donation from an Egyptian Baha'i, one faddan of land, equal to four thousand square meters. 

 The incorporation of the National Assembly  of the Baha'is of Egypt must be regarded as far more than a legal achievement. 

 The first Assembly to secure civil recognition and the status of an independent  religion in Islim, the National Spiritual Assembly has succeeded in this effort only after a long and ardent struggle. Within a decade, the Baha'is of Egypt have progressed from a status officially regarded as one of heresy in the eyes of Mu]2ammad-anism to that of spiritual independence. The Westerner can not appreciate, nor scarcely imagine, the degree of progress this evolution represents. It is equivalent to the transition from the tenth to the nineteenth century in the West. 
                          
 BAHA'I PROPERTY IN AMERICA

  From 1909, the date when American Baha'is made their first purchase of land as the site of the House of Worship on Lake Michigan, near Chicago, to 1936, the amount of Baha'i property greatly in —  creased. 

 Five separate properties are now legally held for the benefit of the National Spiritual  Assembly of American Baha'is: the land and structure of the House of Worship,  with caretaker's cottage and the studio constructed by the Temple architect, the late Louis J. Bourgeois; Green Acre, Eliot, Maine, the site of the Conferences founded by the late Sarah J. Farmer in 1894, consisting of an Inn, five cottages, 

Fellowship House and Arts 

 and Crafts Studio, with several parcels of land — including the important  holding on Mount Salvat — totaling


<p25>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES              25

  several hundred acres; the house at Maiden, Massachusetts, blessed by the time spent in it by tAbdu'1-Bahi during His American journey in 1912; the land and buildings developed  by 

Roy C. Wilhelm at West     

 Englewood,  New Jersey, chosen by 'Abdu'l-Baha as the place for the Unity Feast He gave the Baha'is of the New York metropolitan district in June, 1912, and now used as the Office of the National Assembly and the meeting place of the local Baha'i community; and the property at Geyserville, California, which Mr. and Mrs. John Bosch for about seven years placed at the disposal of the Summer School maintained by the Baha'is of the 

Pacific Coast.             

 Green Acre was transferred to Baha'i trustees by the Green Acre Fdlowship which held title after Sarah J. Farmer's death. The Maiden house was left to Shoghi Effendi in the Will and Testament of the late Maria P. Wilson, and by Shoghi Effendi transferred to Baha'i trustees. Both the Wilhelm and Bosch properties were received  as donations by their respective owners. 

 While values may not be readily established  for all these holdings, the entire property held for the Baha'i Faith in America can be estimated as amounting in worth to at least one million, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 

 By far the greater portion of this value has been created  by the Baha'is during the decade beginning 1926. 
                           
   DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN       

  The formation of a National Spiritual Assembly by the believers of lMn made possible the undertaking of larger Baha'i enterprises but at the same time this step seemed challenged by a new and violent anti-BaM'i attitude on the part of certain government departments. 

 Of intense interest to Baha'is of other nations has been the acquisition, by purchase,  of a portion of the village of Chihriq, where the Bab was incarcerated. 

 This sacred and revered scene of one of the momentous episodes in the history of the Faith has thus come under the care and protection  of the Cause. 

 Various other sacred and historic sites associated with the Founders of the Faith in fr6n, and hallowed by the heroism of Their early followers, are likewise being gradually acquired, in accordance with a definite plan adopted under the advice of the Guardian and assisted by his contribution  in the amount of two thousand ff1-mans  a year. 

 At the same time, progress has been made in the construction of the Haziratu'1-Quds, or Baha headquarters, in the capital city, TihrAn. 

 A vast area, moreover, has been acquired on the slopes of Mount Alburz, northeast of Tilirin, for the eventual construction of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar (House of Worship) by the Baha'is of tr&n. The land already acquired measures not less than one million, two hundred and fifty-seven thousand square meters, but is being extended by further purchases in order to provide sufficient space for the erection of the accessory  buildings, or dependencies, which with the House of Worship constitute the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar established by Baha'u'llah. 

 The Report of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of I r~n which follows this International review testifies to the further progress of the Faith in that land, and the activities maintained under the direction of national Committees. 

 Brief reference may be made here to the formation of a National Baha'i Archives, the dispatching of accredited teachers to 'IrAq as well as to many parts of frAn, the adoption of Baha'i marriage certificates and also a Baha'i certificate of divorce, the dissemination of Baha'i news to local centers, and the necessity of meeting the dire and widespread difficulties resulting from repressive  measures adopted by the civil authorities. 

 The weakening of the power of the Muslim  clergy in I r~n has been an indication of nationalism rather than a broadening and deepening of the basis of social ethics and of spiritual religion. A necessary step toward the eventual triumph of a World Faith, the decline of IslAm as revealed religion  and ecclesiastical authority has at first resulted in a social environment hostile


<p26>
26              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  to the claims of divine truth. The condition, giving as it does an undue influence to secular forces, exposes the followers of a living Faith to the increase of pressure and tension which invariably accompanies the discrediting of traditional religion. In his letter on t~The Unfoldment of World Civilization"  dated March 11, 1936, Shoghi Effendi thus describes that decline: (cThe collapse of the Shitih hierarchy, in a land which had for centuries been one of the impregnable strongholds of Muslim fanaticism, was the inevitable consequence of that wave of secularization which, at a later time, was to invade some of the most powerful and conservative institutions in both the 

European and American      

 continents.  Though not the direct outcome of the last war, this sudden trembling which had seized this hitherto immovable pillar of IsUmic orthodoxy accentuated the problems and deepened the restlessness with which a war-weary world was being afflicted. Shi'ih IslAm had lost once for all, in Baha'u'llah's  native land and as the direct consequence  of its implacable hostility to His Faith, its combative power, had forfeited its rights and privileges, had been degraded and demoralized, and was being condemned to hopeless obscurity and ultimate extinction.~~ With startling suddenness, and wholly unexpectedly to the Baha'is of the West, the famous Tarbiyat Schools in Tihr~n were compelled to close their doors and abandon their historic mission of initiating true education in Iran. School after school, throughout the country, conducted by Baha'is in cities, towns and villages, cherished by them and of incalculable benefit to thousands of innocent children and youth, incurred the same penalty by order of the Department of Education. At the same time those disabilities described in previous volumes of The Baha'i World were maintained and in some ways extended and made more rigorous. 
    The account given by the   

National Spiritual  Assembly

 of Iran, in its Report already mentioned, may be amplified by the following excerpts from other communications. 

 ttAS the Board of Education had formerly warned the Tarbiyat Schools officially that in case these schools are closed on unofficial holidays, orders will be issued for the closing up of same, the National Spiritual Assembly  here with a view to preventing the occurrence of such an event and pointing out to the authorities concerned the importance  which such an action would involve, deputed one of its members, Dr. 

Youness KMn Afroukhteh     

 to call on H. E. Mirza tAli Aghar KMn Hekmat, the acting Minister of Education with instructions that he (Dr. Youness KhAn) should explain fully the matter to the acting Minister. Dr. Youness KMn, in the course of the interview which he had with this official, made it clear to him that as the Tarbiyat Schools formed part of private institutions of the Baha'i community and as the teachers and pupils are chiefly Baha'i and that since these teachers and pupils, as one of their religious duties, abstain from working  on nine days during the year, the schools are automatically closed, and that as this is a matter relating to the religious belief of the Baha'is, it is impossible for the Assembly to interfere with sacred duties of the Baha'i individuals by forcing them to work in the Baha'i holidays. 

 Dr. Youness KhAn also made it clear in the course of his conversations, that in the same way that the Board of Education allows the Jewish, Zoroastrian and Christian communities in this country to celebrate their religious holidays, the Baha'is should equally be permitted  to benefit by their religious legitimate right. The acting Minister had considered such a matter to be against the regulations of his Department and had stated that the Baha'is should not, at any rate, close their schools on these days and suggested that the schools should be left open more or less on these days, failing which he would have no alternative but to take action for the closing of the schools by virtue of a notification which would be issued from the Board of Education. 

 The reason given by His Excellency Hekmat was that the Iranian Government has not recognized the Baha'i religion as it has other minority religions. 

 Dr. Youness Kh&n again called on the acting Minister for the third time and took with him Mirza 'Au Akbar Khan Foroutan, the Principal of the boys' school, but all these visits proved of no avail


<p27>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             27

  since, while Dr. Youness KhAn was insisting in his views and pointing out the importance  for the Baha'is to close their schools on these days and also explaining the fact that the school authorities, in celebrating their religious holidays, would in no way disregard the ruling and regulations of the Board of Education, the acting Minister was reiterating his statement that the Baha'is should not celebrate their religious holidays. Dr. Youness Kh~n also requested that the Board of Education give a more careful and sympathetic consideration to the matter before  taking an action in respect to two schools of good reputation with an enrollment  of 1500 pupils. Dr. Youness Kh~in asked that the case be submitted to His Majesty for a decision. 

 But the acting Minister gave an unfavorable reply and reiterated his former statements adding that he would have no alternative but to close the schools. 
  "On Thursday, Azer 15th,   

1313 (De-cember  6, 1934)  

 the schools were closed as usual in commemoration of the martyrdom of the Bab. On Saturday afternoon, 

Azer 17th, 1313 (December  

 8) the Chief of the Police Station had, by direction of the Central  Police Department, gone to the boys' school and ordered the closing of the school and sending away of the pupils. 

 The Principal  of the school had immediately carried out the order. The Chief of the Police Station had not left the school building when another police officer came to the school to convey the same order. At that time an official communication was received from the Board of Education. After a short while the Chief of the Inspection Section of the Board of Education went to the school to announce the decision. At the same time a similar notification was given to the girls' schooi. 

 ~!On the same day at 12 o'clock at night the Chief of the Police Station, accompanied  by a policeman, went to the girls' school and to the Kindergarten and took down the signboards placed at the gates of these two institutions. On the following day, Sunday, 

Azer 18th (December 9, 1934)

 a policeman was placed in front of the girls' school and two policemen in front of the boys' school to prevent the students from going to these institutions. 

 It was a very sad and touching scene to the passersby, both Baha'is and others, as some of the pupils, mostly children, were weeping  in the streets, sent out from their beloved school regretting the closing down of the same in a deplorable manner. 

 On the same day at 9.30 A.M. the signboard of the boys' school was also taken down. The school authorities did not fail to notify the parents of non-Bahi'i students that as the Tarbiyat schools were Baha'i institutions which had celebrated Baha'i holidays, the Board of Education had ordered them to be closed. 

 ttAft the closing of the schools the National Spiritual Assembly instructed the friends to abstain from sending their children  to other local schools pending a decision  from the Guardian and obtaining of information as to the definite decision of the Government in respect of the schools in future. 

 Most of the students are still waiting  a decision and have not applied for enrollment in other schools. Even most of the non-Bah&'is, whose children were studying in the Tarbiyat Schools, are most patiently waiting for the reopening of our schools and are regretting and at the same time expressing their astonishment at this unexpected event. 

 It is heard that some of the influential people in Tihrin have referred to the Board of Education and have unofficially complained against the action. 

 ~tSj it has become clear to the National Assembly that the ill-wishers and enemies of the Baha'i Faith have made intrigues against the Baha'is before His Majesty and accused them of being disobedient to the laws of the country and being careless of the interests of Iran and of lacking patriotic feelings towards their country and that, therefore, the order issued for the closing down of schools was based on the sanction of His Majesty which means that His Majesty has in fact taken such a step, the National Assembly, with a view to removing any misunderstanding and disclosing the truth, had recourse to the following means: —  (CA long and detailed telegraphic petition was sent to His Majesty of which a copy was handed to the Royal Secretariat. 

This


<p28>
28               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  step was of no avail since two days after the cablegram was handed to the Telegraph Office the Head of the Departmejat called the Secretary of the National Assembly and told him that as the cablegram was of a complaining nature, he was forbidden to send it to its destination. 

 The Secretary of the Assembly expressed his surprise at hearing  such an illogical statement whereupon the Head of the Telegraph Department replied  most categorically that he could not accept such a telegram which he gave back to the Secretary adding that he could also refund the cost of same. But the Secretary never got back the money and kept the receipt form which was given for it. (Cupon the refusal of the Telegraph Office to accept the cablegram addressed to His Majesty, the National Assembly wrote at once a letter to the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs and asked for due consideration to be given to the matter. 

 CCA petition was sent by the Assembly to the Council of Ministers asking them to remove the difficulties and restrictions created for the Baha'is. 

    CCAS the National Assembly 

 was not quite sure that the copy of the petition addressed to His Majesty was delivered to its high destination by the Royal Secretariat, it considered  the possibility of having further petitions handed to His Majesty through certain high personages. 

 But most of these personages offered their excuse to do this favor on the grounds that His Majesty was exceedingly angry with the Baha'is. 

 Among these personages, however, His Excellency Jam, the Minister of the Interior, offered to hand the Assembly's petition to the Shih when a favorable occasion should arise. A comprehensive petition was, therefore, drawn up and handed to His Excellency Jam for delivery to His Majesty. 

 ~tThe Directory Body of the Tarbiyat Schools Committee, by direction of the National Assembly, wrote a long letter to the Board of Education regarding the cios-ing  of the schools and sent it by the local post (since the letter would have been refused  if sent otherwise). 

 ttln the meantime various regrettable reports  were received from provinces and districts in Iran as follows: — "Information was received from Qazvin through a traveller stating that the local Board of Education had closed the girls' school and that the Police had forbidden Baha'i meetings and gatherings. 

 It was surprising that the local Police had forbidden the Baha'is to have their dead buried in the Baha cemetery Gu1ast~n-i-Javid, suggesting that the Baha'is should acquire a piece of ground near the Mubammadan cemetery and bury there their dead without performing any rites or ceremonies so that there may be no different treatment in favour of the Baha'is. It is evident that the friends have never complied with such instructions which are against their conscience  and religion and will never do so in the future. 

 t~A report was received from K~shin that the local Board of Education had closed down the Baha'i school Vahdat-i-Bashar in that town and the police had forbidden all Baha gatherings and meetings, both private  and public in the Ija;iratu'L-Quds  and in private houses. The Principal of the school was detained for a few days and Aghai Foroughi, one of the leading friends, was imprisoned some days. 

 ttWe quote hereafter some excerpts from the report recevied from the Assembly in KtMn: —  "On December 9th last the Chief of Police sent a message to the Spiritual Assembly through one of the friends, Dr. Sulaym~n Bergis, that Baha meetings, both private and public, should be stopped and that no Baha'i should openly declare his faith. The following day the police arrested the guardian of the Haziratu'1-Quds premises  and made him give a written assurance that no Baha'i meetings should be held in the Baha'i Center. 

 (CO December 13th last the Chief of Police, accompanied by another official and a number of policemen and an inspector from the Detectives, went to the Vabdat-i-Bashar schools for boys and girls and closed down the same by order from the capital. Then the party proceeded to the Ija4ratu'l-Quds  and ordered that nobody should visit this place. They also confiscated the furniture and articles of the boys' and girls' schools and sent out the gatekeeper of the

Relics of the Bab.

30               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Hazi ratu'1 — Quds from this building. Then they took Mirza. tAbb4s Khan Mahmudi, the Principal of the School, to the police, arrested him there for three days with a view to frightening him and forcing him to deny his faith, but all without any avail. On the following day Dr. 

Sulayrnin Bergis and Mirza 

 Moussa Youssefian were taken to the police. The former was released after a short while, but the latter was held until the following day. They were both released on bail. Again another friend was taken to the police and after using bad language against him and against the Cause, they released him. The Maaref at school at Ann (a suburb of K~shin) was also closed. At present all Baha'i institutions are closed and suspended and the Baha'i schools and the Haziratu'1-Quds, which belongs to the Cause, have been locked up by the Government officials. 

 These buildings  are liable to be damaged and even pulled down by rain and snow should they remain locked up in their present state. Any Baha'i who may profess his faith openly is liable to be arrested. For the last eighty years the friends in K~shAn had not experienced such restrictions and difficulties. One of the friends named 

Agha Mul?arnmad Forouzan   

 was made to give a written assurance that he will not receive any guests in his house. 

 CcTh pupils who were studying in the Baha schools are left without any decision and are having their time wasted since they will not be admitted in Muhammadan schools unless they renounce their faith, a course which they will never adopt. 

 "We have received a report from Hamadin saying that the Haziratu'1-Quds  has been closed and that gatherings and meetings have been forbidden. 

     "The Spiritual Assembly    

 in SultAn-AbAd (Aragh) have sent Aghai Noush Abadi, the teacher, to Tihr&n and sent a message through the latter that the police have closed the Haziratu'1-Quds, confiscated the correspondence and archives of the Assembly and that they have even taken away the tiles bearing Baha'i inscriptions which were fixed up on the walls of the Ija?iratu'l-Quds hail. 

   "The Assembly in KirminshTh

 have sent a report saying that the police have closed the Haziratu'l-Quds  and forbidden all the meetings. 

 The preachers are using abusive language on the Cause and inducing the fanatical class to rise against the friends. 

 ((Si A news was received from almost every corner of the country, but such events had not taken place in Tihrin till it was lately heard that the police had issued some circular instructions to its various branches both in the provinces and in the capital to prevent strictly Baha'i activities and suspend all gatherings and meetings and prosecute and arrest everybody who professes his faith openly and also to dismiss from the Government service any Baha'i who declares his faith openly. Since the issue of these instructions the restrictions began to appear for the friends in Tihr6t: all Baha'i gatherings and meetings, both private and public, which used to be held in the Uaziratu'1-Quds and private houses, and even some of the Character Training Classes of children were suspended and those friends who used to have meetings in their houses were forced to give written assurance that they would not hold any. Some of the friends were called to the police and warned that they should not declare their faith openly, but as the friends had categorically  refused to respond to the call and preferred to suffer all sorts of calamities rather than to comply with the wishes of the officials, the matter was not taken up any further. 

 t~Then some of the local papers and magazines in TihrAn, taking advantage of the occasion, began to write articles attacking the Baha'i schools and the Baha'is. One of the local preachers, Shariat Sanglaji, referring  to the attack made in some of the papers, had, in the course of the speech he had delivered for the public, expressed his utmost joy and gratitude at the action taken by His Imperial Majesty in closing up the Baha'i schools which, in the opinion of the preacher, were prejudicial to the good morals of those Muhammadan students who were studying in the Baha'i schools. 

 ccAccording to information received, the schools of Tayyid and Mowbebat in Hamad~n have been closed by order of the local 

Educational Department     
and the in

  tervention of the Police, who had driven away the pupils from the schools in a most discourteous and harsh manner. 

 "The question relating to the unveiling of women is progressing most satisfactorily and rapidly in this country. 

 The majority of the female class both in the capital and in the provinces have discarded their veils and joined the new movement. 

 "Special meetings were arranged first by Government departments and then by merchants,  various guilds, municipal institutions, etc., where various classes of people were present with their wives without any veils. According to the local press, a number of Mullis and priests as well as some notaries public have attended these meetings with their wives. Some of these Mullis have delivered speeches in support of the new movement and proving that the discarding  of the veil has no connection whatsoever with religion. This is most strange and surprising especially when taking into view the utmost degree of fanaticism and narrow-mindedness for which the ecclesiastical class in this country are known. 

 "It may be worth mentioning here that the cidn~ newspaper published in Tihrin has lately reproduced the picture of a number of MullAs and the ecclesiastical class in Qazyin, I r~n, accompanied by their wives attending a meeting held in that town to celebrate the unveiling of women. 

 "The Government, with a view to supporting the movement, has imposed certain restrictions on the fanatical class who are reluctant to joint the movement. Thus women with their veils on are not allowed to use public means of transport and 'buses, go to public shows, pictures and caf6s and cross public streets and thoroughfares. These restrictions are being increased every day. 

    "The Spiritual Assembly   

 in Tihr~n, in view of the present movement relating to discarding of the veil, have considered that Baha'i women should also join the movement and discard their veils at once and attend public meetings with their husbands. 

 "Special meetings are held by the Assembly for the friends both for men and women in TihrAn where they are taught manners and how to behave themselves in society. Qualified Baha'i teachers are managing these meetings." 
                          
PROGRESS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE HOUSE OF WORSHIP      
        IN AMERICA                

  With the completion of the external decoration of the dome, reported in the previous volume, the Baha'i House of Worship on Lake Michigan assumed a new and more impressive, as well as more beautiful, aspect. 

 By the union of the architect's genius for design, with the builder's advance in the use of plastic concrete, an effect has been obtained which the professional engineer  and architect recognize as a great forward step and the layman perceives as an extraordinarily appealing development in architecture. 

 The edifice is so situated upon the North Shore highway that the dome and clere: story sections are visible at turns in the road long before the main structure appears. These two sections, indeed, constitute an organic unit, bound together by the vertical pillars supporting the nine great ribs. 

 "When, therefore, the clerestory section was finished by August, 1935, the first stage in the decoration of the external surface  of the House of Worship bad been fully accomplished. The throng of visitors, and the host of persons employing the highway  adjacent to the Temple site, can now begin to appreciate the majesty with which the completed building will herald the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 For the believers, the completion of the clerestory section represented also a triumph of sacrifice and devotion long sustained and ardently borne. Their hopes and expectations, centered in Temple construction over a period of ten years, came to a temporary fulfilment as they felt the deepened unity and insight acquired as result of such intense concentration upon a tremendous task. 
                          
    NATIONAL ARCHIVES         

  The longing to collect, publish and perpetuate the Tablets of the Baha'u'llah and


<p32>
32              THE BAHA'I WORLD

 cAbdu~1~Bahi keenly felt by believers in all countries since the early days of the Faith, came to definite organized expression among the Baha'is of North America more than twenty years ago. A National Archives was established to which all American believers  were requested to send the Tablets they had received from the Master. Three volumes of Tablets were soon made available,  and the contents of a fourth volume are now ready for the press. In addition to these Tablets, sacred Baha'i relics and valuable historical material have likewise been acquired and preserved. The Archives Committee in America, indeed, has developed  its function to the point where a special storage space and reference room will soon be needed. 

 Similar National Archives  

 have been initiated  in Egypt, Pin, Germany, 

America and India. The     

 next step in this important function of the administrative order will be the formation of local Archives by the various Spiritual Assemblies in cities and towns. 

 Not less than fourteen volumes of Tablets  revealed by Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha, compiled under the direction of National Spiritual Assemblies, have been sent to the International 

Baha'i Archives on Mt.     
Carmel.                    
                           
    THE DIVINE POLITY          

  The period of two years covered by The Baha'i World, 'Jot. VI, has been characterized  by the establishment of two important principles controlling the relation of the Baha'i community to its social enyiron-. ment. 

 In the words of tAbdu~1Bah~ the Baha'is follow a divine polity rather than the competitive, changing and fruitless programs of a misguided world. 

 The first of these principles is that Baha'is in all countries refrain from individual  as well as collective political activi —  ties. They accept no office dependent upon political influence, and take no part in the clash of partisan movements and interests. Loyal to the enactments of their respective governments, the followers of Baha'u'llah stand apart from any activity or influence which can in any way jeopardize their spiritual unity transcending race, nation and class. 

 On the one hand, the Baha'is are animated by the conviction that the problems  of humanity can only be solved by the union and solidarity of mankind in crone Faith and one Order." On the other hand, the Baha'is are devoting their lives and resources  to the upbuilding of a universal civilization not compatible with systems based upon war and strife. 

 This attitude is not to be confused with that of the t~conscientious objector" whose individual outlook compels him to reject, if necessary, the function of government for the sake of his conviction. 

 The Baha'is are not retreating into a subjective attitude, but rather seeking to learn the divine art of a unity and cooperation which in itself represents the highest goal of social effort. 

 In the words of Shoghi Effendi: "This principle is no other than that which involves  the nonparticipation by the adherents  of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as local or National Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 "Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed, with thc political pursuits of their respective nations, with the policies of their governments  and the schemes and programs of parties and factions. 

 In such controversies they should assign no blame, take no side, further no design, and identify themselves with no system prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide Fellowship which it is their aim to guard and foster. 

 Let them affirm their unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly,  for the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God s immutable  Purpose for all men. 

 ttLet them proclaim that in whatever country they reside, and however advanced their institutions, or profound their desire to enforce the laws, and apply the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, they will, un


<p33>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             33

  hesitatingly, subordinate the operation of such laws and the application of such principles  to the requirements and legal enactments  of their respective governments. 

 "Though loyal to their respective governments, though profoundly interested in anything that affects their security and welfare, though anxious to share in whatever  promotes their best interests, the Faith with which the followers of Baha'u'llah stand identified is one which they firmly believe God has raised high above the storms, the divisions, and controversies of the political arena. Their Faith they conceive  to be essentially nonpolitical, supranational  in character, rigidly nonpartisan, and entirely dissociated from nationalistic ambitions, pursuits, and purposes. 

 Such a Faith knows no division of class or of party firmly convinced that in a world of interdependent peoples and nations the advantage of the part is best to be reached by the advantage of the whole, and that no abiding benefit can be conferred upon the component parts if the general interests of the entity itself are ignored or neg —  lected." 

 The second principle upholding the integrity  of the Baha Order is that which similarly sunders the tie which serves to bind any believer to the religious sect or church with which he might have previ —  ousiy been associated. The Baha'i does not retain formal membership in any creedal institution, since his faith compels him to live within a larger spiritual society than can exist outside the World 

Religion of Baha'u'llah.  

 Desiring to form part of a new and regenerated humanity able to perceive its fundamental oneness and forge bonds of enduring fellowship and cooperation, the Baha'i has come to realize that this intention is incompatible with a traditional  religious connection whose society is artificially restricted and whose development has been intertwined with historical controversies negating the real purpose of revealed religion. 

 The following words of Shoghi Effendi have defined the principle for the 

Baha'i community: "The     

 separation that has set in between the institutions of the Baha'i Faith and the IslAmic ecclesiastical organizations izations that oppose it imposes upon every loyal upholder of the Cause the obligation  of refraining from any word or action that might prejudice the position (that is, that of an independent religion) which our enemies have in recent years and of their own accord, proclaimed and established.  This historic development, the beginnings of which could neither be recognized nor even anticipated in the years immediately preceding tAbdu'1-BaM's passing,  may be said to have signalized the Formative Period of our Faith and to have paved the way for the consolidation of its administrative order. As this movement gains momentum, as it receives added im —  petus from the attitude and future action of the civil authorities in I ran, it will inevitably manifest its repercussions in the 'West and will rouse the leaders of the Church and finally the civil authorities to challenge the claims and eventually to recognize the independent status of the Religion of Baha'u'llah. Though our Cause unreservedly recognizes the Divine origin of all the religions and upholds the spiritual truths which lie at their very core and are common to them all, its institutions, whether administrative, religious or humanitarian, must if their distinctive character is to be maintained and recognized,  be increasingly divorced from the outworn creeds, the meaningless ceremonials  and manmade institutions with which these religions are at present identified." 

 On March 11, 1936, the Guardian referred  again to this important subject. ccTh Faith of Baha'u'llah has assimilated, by virtue of its creative, its regulative and ennobling energies, the varied races, nationalities, creeds and classes that have sought its shadow, and have pledged unswerving fealty to its cause. It has changed the hearts of its adherents, burned away their prejudices, stilled their passions, exalted their conceptions, ennobled their motives, coordinated their efforts, and transformed their outlook. While preserving their patriotism and safeguarding their lesser loyalties, it has made them lovers of mankind,  and the determined upholders of its best and truest interests. 'While maintain


<p34>
34               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ing intact their belief in the Divine origin of their respective religions, it has enabled them to visualize the underlying purpose of these religions, to discover their merits, to recognize their sequence, their interdependence, their wholeness and unity, and to acknowledge the bond that vitally links them to itself. Their Faith, Baha'is firmly believe, is undenominational, nonsectarian, and wholly divorced from every ecclesiastical system, whatever its form, origin, or activities. 

 Like two mighty pillars, these policies uphold the Baha'i community high 'above the controversies by which every other society is being overwhelmed. 

 They mark a definite turning point in the history of the Faith, inaugurating that new era of development which the Guardian has termed the Formative Period. 

 For the individual believer they are a truly providential protection  against the impact of a decaying civilization whose influences otherwise would betray all but the most determined and spiritually evolved souis. As the tree cannot resist the flame which sweeps destructively through the forest, so the human personality in such a conflagration of feeling as now rages upon earth cannot, without protection, resist the myriad tongues of psychological fire darting at him and penetrating his shell of custom, to consume  the sacred spirit within. 

 Justification of the Divine Polity is not necessary, since current events in all parts of the world reveal the disastrous results incurred by confusing spiritual values with political policies, and religious aims with movements which are essentially materialistic behind their mask of slogan and phrase. In the long perspective, the success with which the Baha'is have understood, accepted and acted upon these two principles would alone constitute a vast achievement, were they able to serve the Faith at the time in no other way. By such successive steps is the World Order of Baha'u'llah emerging as a new world, a world in which man may be truly human — a world more and more separated from the wilderness of civilization in which vast hordes of bewildered people see no outcome except struggle to the death. 

EXTENSION OF TEACHING ACTIVITIES 
IN EUROPE                  

  The powerful efforts of Baha'i communities  established in Europe to promote the Faith have been reinforced by a number of American believers who have been resident or traveling during the past two years. 

 Among these workers in the field may be cited Miss Martha L. Root, Mrs. 

Helen Bishop, Miss Marion  

 Jack, Miss Julia Goldman, Mrs. Jeanne Bolles, Miss Jeanne Bolles, Mrs. May Maxwell, Miss Mary Maxwell, Mrs. Sylvia Matteson, and Mrs. 

Louise Gregory.            

 Since the previous International review was prepared, Miss Root has visited and worked constantly in Greece, Rumania, Jugoslavia, Austria, Hungary, Latyja, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland. Notable interviews given her by royalty, statesmen and leading educators have been published in World Order, the magazine of the American National 

Spiritual  Assembly. Her  

 article describing her visit to Iceland has likewise been published in the same magazine. 

 Concentrating upon her effort to impress the vital importance of Baha'u'llah's 'World Faith upon the minds of the most influential and responsible leaders of opinion, Miss Root has found it possible to meet in personal audience with Dowager Queen Marie of Rumania, King Haakon of Norway, Prince Paul of Jugoslavia, 

President Bene~ and Ex-President 

 Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, Princess  Olga of Jugoslavia, Princess Marina of Greece, now Duchess of Kent, and 

Archduchess  Anton. Other 

 leaders similarly met were Mine. Tsaldaris, wife of the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Constantine Kotzias, Mayor of Athens, Mr. Stasys 

Lozo-raitis,  Lithuanian   

 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Erling Eidem, Archbishop of Sweden, in addition to educators in the various countries she visited. 

 In each case, Baha'i literature in the national language was presented. The impressive record, moreover, includes the placing of Baha'i articles in more than one hundred magazines and daily papers throughout northern and eastern Europe,


<p35>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            35

  besides radio addresses delivered in Praha, Oslo and Bergen. 

 In earlier volumes of The Ba/id'! World it has been made clear with what sheer faith this Baha'i has, with slight material resources and no assistance from Baha'i finances, steadily ascended the steep hill of difficulty on her determined pilgrimage throughout the world. 

 'While no one can estimate the direct or indirect results which will in future proceed  from these interviews, radio addresses and widespread publicity, Miss Root's achievement in arranging for new translation  and publication of Baha'i literature stands above the level of conjecture. 

 Thus, c~Bahi~u~11Th and the New Era," by J. E. Esslemont, has appeared in Rumanian and Greek, with a Finnish translation on the press.. 

 Of pamphlets, five thousand copies of ccWht is the Baha'i Movement?" were published in Rumanian, together with an equal number of ccThe Baha'i Movement" in the same language, the translator being Archduchess Anton, the former Princess Ileana of Rumania. During Miss Root's visit to Finland and Iceland, editions of "'What is the Baha'i Movement?" were likewise published in each of these two tongues. 

  The Twenty-Sixth Annual   

 Universal Esperanto Congress, held at Stockholm, August 411, 1934, has been graphically described by Miss Root. 

 ~tAt the opening session I had opportunity to convey the greeting of Shoghi Effendi and the good wishes of the worldwide Baha'i community to the delegates present. Baha'i literature was on sale during the sessions. 

 The special Baha'i session, held on August eleventh, was beautiful and impressive. 

 The Esperantists met in a Council Chamber of the great Parliament building. Twenty nations were represented. Miss Alminda, 

Baha'i and Esperantist    
of Stockholm,  presided. 

 On a long table covered with rich silk the Baha'i books were arranged, Dr. Esslernont's volume in many languages, and a number of books and pamphlets in Esperanto furnished by Dr. and Mrs. Grossmann and the American N. S. A. After the chairman had spoken of the need for the renewal of religion, I summarized the Teachings on spiritual and social evolution. Lidja Zamenhof spoke last, and as one inspired. While attending the Congress I found it possible to publish four Baha'i articles in the press." 

 A detailed program, unfortunately, is not available of the many public lectures which she delivered in the 

Balkan and Scandinavian   

 countries during this period. It can only be stated that a number of new study groups were formed, and at least introductory knowledge of the Cause of God widely spread in new areas of Europe. 

 Sofia, Bulgaria, in which city Miss Marion Jack has resided since her visit to Adrianople (see The Baha'i World, Vol. V, page 581), has witnessed the formation of the first local Baha'i Spiritual Assembly in the Balkan States. The group of interested students of the Teachings with whom the Assembly is now working numbers about 150 persons. 

 While Miss Root has visited and worked in Sofia on more than one occasion,  rendering invaluable assistance, the institution of the Spiritual Assembly was due to Miss Jack's ardent and patient labors. 

 Belgrade, Jugoslavia, has likewise, through the efforts of Mrs. Gregory, become  the center of Baha'i activities now established in what appears to be a permanent  form. In the Serbian language, translated by Mine. Draga Ilic, there is now available a pamphlet summarizing the Teachings as well as Dr. Esslemont's book which was reported in the previous volume. The number of devoted believers has steadily increased, and Belgrade now represents  a nucleus which later will surely evoive into an organized Baha community. 

 Mrs. Bolles and her daughter have assisted the Baha 

Centers in London, Paris  

 and other cities, more particularly Germany. During September, 1935, these American believers traveled to Nuremberg, Dresden, Berlin, Frankforr, Neckargemtind, Heidel-. berg and Karisruhe, addressing groups and finding many opportunities to bring the Faith to the attention of individuals encountered  en route. 

 Similar journeys to Baha'i Assemblies and groups in Germany were made by Mrs. Helen Bishop and Miss Maxwell, after attendance at the Baha'i Summer School held in Stuttgart. 
As a consequence, the


<p36>
36              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  believers of that land have shared their experiences and methods with American coworkers, and in turn learned more directly the principles of the Administrative Order as developed through the American Baha'i community. 

 The American friends have also followed with admiration the accomplishments of Miss Julia Goldman, Mrs. May 

Maxwell and Mrs. Sylvia    
Matteson in Europe.        

 While in Stockholm during 1935, Miss Goldman had an interview with the archaeologist,  Sven Hedin, who expressed his intention of seeing the Baha'i Temple on the occasion of his next journey to Chicago. In Geneva, Miss Goldman met a number of delegates attending the Institute of Intellectual Cooperation. In addition, this teacher published interviews in the Stockholm press and held a large number of public meetings at Baha'i Centers in England. 

 Mrs. Matteson, experienced in press work, assisted the English friends in sending to many newspapers a descriptive article and photographs of the Temple at Wilmette, showing the completed dome unit, with the result that the London Times and other journals published a Temple illustration for the first time. Mrs. Matteson similarly prepared Baha'i material for papers in Germany. 

 The devoted sevices rendered by Mrs. Louise Erickson of Brooklyn, in promoting the Faith both in Sweden and Denmark, by journeys to those lands, by providing for the publication of Swedish translations of Baha'i literature, and by newspaper interviews,  are mentioned with gratitude and appreciation. 

The Spiritual Assembly     

 of Paris in 1935 took occasion to mention the fact that a visitor reported having noted in a Swedish journal that the King of Denmark  had accepted Baha literature presented by Mrs. Erickson. Articles reporting  Mrs. Erickson's Baha'i activities appeared in ttUpsala Nya Tidning," tcU1ri~ cehamn's Tidning," ~Af ton Bladet," and ttDajens 

Nyheter," from March       
to May, 1935.              

 From reports and bulletins received from European Assemblies the following facts are made available. 

 "Highly successful meeting, December 30, 31, of the 

Union of Baha'i Students   
of Europe, held in Paris.  

 "Mrs. May Maxwell left Brussels to attend the Conference in Paris and has returned to carry on the teaching work in Brussels. 

     "During November Miss      

 Mary Maxwell visited 15 Baha'i Centers in Germany, speaking everywhere to the Baha'is and their friends. 
     CCM Jeanne Bolles and      

Miss Bolles left London    

 in December. In St. Moritz they interested several persons in the Cause. Now, upon advice from the Guardian, they have gone to Southern Germany, and will make Miinchen their teaching headquarters. 

 t~Madame Paula Moudrt wellknown writer and peace worker, celebrates her 75th birthday in Praha. 

 The Baha'is there are grateful for the completion of her translation  of the iiqdn into Esperanto. 

 Miss Root spent some days in the city. She is now in Budapest, and will go to Athens to carry forth the work which she has been doing for the past few years. 

 (cThe League of Nations Library has accepted the copies of World Order, filed them, and made them available for readers. 

 ~tEugen Relgis has written a book entitled  Cosrnom6tapolis, which presents fundamental concepts of the crevo1utionary~ and evolutionary movement in politics, economics and sociology. The oniy chapter on Religion is given over to the Baha'i Faith. 

 The author is a Rumanian, but the French translation of his book may be ordered. 

 "At the recommendation of Shoghi Effendi, Er~iu1ein Edith I-bin, member of the National Spiritual Assembly, and Mrs. Charles Bishop, made a tour of the Baha'i Centers in Germany. The InterRelations Committee through Frau Grossmann planned the itinerary, and invited the friends to attend the meetings called for these two visitors. 

 CCAft the close of the Summer School in Esslingen, 

Fr~iu1ein Horn and Mrs.    

 Bishop visited Stuttgart, Zuffenhausen, and Geis —  lingen. 

 Besides these two guests, the friends were delighted with the presence in some of their gatherings of Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell, and Miss Mary Maxwell of Montreal.


<p37>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            37

Fr~iu1ein Els Grossmann   

 of Neckargemiind was also a guest in Stuttgart during these days. 

     ~ Horn and Mrs. Bishop    

 met with the Baha of Dresden at the Nineteenth 

Day Feast on September    

 8th. In Leipzig they had ample time for deliberations with the friends. A special meeting was the reception given by Mrs. Bishop to the Baha'is and their friends. A similar invitation was given by Mrs. Bishop in Berlin. The travelers were delighted with the growth of the Cause in this city: in the last year the Community has doubled its membership. 

 There are now a number of active workers to reinforce the efforts so long sustained by Herr Lebne. In Rbstock, Frau Waicker, and in Warnemiinde Frau Schwedler arranged beautiful meetings for the friends. The Baha'is of these centers on the North Sea are always eager to hear at first hand of the activities of the Cause in other centers. 

 In Hamburg, on two occasions, a large number of the friends rallied to hear the two speakers. 

 cWhul ErThlein Horn went to Frankfurt  to meet with the friends there, Mrs. Bishop went to Heidelberg to address a fairly large study class, led by Dr. and Frau Grossmann at the Museum. In Weinheim an excellent meeting was held. 

 tCOn September 23rd, Efliulein Horn and Mrs. Bishop met again in Stuttgart, to share with members of the National Spiritual Assembly their experiences in the teaching field. The special objects of the tour were as follows: the presentation by Fr~u1ein Horn of the notes which she gathered in conversations with the Guardian during her rememberable pilgrimage last May; the presentation by Mrs. Bishop of fundamental principles of the Administrative Order of the Baha Community, more particularly, the Guardianship according to the Will and Testament of !Abdu'l-Baha, the dependence of the centers upon their National Spiritual Assembly, and the creation of the 

Central Fund.             
     "In February, 1936, the   

National Spiritual  Assembly

 invited Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bishop to work with the Teaching Committee in the new and general activity designed to increase the number of Assem blies in England. The arrival of Mr. David Hofman was timely; and with the help of these friends, the Committee initiated a Teaching Bulletin in order to draw the isolated Baha'is into the National Community  life, more particularly, by treating questions on the Administrative Order and circulating the Guardian's precious letters. The response was immediate and gratifying for the spirited replies also contained lecture engagements for Mr. and Mrs. Bishop's national tour. 

 "In London, the practice of featuring an outside speaker along universal lines, once a month, was abandoned; and the program shared by Hasan Baha'i Effendi, now acclaimed  as a first-rate speaker, Mr. Hofman and Mrs. Bishop, resulted in increased attendance at meetings. Fireside meetings were arranged by the Youth Group, and by Mrs. Katharine Brown, and Lady Blomfield respectively; besides, Mrs. Bishop met with Mrs. George's weekly study class for intensive  work on tThe 

Dispensation of Baha'u'llah.'

 ttHas an Baha'i Effendi, Mr. Hofman, Miss Cansdale and their enthusiastic colleagues  gave a splendid chapter of the International Youth Rally, initiated in America, but observed throughout the Baha'i 

World on March 2 2nd.     

 "In April, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop went to Devonshire. 

 Lectures were given in Tor —  quay at the Theosophical Society, beforc a large audience at the Practical Psychology Center; then at half a dozen friendly firesides  the Faith was discussed with members of the Oxford Group, psychologists, 

Theosophists  and Anglicans.

 Ashburton held its first Baha meeting at the home of a resident Baha'i. 

 Mr. Mark Tobey had been ploughing four years for contacts at Dart-ington  Hall, where he teaches painting. He presented Mrs. Bishop and her lecture before a goodly number in his studio. An American-Norwegian home was then offered for successive lectures with the result that before Mrs. Bishop's departure, the listeners volunteered to form a study class under Mrs. Tbbey's direction. 

 Good news has just come that interest is sustained; sixteen are faithful through the summer holiday season, while the autumn is promising, indeed.

  ttNew members are recorded in the various  Assemblies. 

 London has also gained; but the friends feel keenly the departure of Miss Goldman and Mr. F. St. George Spend-love,  who is ever to be identified with the pioneer work which brought conscious practice of the high technique of Baha'i Administrative procedure. 

 "The friends in Berlin formed this year a Spiritual Assembly. In addition to the Baha'i Feasts there are devotional and instructive meetings each first and third Wednesday, the other Wednesday evenings being reserved for the work of the Spiritual Assembly.

 ccThe report of the community Stuttgart showed vivid activity: general meetings, Unity and other Feasts, Reading and Study Evenings, and the special celebrations and meetings on the occasion of the 13th National Convention. 

 This April, following ing the example of the S. A. of the Baha'is of New York, our S. A. adopted a charter and is thus the first local S. A. of our two countries to be incorporated.

 tcMrs Bolles reported on her journey which, from September 416, 1935, took her to Nuremberg, Dresden, Berlin, Frankfurt a.M., Heidelberg, Neckargemi~nd, and Karisruhe: tMiss Julia Goldman and I arrived in Nuremberg on September 4. In the evening we were called upon by Mr. and 

Mrs. Lorey of Fuertli      

 near Nurenciberg and discussed with them till late many problems of the sacred Cause. 

 Though it is very difficult for the friends to arouse interest for the Cause in their locality they never tire in their efforts to work for the movement. Friday, September 5, we went to Dresden where, in Mr. and Mrs. Koehier's home, there was a gathering of eight friends. After the meeting many questions were put and followed by a discussion. Mrs. Hentschel, one of the friends in Dresden,  invited us for dinner next day, where we met her sons and daughters. 

 There we had also a vivid and interesting discus-Sian 

Ofl the Faith. Saturday    

 afternoon we left Dresden and at night arrived in Berlin. Unfortunately, we missed the Baha'i meeting  through a misunderstanding. 

 Mr. Leline gave us the address of a Berlin friend, to whom we wrote instantly. 

 The next morning she came to our hotel, and by the

  evening brought together twelve friends —  a great achievement considering the long distances in Berlin and the fact that these friends could not be reached by telephone. This evening became one of our most impressive  meetings. 

 Tuesday afternoon we went to Frankfurt a.M., where, at midnight,  Miss Ercimueller met us at the station and conducted us to our hotel. She gave us all of her time next day. 

 At the meeting next evening several gentlemen were present who were mainly interested in the solution of the economic problem from the Baha'i point of view. The requested theme was: History and tenets of the Baha'i Faith. Many questions were asked. 

 We hope that through the devoted efforts of Miss Freimueller, with the aid of Miss Horn and others and God's assistance a solid group will soon be created. Thursday we proceeded to Neclzargerniind. 

 Mrs. Gross-mann  met us in Heidelberg and took us to her beautifully situated home. in the eve-fling  we were expected in Heidelberg by some twenty-eight friends and inquirers; upon their request we spoke about our Baha'i work and experiences in other countries.  There we met again many friends in whose radiant faces we still beheld a reflection of the spirit of the Summer School. The next day found us in Karisruloc. 

 We were glad to see Mrs. Brauns at the station; she made her house our home. 

 The same night Mrs. Brauns had gathered about thirty believers and inquirers in her house and once more we were requested to speak on: Baha'i experiences, the development of the Movement  and its practical influence in our everyday life. Everywhere on our journey did we meet with sincere welcome, true hospitality and kind cooperation which everywhere created the spirit of unity. 

 On our train rides from city to city we gave the Message to many. A number of them to whom we gave literature showed great interest. 

 "Mrs. Bishop reports on her trip which she undertook together with Miss Horn: Upon recommendation of the Guardian, Miss Edith Horn, member of the N. S. A., and Mrs. Charles Bishop took a journey through the Baha'i centers in 

Germany. The Contacts      

 Committee made the itinerary and invited the friends to the meetings arranged for these two visitors. 

 After the conclusion of the Summer-Week at Esslin-gen, 

Miss Horn and Mrs. Bishop  

 visited Stuttgart, Zuffenloausen and Geislingen. On September 8th they met the Baha'i friends in Dresden at the Unity Feast. In Leipzig they had sufficient time for discussions  with the friends. Mrs. Bishop gave a special reception to the Baha and her friends (their friends) Mrs. Bishop gave a iike invitation in Berlin. The travelers had the satisfaction to note the expansion of the Cause in this city: during the last year the community had doubled its numbers. 

 Mrs. Walcker arranged for meetings of the friends in Rbstoclz, and Mrs. Schwed-ler  did so in Warneinjinde. 

 The Baha in these centers are always anxious to hear from a direct source of the Baha'i activities in other centers. A large number of friends assembled twice in Hamburg in order to hear the two speakers. 

 Whilst Miss Horn went to Frankfurt, Mrs. Bishop proceeded to Heidelberg where, at the Museum, she addressed a large study-class. In W/einheim she enjoyed an excellent meeting. Unfortunately it was impossible to meet the friends in Karisruhe during these days. On September 

23rd Miss Horn and Mrs.    

 Bishop joined again in Stuttgart in order to report on their trip to the N. S. A. (CAft our friend Zabih from IrAn had spent some length of time in Stuttgart, he visited, in August and September, the cities of Karisrulge, Heppenhehn, 

Neckargerniind, Heidelberg 

 and Frankfurt. His addresses found vivid interest and left a permanent impression. 

 CtTO celebrate the birthday of Baha'u'llah, the community of Stuttgart had joined with the friends of the vicinity and numerous guests, altogether some 230 persons,  for an impressive meeting at the Gustav Siegle House. 

 Mrs. Alice Schwarz and Dr. Eugen Schmidt addressed the audience.  The evening was rounded out by a musical program, and concluded with a prayer and the singing of a hymn by all. This day, as well as the F&e-Day of tAbdu'1-BahA were commemorated in a dignified way with readings from the testaments  of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-Bah4 and

    "The Baha'i group Heidelberg

 had issued a special invitation for a meeting on November 17th which was designed to create a closer bond between the group in Heidel —  berg and the other friends in Southern Germany. 

 Among the numerous visitors were friends from Esslingen, rrankfurt a.M., Heilbronn, Heppenheim, Karisruhe and Stuttgart. Mrs. A. Schwarz — Stuttgart  — spoke on The Day of God' and Miss Horn — Frankfurt a.M. — told of her trip to Haifa. 

 "Our German Baha'i work received a valuable contribution through the travels of Mr. and Mrs. Eozdar from Bombay (India), Mr. and Mrs. Bishop from Geneva, and 

Mrs. Sylvia Matteson       

 from Chicago (U.     S. A.), who came to Germany upon the special request of the Guardian in order to visit the friends in the different communities,  and to talk to them. The roz-dars, coming from Geneva, arrived on the 12th of September in Stuttgart, where they held a fine spiritual evening with the corn —  munity there; they then proceeded to London, visiting on their way the groups and communities in Heidelberg, Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen. At every place they admonished the friends urgently to always bear in mind their responsibility as bearers of the Baha'i Faith towards a world torn in religious strife and to rise with all their strength to assist in the spiritual construction of the new era. At the end of September Sylvia Matteson, on her trip to London, called on the friends in Stuttgart, Heidelberg, Berlin, and Hamburg. 

 Her report about the Temple in Wilmette, in which she herself served as a guide to groups of visitors, and her narratives of the heroic lives of the great Baha'i martyrs, culminated in a demand of joyful sacrifice, and never-relenting enthusiasm in the service for the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 At the end of September Mr. and Mrs. Bishop commenced their German trip which lasted over a month and touched every place which had a Baha'i community or group. The Guardian had given the special niission to Mrs. Bishop to familiarize the friends with the ideas of the Baha'i administration. 

 After a visit to the Baha'i community in Stuttgart, she addressed the Dresden friends on the 27th and 28th at a well frequented meeting. 

 She devoted three evenings to the friends in Leipzig. 

 At a common meeting of the Quakers and Baha'is in Berlin she delivered an address on the subject tFaith,' and a simple reception in a Baha'i home united the Berlin friends with their guests. Her next stops were R5stock and Warne-miinde.  At both places several meetings took place, inspiring and strengthening the participants. 

 Proceeding to Hamburg, she devoted an evening to Schwerin circle and the friends in Luebeck. During her stay in Hamburg the community there had several intimate and more public meetings. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop made their return trip via Bremen, Frankfurt, Heppenheim, Wein-heim, Heidelberg, Heilbronn, and Karis-ruhe,  exerting their efforts everywhere. 

 The end of the trip saw our guests from Geneva again in Stuttgart, Esslingen, and Goep-pingen.  On the 1st of November they returned to their work at the 

Baha'i BUreau at Geneva.   

 All the time they had worked with indefatigable enthusiasm at all the places, teaching and inspiring. 

 Thus they have made a most important contribution towards the awakening of a new spiritual impulse and an increased devotion to the service in our Faith. Several newspapers brought reports and articles on the occasion of the visit of our friends as the Hamburger Fremdenblatt in its evening edition of September  19, and the Hamburger Tageblatt of the same date, and — concerning the Baha Temple in Wilmette — the Hans-burger  Frei.ndenblatt of October 10 and a Berlin newspaper. 

 "The cause of the German Baha'is has received great impetus through the presence of Mrs. Charles Bishop who, though stationed  in Geneva, has made it possible to come to the Summer School, as also to visit the different groups throughout Germany, often accompanied by Miss Edith Horn who is now attached to the Frankfurt Branch but carries out the Guardian's wish to visit the various German centers from time to time. 

 Mrs. Bishop's great gift as a speaker illuminates the hearts of her audience; the earnestness of her spirit and the

  charm of her personality make Helen Bishop an outstanding figure in the Baha'i Cause and a most welcome guest at every gathering of friends. 

 are glad to state that we have had quite a number of most welcome teachers visiting us, though most of them were not able to stay long; among them were Miss Marion Jack, Mrs. Gregory, Mrs. Bolles, Miss Julia Goldman, Mrs. Thomas Collins, Mrs. May Maxwell, Mr. Spendlove, Mrs. Matteson, Mrs. Bechtold. Mrs. Hoagg, formerly in charge of the Geneva office for many years, until ill-health forced her to take an extended vacation, stayed in Stuttgart for quite a while and was a frequent visitor at the meetings. 
    "Of the German teachers   

Dr. Hermann Grossmann     
shares honors with Dr.    

Adelbert Miihlschlegel    

 and Dr. Eugen Schmidt as the most active speakers before large audiences not only in Stuttgart but in many big and small cities throughout Germany. These three friends have also taken over the greater part of the work given out by the Teaching Committee in connection with the addresses delivered before the Esslingen Summer School, although Frau Alice Schwarz, Frau Schweizer and others have also contributed to this work. 

 "During the last few years several of the Baha'is from I yin studying or employed in Europe have attended the Summer School and their highly spiritual talks have found a strong echo in the hearts of the German believers. 

 Naimi, Morched Sadeh, Ezzatol-lah  Zabih are amongst these Baha'is from Inn, while Dr. Fozdar from Poona and his wife Shirin renewed acquaintances with some of the friends who had visited them in India some nine years ago. 

 t!In years of service to the Cause in Germany 

Frau Alice Schwarz-Solivo 

 stands out as the oldest member, though a great nurn-ber  of very devoted and active ladies could be cited in the South as well as in the North of 

Germany.                  

 "The Meetings of the N. S. A. have been held once a month as a rule; it is at these meetings that one obtains a glimpse of the quiet, persistent and neverending work that is being carried on behind the scenes by the small army of faithful believers who are devoting their life and every spare hour to the service of the Cause. 

 "Nobody, for instance, outside of this small circle of friends can visualize the effort required to cope with the task of translation that is constantly required and that is so urgently needed in view of the fact that relatively so few of the priceless books given to humanity by Baha'u'llah, by !Abdu'l-Baha and by Shoghi Effendi have so far been made accessible to those of the German friends who are not able to read them in English or French. 

 'tWhile Stuttgart and surroundings (Ess-lingen, Goeppingen, Karisruhe, etc.) first saw the Cause firmly established in Germany,  it can be claimed that in Berlin, Frankfurt a.M., Heidelberg, Leipzig, Hamburg,  Dresden, Rdstock and Warnemiinde the Cause has firmly taken root and though the number of declared Baha is not so great as yet, there is no mistaking the fact that the Cause is spreading in Germany. In order to give the somewhat isolated northern  districts all the assistance possible a special committee was formed at the Guardian's suggestion which includes a member of the N. S. A. and it is becoming quite evident that the 

Cause in Northern Germany 

 is thereby being given a new impetus. 

 "Also the Vienna group retrains very loyal and active; in 1934 Herr Franz Pbllinger was a very interested visitor at the Esslingen Summer 

School.                   

 ~tThe reports containing the talks held at the 

Esslingen Summer School   

 were printed for 1933,~ and those of 1934 and 1935 will be printed too and forwarded to Shoghi Effendi. 

 tcTh following German Baha'is visited Haifa:      in 1934: Frau Schweizer, 

Fri. Anna                 

 Kbstlin, Herr Karl Klitzing, Frau Inez and Herr Max Greeven; in 1935:

 ~~ The Teaching meeting, which took place in the 

Baha'i Home at Esslingen  

 from June 8th to 10th, was an experiment in order to find the form and direction for future similar  meetings on a larger scale. Saturday night, Dr. Grossmann greeted the friends and pointed out the special character of the gathering as a preparation for teaching —  Entitled 

"Lebensgestaltung."


<p43>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             43

  an activity supplementing the task of the Baha'i Summer-Weeks which are devoted to a study of the teachings. He emphasized the twofold nature of the task which confronts  the Baha'i teacher — and it is the duty of every individual Baha'i to teach and spread the teachings according to his faculty and possibilities: first to be aflame with the recognition of his sacred tasks in the service of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, to absorb its spirit and to possess an unshakeable faith in the aiding power of our religion,  second to undergo a careful training. To this second task was devoted the work of the Teaching Meeting which, in short theoretical introductions and in practical exercises which held the keen and active interest of all participants, covered the most important prerequisites for the training of the Baha'i teacher. Then Dr. Eugen Schmidt spoke on cspreading the Baha'i Teachings.' 

 This requires above all our wholehearted and sustained efforts towards a realization and application of the 

Baha principles. Most     

 important and essential for the expansion of the Sacred Cause is our spiritual attitude, our self-effacement and our way of living. 

 The Baha'i teacher must always be prompted by an untiring effort to put his words into practice. Our words are iike accepted drafts which some day are presented to us to be honored. The qualities  which a Bab~'i teacher should possess are enumerated in the Tablets to Baha'i teachers and leaders, in which Abdu'l-Baha demands from the teacher above all purity, integrity, spirituality, and responsibility. 

 CcThe two following days brought five themes and practical exercises. 

 "Speaking on ~Selecring and Organizing the Material,' Dr. Grossrnann commenced by pointing out the importance of being able to find the appropriate and most striking quotations when answering questions. It is therefore necessary that everyone read and study the writings. 

 It is also recommended to read the Bible and the Qur'an as they are often referred to. At present only a fraction of Baha'u'llah's and tAbdu'1-BaM's writings have been translated or pub-lisbed,  whilst translations can never claim to possess the same degree of authenticity as the original. Thus we are faced with many difficulties when we try to understand the Sacred Writings. A constant study of the writings and meditation on the texts will develop our understanding and capacity, but we must always be ready to revise our conceptions: as our understanding can be only relative and as our capacity should always be in a state of development, we must never hold dogmatically on to our conceptions if we are desirous of spiritual development. 

 ttThen Dr. Grossmann discussed what Baha'i Literature has been translated into German so far. We must distinguish between  texts by Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-BahA,  and records of their utterances taken down by other people. 

 The writings of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-Bahi are mostly in the form of Tablets and Letters. There are also a number of recorded addresses and table talks of CAbdu~1~Bah~ of which those examined and approved by him, may, in a certain sense, rank with his Tablets and Letters. 

 But notes or reports of others, made after their conversation with tAbdu'1-BaM, are often unreliable and must therefore be considered unauthentic. The Baha teacher should avoid referring to them or use them oniy with the necessary reservations. 

 Then Dr. Grossmann gave a survey of the contents, purpose, and arrangement of all Baha'i books published in the German language. 

 The practical suggestions about the arrangement of a reference index should cause every Baha'i to compile one for himself.  Each of the three customary systems (book, card, and looseleaf) has its advantages and drawbacks. 

 C(Th second theme COtS was discussed  by Dr. Miihlschlegel. 

 An historical survey showed what can be accomplished with training in this art. 

 The characteristic of the Greek orator was his adaptability, that of the Roman his clear, somewhat rigid but logical and convincing manner. 

 The Baha'i who is practicing oratory should heed many things. One of the most important  points is the training of the memory. Dr. Miihlschlegel then dwelt on the technique  of speaking, breathing, physical and mental attitude of the speaker, the necessity to inspire and lead his audience to action, etc.


<p44>
44              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  t~Then by way of practice Robert Schult-heiss  gave a little speech on 'Faith, 

Knowledge  and Inspiration.'

 "In the third theme Dr. Schmidt gave fundamental guiding lines regarding the structure and arrangement of study classes. The difference between a study class and a lecture consists in the participation of every individual. A study class has, therefore, the character of a colloquium. 

 The following  points should be heeded for the arrangement  of study classes: the number of participants should not be too large so that every one may take an active part in the discussion and may get acquainted with the others. 

 Second, the themes should be well connected and follow in logical sequence. The evening may be opened by a short presentation of the theme and followed by a discussion into which all present should be drawn. 

 The other method of working out tile theme by questions and answers, can also be made very interesting. 

 Our enthusiastic  and convinced efforts for the great Cause should be coupled with adequate restraint; above all, personal attacks, amons the participants, should be avoided. If we want to spread our belief we must first establish it firmly in ourselves. 

 Then Dr. Schmidt spoke on tGod and Creation' in a manner designed for study classes, and the participants could recognize clearly what a difficult and responsibk task it is to be the leader of such a study class. The essential prerequisite is a complete mastering  of the subject and related themes. Only when these can be met should a Baha'i teacher undertake this task. In conclusion and by way of confirming the aforesaid, Abdu'l-Baha's discourse on ~God and the Creation' was read. 

 ttThe fourth theme was devoted to the character of Baha Feasts. Dr. Grossmann discussed several points regarding invitations, choice of locality, its decoration, musical introductions, reading from the Sacred Writings and short addresses. 

 As the Baha'i Faith knows no services in the traditional form of our churches, special attention should be given to the arrangement of our Baha'i Feasts, which should become a vital experience to friends of the Cause and believers alike. The Nineteenth Day Feasts bear a special character. They are divided into prayer, readings and devotion,  and reports of the Spiritual Assembly, and the serving of refreshments which may be very simple and inexpensive. The first part serves as common spiritual communion of the friends with God; in the second part every believer should share the work of the community and the whole Cause. 

 The presentation of refreshments is an outward symbol of the spiritual bond existing between  the members of the community. These words were followed by a Baha'i Feast during which Miss Horn reported on her trip to 

Haifa.                     

 tCThe third day of the Teaching Meeting was devoted to the fifth and last theme, 'Discussions.' 

 Dr. Schmidt spoke on its outward and Dr. Miihlschlegel on its inward  requirements. 

 It is of extreme importance that the leader know his own limitations and avoid the discussion of questions  which he could not answer satisfactorily. 

 Courtesy and poise should always be observed. The inquirer should be treated as a friend and not as opposition; his questions  should be met with an understanding attitude. 

 The religious character of the discussions  should never be forgotten. The audience often asks questions of a political character or plain political questions. 

 Here the discussion leader should point out that his discourse is based on a religious and not on a political platform and turn the discussion to the religious sphere. 

 After his address, the leader should endeavor to reconcile  diverging opinions and to lead those expressing them to a recognition of the Baha'i standpoint. This was followed by a practical demonstration, preceded by addresses  on the following themes: 1) Unity, 2) Religion and Science, 

3) Religious Cycles. For   

 the first theme leaders for the discussion were for 10 minutes: Bruno B~uer, Fred Kohier, Mrs. Anna Grossmann; for the second, Mrs. Hiede Schubert, Alfred Schweizer, and for the third, Miss Liesel Mueller and Mrs. Anna Schoch. 

 The audience  would ask questions which, at times, got the leader into hot water, and his effort to find the right answer was extremely instructive. 

 It was demonstrated that the Baha'i discussion leader must meet very


<p45>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES              45

  high requirements to be able to find the right and comprehensive answer to the essential  point of the question. 

    CCThis Teaching Meeting    

 which was attended  by 40 friends from the Southern part of Germany, was a first experiment but its success makes us hope that we shall meet more often for this purpose. 

 "Many years have passed since the two great writers of France, Gobineau and Renan, called the attention of their readers to BaLi'ism, awakening an interest which grows as the years pass. 

 "Later, the Baha'i friends of France twice bad the privilege of receiving tAbdu'1-BaM Himself. 

 ttln France, the Baha'i Faith is considered a great ideal, a worthy doctrine, and it can be said, without the slightest exaggeration, that both the press and public express opinions  and ideas which clearly show a similar tendency. 

 "The group in Paris is still rather limited in the number of active members, but it is fortunately being increased by young students  from frTh as well as by Baha'i friends passing through Paris. 

 (cRegular meetings are held as follows: 

     "At Mrs. Edwin Scott's     
studio — every fortnight.    

 ttAt Miss Sanderson's home — every month (these meetings are consecrated exclusively to the young students of fr~n). 

    (CThe Spiritual Assembly   

 meets once a month at the home of Mrs. Dreyf us-Barney. 

 "The annual Congress of the Union of Baha'i Students is held at Mrs. Scott's studio at the end of the year. 

 ccTh topics discussed on December 29 and 30 were: 1) History of Religions and their connection with the Baha'i Faith. 

 2)  Baha'i Education, the basis of World Peace. 3) Know thee thyself 

(Socrates).                

 4)  How best to promote the Baha'i Cause. "A small group has been formed this year at Lyons by a few persons interested in the Cause and regular meetings are held. 

 "The Paris group take a special interest in the translation of Baha'i works and have recently published the second edition of the Essay on 

Bab's, by Hippolyte      

 Dreyfus, which has attained a well deserved success, and also a pamphlet cBh~~i 

Its History, Its Universal 
Application.'              

 ctSverl hundred volumes of works on the Cause have been offered to the Munich pal and University authorities and now have a place in the catalogues of Public libraries and universities. 

 ccMadame Hess, in collaboration with Mademoiselle Alcan, has translated into French C cAbdu~1~BahA~s Paris Talks,' and Monsieur des Hons has translated ~The Mysterious Forces of Civilization,' both of which will be published shortly. 

 "It must be added, that if the French public fail to respond to any attempts of propaganda of the Cause, it, nevertheless, shows a keen interest in the social, philosophical and historical sides of the Teachings." 

 Concerning activities during 193 51936, the Spiritual Assembly of Paris has prepared the following: "Nous avons venu cette ann6e les m&mes sortes de rThnions que les ann6es pr&~dentes mais dies ont &~ suivies par un plus grand nombre de personnes.

  ccTh Cause in the British Isles has three main centers of activity — London, Manchester and Bournemouth groups for study are forming in Bradford, York and Orping-ton.  The enrollment of professed followers does not show great increase; but the work goes on steadily. 

 Large public meetings are not practicable where there is a dearth of trained speakers; but at the 

Center in Lon              

 don where public meetings are now held on Sunday evenings at 6:30 P.M. some aspect of the Movement is always the subject of an address, and questions are invited. 

 "Sometimes the address is given by a non-Bah&'i on some allied topic, and then the chairman is ready to follow with a short speech linking up the Baha'i view of the subject. Among the speakers have been The Rev. Magnus Ratter of the Theistic Church, Mr. 

Brian Goddard and Mr.      
Allan Burnett Rae of the   

New Commonwealth (an International

 Peace Society which embodies in its principal objectives some of the teachings of the Master on the subject), Miss Christine Fraser and Mr. Wren of the League of Nations Union, and Mr. Judd of the L.N.U. Education Committee, The Rev. Leslie Belton, Unitarian Minister, and Mr. H. Polak. 

 t~Among visitors from other lands who have helped at the meetings have been tAbdu'1 Ijusayn KlAn Naimi, and Mr. and Mrs. Fuad Ruhani from Iran, Mrs. Stuart French of California, Dr. and Mrs. Fozdar of Bombay, and 

Miss Julia Goldman from Honolulu.

 "Baha speakers have been asked to address  the New Thought Conference, the Brotherhood Movement, a Theosophist Group, a Toc H. Center, and meetings convened  at Cambridge, 

Doncaster and Brighton.   

 ccDuring the Feast of Ridvan, 1935, considerable attention was attracted by an exhibition  in the 

London Center of Baha     

 books and pictures, also of personal belongings of the Founders of the Movement in the possession of the Assembly. 
  "Another feature was a     

Meeting of Thanksgiving    

 and Commemoration of the Jubilee of King George V. Parts of the Tablet to Queen Victoria were read and the special prayer composed by tAbdu'1-Bah4 on behalf of King George V. was recited. 

 ttThere are Youth Groups for the study of the teachings in London and Manchester. 

 Some members of the former attended a 

Summer School at Shoreham  
in 1934.                   

 CtAnother development in London has been the formation of a Women's Service Committee which undertakes to collect

  funds and carry out charitable and humanitarian  projects. 

 "Some of our friends who have not definitely  joined the Movement have given very welcome service on this Committee. 

    "In Bournernouth the Friends

 have a special  fund for the relief of those who are sick or in financial difficulty. 

 (CA notable contribution to the literature of the Movement has been made by the publication of tTh Promise of All Ages' by Christophul. This gives a scholarly and comprehensive view of the Great Universal Age which is beginning, and cannot fail to impress the reader. The author traces from the writings of the past how seers and thinkers of all time have foreseen this Day, and how the Founders of all the religious systems of the world have taught their followers  to look forward to it. "With a wealth of detail and quotation from classic writings we are shown the history  of the ages as a single epic, conceived of God from the beginning and unfolding with the majestic rhythm of His Purpose till the Great Day dawns and the era of man's regeneration evolves, the Most Great Peace is established, and unity, harmony and love reign supreme. To many outside readers  it will give a new comprehension of the essential oneness of the diverse religions and beliefs, and a vision of hope for the future in a coherent explanation of the meaning and purpose of successive revelations. 

 Many readers have exclaimed, tWhy have we never heard of this before?' 

 "Another publication has been cTh Drama of the 

Kingdom' by Mrs. Basil     

 Hall, founded on a plan indicated by the Master when He was in London. 

 "Reviews and notices of the Baha'i Movement  appear constantly in a Scottish weekly paper, The John o' Groat's Journal. 

 t~During the past two years three friends who have served the Cause well, have passed beyond the veil. 
     "On August 31st, 1934,     

George Paigrave Simpson    
passed after a long illness.

 He had retired from active work some time previously; but we do not forget the years when he held office both on the London and National  Assemblies. 

 His careful and thorough business methods were of great service in the early days of forming the Assemblies, and for many years he devoted all his leisure hours to the correspondence and work of the Movement. 

 "On Whitmonday, 1935, passed Elsie Lea, for many, years Treasurer and member of the London 

Spiritual Assembly. She    

 was among those who had the privilege of meeting the Master when He was in this country, and her devotion to His memory was the motive power of her life. Through a long and painful illness her faith remained clear and strong and was her light to the end. Nine of the friends were present when her body was laid to rest and a memorial meeting  was afterwards held at the 

London Center.             

 ~tAnother great ioss was sustained by the London Group in the passing of Harry Romer. Accounts of his life and work will appear elsewhere; but it remains to record the thankfulness of the friends for the privilege of receiving him in their midst, and for the fellowship they have enjoyed with his rare spirit. The 'oss which the London Group has experienced in the return  of Mrs. Annie Romer to the United States is a very real one. Her labors and sacrifices for the Cause were untiring, and we pray that she may receive the oniy reward to which she looked. 

 C(During the past year the Cause has been registered with the authorities as a definite Religious Community; and the Center in London has the status of a Place of Worship. 

 "In reviewing the progress of the Movement  during the last two years, one recognizes that while there is heartfelt appreciation of the truth and wonder of the Universal Teachings, there is a very real reluctance to enter into anything like sectarian  bonds. 

 The more thoughtful have just escaped from old exclusive viewpoints and quite plainly say that they do not desire to commit themselves to any one denomination; but in a country which has made, and is prepared to make, such tangible sacrifices  for the ideals of universal peace and brotherhood, one can see evidences that the Spirit of Baha'u'llah is working strongly and effectively, and one may be full of hope for the future."

    TEACHING ACTIVITIES        
     IN SOUTH AMERICA           

  An important series of translations have been made during recent years by Miss Leonora Holsapple, long resident as a Baha'i teacher in Baha, Brazil. The titles include "Baha'u'llah and the New Era" in Spanish and Portuguese, the "Paris 

Talks" of Abdu'l-Baha     

 and "The Most Great Peace" in the latter language. This service concentrated  the teacher's ardent and sacrificing efforts for some years. 

 In 1935, however, Miss Holsapple, assisted  by interested natives, rented a house well situated for public meetings. The first meeting was held on the Anniversary of the Birth of the BAt, and Miss Holsapple writes that she is very encouraged by the results, and particularly by the devotion with which the nucleus of bUievers, lacking material resources, contributed physical labor for the preparation of the new center. 

 It is her hope to be able to print a number  of other translations she has made, particularly  the Hidden 

Words and Prayers. Manuscript

 translations of "Some Answered Questions," the ttfq~~" and other Baha'i works likewise exist which later will be issued in printed form. 

 During the winter of 19341935, Mr. and Mrs. E. R. Mathews carried out an extensive journey through South America, following their trip to Australia and New Zealand, for the sole purpose of stimulating definite and lasting interest in the Baha'i Faith. While too extensive to include the entire report in this summary, the following excerpts from their record are more than sufficient to indicate the degree of the accomplishment. 

 "As we had journeyed to South America with a definite Baha'i program, that of forming groups for the study of the Baha'i Faith, as well as to find individuals of capacity,  who could comprehend Baha'u'llah's program for a future civilization, we gathered  facts about the countries through which we were to travel. Thus we learned that while outwardly the Spanish conquest maintained, commerce was siowly drifting into alien hands. Canadians, hardy and thrifty, were here. Americans also, their heads crammed with schemes for accelerating  trade. 

 Germans by the thousand, driven from the Fatherland by the great war. Italians out of sympathy with presentday government. These pioneers were moulding the envjronment to suit their needs, while each brought his traditions and his culture. 

 "The tSanra Lucia' landed us at Valparaiso  and from there the train carried us to the Capital of Chile, 

Santiago.                  

 (cMy first definite request to present the Baha'i Cause was at the Y. W. C. A. The proposal met with an instant response. The staff made all arrangements and when the afternoon arrived the hail was crowded with notables; the heads of the Sweet Memorial hospital and clinic; the directors of the Valparaiso  Y. M. C. A., the leaders of the literary societies as well as President of the college and ministers of various denominations. 

 Ivir. Mathews opened by reading a page from the tBahA'i Scriptures.' When he finished, the chairman asked him to read it again. 

 This request became the keynote of the occasion, lifting it beyond the ordinary  meeting and when the talk Widening Our Horizons' was finished, questions were asked from every part of the audience. It was already dark when we left the building; the whole afternoon had been filled with heavenly enthusiasm, so much so that we could scarcely credit the fact that we, the bearers of a new Message, had been so warmly received in this distant land. 

 "Immediate results followed, for both the head and secretary of the Soci6t6 de Femina became students of the Baha'i Cause. This little literary circle of thirty students studied literature in both Spanish and English  and it was therefore arranged that they should read tBaha'u'llih and the New Era' and cTh Goal of the New World Order' in Spanish and English. 

 "At length the time came when we bade farewell to our newfound friends, happy in the thought that in the Capital of Chile there would be a group studying the Cause. Study would augment capacity and in time an understanding of the principles of the New Civilization would draw these students to become part of the great program  of Baha'u'llah.

  "There are two ways of reaching the Argentine from Chile; the first is over the Andes, the route Martha Root had taken; the other skirting 

Chile and Patagonia.       

 We determined upon the southern route where no Baha'i had yet been. 

 From the south, winter was already enveloping the whole Antarctic region, sending icy winds northward over Patagonia. We decided, however,  to risk these hazards and go to the Argentine via the Chilean Lakes. 

 (tIn this remote land occurred a great spiritual experience, one of those meetings of the spirit that make social amenities pale by comparison. It happened that a German couple had come from Puerto Varas, Chile. Madame de 

Burnciuihl spoke English.  

 In whispers in the corner of the office we talked of the New World Order; as I unfolded  the Divine Plan she seemed to read it with me as from an open book. Each statement of mine was rounded out and completed by this clearsighted woman. 

 As I explained the simple form of our Administration and the station of the Guardian of the Cause, she repeated my words to her husband: ~Listen Gustave, we have a Guardian — one who holds the world together in this day — one who is preparing humanity for a new civilization.' 

 Very thoughtfully he turned the idea over in his mind and then replied in a deep voice, tYes yes, I can understand that. 

 It is as it should be — somewhere a spiritual leader must be making the plan that will guide us out of the wilderness and chaos of the pres-eat  into a new and better path.' 

 Madame de Burmuihi explained that they belonged to a large group of Germans who met and studied under the name of liberal Thought Society.' 

 But no more literature from the society was permitted in Germany, so as winter approached they were without material  for study. The Baha'i Revelation formed the link in the chain and they embraced  it eagerly and wholeheartedly. 

 They felt sure that the study group would accept it as they did. 

 ccBuenos Aires greeted us with a downpour  of cold rain. The stirring events of the Chilean trip, however, buoyed our spirits above temperature and filled our hearts with strong hope. 

 ttOpportunity came in the form of an invitation to address the Dramatic Society on the modern drama! I accepted. The afternoon came and dressed in my best I stepped upon my initial platform. The talk received widespread publicity and the daily papers carried the entire talk. This brought the editor of The Standard to interview  us. I confided to him my dilemma. He was so intrigued that he decided to study the Cause with me and investigate its truth for himself. After an intensive course of reading he was carried beyond journalistic impulses and there begin to appear in the columns of his paper references to the word Baha'i, its meaning, its origin and finally a two-column article on the history  of the movement from its inception. 

 "Giving a talk at the Spanish Club I had to employ an interpreter. 

 This was a veritable ordeal and I remembered how many times tAbdu'1 — Bah~ had passed through the ordeal of having His words redistributed by an alien tongue. 

 ~Frorn a variety of public talks there emerged certain personalities that made an indelible impression. 

 First in order of time was Miss Beer, a German from 

Africa's Gold Coast. Tragedies

 had rained down upon her ever since the 'World War. In an agony of spirit she had battered at the door of ancient theology, only to find herself shut out by dogmatic controversies. 

 From the first, she fell in iove with the Baha'i principles; she amassed a wealth of quotatiOns  from the Writings and studied by night as well as by day. After our third lesson she read a paper on the Baha'i Movement  before the German Literary Circle. As the inner commotion of soul subsided, she expressed a happiness that is impossible to describe. 

 CCA giant of undaunted courage was Sefiora Barrill. 

 Her husband had been a pioneer in Argentine finance and from his accumulated fortune had built a veritable palace of medieval splendor. 

 Then, suddenly,  she was left alone. It was at this period of her life that an awakening of soul occurred. All at once 'there flooded her being an inner consciousness that a new Message had come to earth, a Message, that would bind all religions together. She


<p50>
50              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  closed the palace and started forth in search of that which her heart foretold. But everywhere she went she encountered creeds, old and new. Saddened by failure she journeyed homeward. 

 ~     gave a talk at the Y. NV. C. A. on the union of all races, religions and creeds. Though understanding no English she came, to hear it, with her niece as interpreter. All during the talk I could see that she was in a state of agitation; she clasped and unclasped  her hands continuously. As soon as I finished she beckoned me. tAll over the world I have been seeking the treasure that you have now placed in my hands this afternoon. tThe New World Order' that you have explained, has been ringing in my heart for many a long day.' Often when we sat together before the fire she would cry out CLet us go spread the good news —  let us tramp the world over.' And though well over seventy, as we left she was preparing to depart on a world crusade. 

 c(Another wonderful friendship was formed with a distinguished Argentine fain-ily  that we had met on the train from Baha'u'llah. There were a widow, her daughters and a niece. They came to hear me speak and presently we found ourselves being entertained by the most hospitable of people. 

 We saw gardens copied from the palaces of Europe, where roses grew as high as young fruit trees, beds of lotus in bloom, white and tranquil beside marble pools. Everywhere were rare tropical plants gathered  from the far-off islands of the Pacific. One day, while Seiiorita Lavarello and I were driving, she remarked, tYou remind me of someone I met in Geneva — a woman all spirit.' Naturally I asked her name. tLady Bloomfield,' she replied, like you she is a Baha'i. 

 It is strange how much this religion attracts me, but I know it is not for me, for should I approach it ever so secretly, the family would know and every member of the clan would arise to save me from Hell that they would see yawning to receive me; — you have no idea of the power of Spanish traditions — the Rock of Gibraltar  is a weak defense by comparison — I would be immediately surrounded by an ecclesiastical conference that would go on forever and ever.' twelli I replied, laughing, ing, Cjf the picture you have painted is even half true, I think you better come to the United States where no one will be inter-~sted  in your beliefs, nor take heed of the ideas you harbor beneath your charming curls.' So we planned that she should come in the autumn and I pray that this free sod may come under the Baha'i training that will develop, without curtailing, her lovely spirit. 

 ttTh visit to Buenos Aires that in the beginning had been fraught with dark difficulty,  terminated in great enthusiasm for the Baha'i Principles. Alas, that a rigid code prevented joining my pupils together; nevertheless, as I stood on the deck of the steamer that was carrying us to Brazil, I felt that group consciousness would be the natural consequence of Baha'i study and would come about as a result of it. 

    CJ~ Rio, Leonora Holsapple 

 joined us. She had come following Martha Root's notable  visit to South 

America. Settling in Baha 

 (which in Spanish means bay), she had set herself the task of mastering Spanish and Portuguese, while earning her living in a city directly over the equator. Encouraged by our Guardian, she translated and published tBaM'u'llAh and the New Era' and other volumes, thus making an Outstanding contribution for all time to the Baha Cause. 

 "Through the influence of this true Baha'i friend, we were able to form a class without delay. 

 These people were sufficiently evolved to draw together for study and to meet often. A second class soon followed the first through important Americans to whom we had brought letters. The members of this class enabled me to place Baha'i books in the circulating libraries. 

 ttj spoke on the prophecies fulfilled by the Baha'i Religion and gave a short outline of the Bib, Baha'u'llah and cAbdu~1~Bah~. Their reception of the talk impressed us all. It was evident that there existed a strong spiritual tie between us and some day this will be cemented. 

 From that moment they did all in their power to help us spread the Baha'i Message and surrounded us with every kindness. 

 tcThrough Miss Holsapple's influence I spoke at the 

Educational League. This

  portant committee controls the education of Brazil as well as the reading matter that goes to schools and libraries. Religion may not be spoken from their platform but the breadth of the Cause gave ample opportunity  to outline education from its spiritual standpoint. 

 I also addressed the Y. W. C. A. that throughout the journey had treated our mission with so much cordiality. 

 ~tWC were invited to spend an evening with the Sufis to address their members. 

 As far as we could learn, they were not connected with the Sufis of fran. 

 The movement  had been brought from India to London  and its leaders, Mr. and Mrs. Cecil Best, were English. The pamphlets describing the belief seemed subjective in character though broad and humanitarian in design. 

 CCJ~ retrospect it is impossible to number the individuals that crossed our path during this voyage of five months. Constantly we were meeting strangers and constantly telling them of the purpose of our visit. By land and by sea, over thousands of miles, the Cause was heralded and its dynamic news spread." 

 Less than a year after this journey by Mr. and Mrs. Mathews, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley  1W. Blakeley started from New York on a journey to another part of South America, leaving on March 6, 1936 and returning toward the end of April. 

 The points visited were Haiti, La Guayra, Cura§ao, Porto Cabello, Cuanto, Puerto de Sucre, Curapano, 

Trinidad and Georgetown.  

 While the journey was taken primarily for reasons of scientific research, the spiritual  intention of seizing the opportunity to promote the Faith of Baha'u'llah in new lands and among new peoples was no less vital; and indeed, the story of this most interesting and effective mission means above all the fact that Baha'is, under all circumstances,  have a supreme aim which they cgn fulfil amid the ordinary conditions of life as laymen, and which requires no special ecclesiastical office or distinction. 

 Georgetown was their objective, and the place where the most active Baha'i teaching was carried on. The journey itself, however,  afforded unique opportunities for personal  contacts and friendships in which ex planations of the Faith and its literature could be given. A radio talk at Trinidad, B. W. I., was reproduced in the local press, and the Blakeleys found many receptive hearts. 

 At Georgetown, Mr. and Mrs. Blakeley found themselves in a civilization partly Dutch and partly English in character, with a colony of East Indians whose members proved most receptive. 

 By public lectures, two series of radio addresses, and the publication of these ad. dresses in The Daily Chronicle, Mrs. Blake-ley  succeeded beyond her expectation in establishing a real and friendly interest in the new World Order. 

 One series was known as ~The Voice of Peace," the other had the title of "The ROle of Religion and Science in Modern 

Civilization."             

 The lecture on ~tTh Unity of Man," delivered  before the East Indian Associ~tion, led to the formation of a study class. Other lectures were requested by the Moravian Church and local members of the Masonic order. 
                           
      SUMMER SCHOOLS             

  The rise of permanent educational institutions throughout the Baha'i world marks a definite turning point in the progress of the Faith. 

 This turning point can most briefly be defined as the transformation of the content of the phrase ttBh''~ teacher" from its first meaning of public speaker to the new concept of educator, or teacher in the organic sense. The transition has been from the plane of personal feeling to that of conscious knowledge. 

 During the era when the Faith was promoted  by believers touched by its spirit but incompletely informed of its teachings, it was inevitable that the active worker should consider "teaching" as exhortation more than instruction, as an appeal to enter a new Kingdom of Mystery rather than education in a universal science or art of the soui. The well of feeling was necessarily drawn upon to suppiy every lack of organized knowledge, particularly in view of the fact that the new Revelation was regarded more as a personal experience than as the basis of a world commonwealth. The influence of


<p52>
52              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the preaching habits of the professional reli-gionists in the prior religious environment also had its strong but unconscious effect, at least in the West. Moreover, the Faith disclosed no visible and immediate relation to the progress of human destiny as a whole, for in those days the Baha'is were as worshippers in the catacombs of a proud city which ignored their existence or despised their belief. The world above and about them still moved under an impetus which apparently had no dependence upon the Word of God. 

 Through the instrumentality of their Summer Schools, concentrating a trend already  beginning to be apparent in the larger and more experienced local centers, the Baha'is about ten years ago began to face the fact that their Sacred Scriptures offered all the elements of a spiritual university and not alone the intoxication of a new and purer wine. The personal testimony of faith, the practice of seif-revealment, the sharing of individual states of feeling, the standard of ttteaching" in the infancy of collective Baha'i experience, began steadily to retreat before the new standard attempting to safeguard the tiight of love in the glass of knowledge." The educator assumed the place long held by the exhorter, without sacrificing the inner reality of consecration and reverence upon which faith depends. The environment of the Baha'is had changed from tAbdu'1-Bah6.'s concentration upon individuals to the Guardian's concentration upon the community, and the rise of the Baha'i educational institutions is the signal of this change. 

 By now the moving and evolving spirit of the Baha'i community realizes the distinction  between the Ccteacher~~ who possesses kn~w1edge not encompassed •round about with personal emotion, and the "teacher" who in reality projects himself upon the group. 

  The Baha'i Summer School  

 today, for all its brief duration and informality and modest  equipment, offers definite courses of instruction  and requires the attitude of the student on the part of those who attend. Its class leaders have prepared themselves by research and reflection, attested in the outlines each has prepared for his course. 

 They have not come to preach but to inform. 

 In the reports prepared by the various School committees the vitality of their spirit of knowledge is clearly portrayed. 

 As the modern university had its beginning in the new body of knowledge available after the influence of Muhammad had reversed the anti-rational attitude of the Christians in Europe, so these Baha'i Schools contain the germ of all future education, and in their fulfilment will be instruments for the diffusion of a universal truth unknown in any previous

        Green Acre                

 1934 ecTh Green Acre Summer School for the 1934 season began its organized courses on Monday, July 9th, and courses continued in session five mornings a week for seven weeks. 

 ccTh first two weeks were devoted to a careful study of the ~KitTh-i-fqin.' 

 Those who were in attendance felt that they gained much added insight into this book of Baha'u'llah's. 

 Mrs. Greenleaf was particularly helpful in the way in which she linked the Teachings of the fqin with the present problems and needs of the Baha'i Faith. 

 ccTh third week consisted of five lectures given by Miss Mary Maxwell on Nabil's Narrative, tThe Dawn Breakers.' 

 In this series, Miss Maxwell narrated the story of all the important happenings in the life of the Bib and His followers, and thus gave a most dramatic and inspiring review of this remarkable book. 

 It seems certain that no person who had not previously read tThe Dawn Breakers' could have heard these lectures without making a resobre to immediately  begin to read the whole Narrative. 

 "During the fourth week Dr. tAli Kuli Khin gave a series of lectures on some of the Tablets of Baha'u'llah, which are most difficult for the Occidental Baha'i to understand.  He explained much of the tr~nian symbolism used, corrected some mis-transla-tions,  and added greatly to our spiritual appreciation of these majestic Tablets. 

The following Tablets     
were discussed by Dr.

  Khin during this week: tThe Tablet of the Virgin'; the ~Tab16t of the Holy Mariner'; the ~Tab1et of Wisdom'; 'The Discourse on the Temple'; tThe Seven 

Valleys'; tThe Four Valleys.'

 "The topic of the fifth week's course was CHOW can the individual meet the spiritual conflicts of the modern world?' 

 with Dr. Genevieve Coy as leader of discussion. 

 The purpose of this course was to aid Baha'is in meeting some of the spiritual conflicts within  their own lives, and also to provide means for greater understanding of the spiritual problems one meets in teaching the 

Baha'i Faith.              

 "The sixth course, taught by Mr. David Hofman, was entitled cProposed Solutions of the Economic Problem Compared with the Baha 

Economic Program." In      

 clear and simple language which could be understood by the listener with no background of study of Economics, Mr. Hofman presented  the basic ideas involved in Technocracy, Communism, Capitalism, etc. The course was concluded by a discussion of the economic provisions of the World Order of Baha'u'llah, and showed in what ways the Baha'i Program provides strength at points in which the other solutions were weak. 

 "During the seventh week of the Summer  School Mr. Horace Holley presented important points concerning ~The 

World Order of Baha'u'llah.'

 In a twenty-minute introductory talk each day, Mr. Holley discussed  ways in which the individual Baha'i may most usefully relate his life to the World Order. This talk was followed by readings from the World Order Letters of Shoghi Effendi. The morning's session was concluded by a round table discussion of points related to the Introductory talk and the readings. This course drew a large audience, who were very appreciative of Mr. Holley's stimulating presentation of both the material and spiritual aspects of our participation in the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

  1935 "During the first week of the Green Acre Summer School, July 812, Prof. Glenn 

Shook and Mr. Louis Gregory

 each gave two lectures, and Dr. Stanwood Cobb gave one lecture in the regular morning class period, from 11:00 to 12:30. The topics considered in their discussion were cJmmorta1ity~ ~Prayer' and ~Prophecy.' 

 "During the second week of the session, Dr. Cobb gave a very helpful course in which he reviewed his own book, tSecurity for a Failing World,' as well as tThe Promise of All Ages,' by Christophil, and then showed how these books can be used in teaching the Baha'i Faith. 

 "The third course was given by Prof. Shook, on tMysticism and the Baha'i Teaching.'  Prof. 

 Shook had prepared a very valuable  outline to accompany this course, an which he used Riihi Effendi's tMW and the Baha'i Revelation' as the basic reading. 

 Topics covered included the following:  the conflict between mind ama heart, the nature of mysticism, and the fundamental  difference between mysticism and prophetic religion. 

 "The leader who had been scheduled for the fourth course was unable to come to Green Acre and the morning meetings that week were given to prayer and meditation, with various friends as leaders. 

 ttDuring the fifth week, four different leaders took charge of the work. 

 Mr. Emeric Sala led two discussions on the topics, tA New Aspect of Religion' and tA Theocratic Democracy.' 

 The speakers and topics for the three remaining days were as follows: — Mrs. 

Rosemary Sala, CA Twofold Consciousness';
Mr. Saffa Kinney, tSpiritu-ality'; 

Miss Louise Wright, ~Th    
Reality of Man.'           

 "The course for the sixth week was led by Dr. Genevieve Coy, and the topic for discussion was CRil Likenesses and 

Differences:  the Scientific

 Evidence and the Baha'i Teaching.' The purpose of this course was to provide Baha'i teachers with scientific material with which to meet the arguments of non-Bahi'is who maintain that the oneness of mankind is impossible because of racial differences. 

 "The seventh course on tThe Origin, 

Powers and Conditions      

 of Man' was led by Mr. Alfred Lunt, and used sections of tSome Answered Questions' as the basic text. Mr. Lunt discussed very helpfully such topics as: the true place of man in the universe;


<p55>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES              the human spirit as a divine trust, and gateway of eternal life. 

 ~tThe final course of the summer school was given by Mr. Horace Holley, on the topic tThe Most Great Peace.' The purpose of this course was to concentrate thought upon the Baha conception of and program of World Peace, in clear distinction to the conceptions and programs emanating from traditional religious and political sources.' Mr. Holley began the course with a valuable  historical summary of past efforts toward world peace, and concluded with a discussion of the 

CMost Great Peace of Baha'u'llah

 as Regeneration of Mankind, and as Transformation of Society.' 

 (cThe largest average attendance at the courses was during the last two weeks, — 44 and 43, respectively. 

 The number of different people attending during these two weeks was 80 for the seventh course and 73 for the last course. 

 tcTh weekend conferences were held during the summer 

: — Teaching Conference, July

 57; Amity Conference, August 1718; Youth Conference, 

August 242 5.             

 CCOne of the most valuable aspects of life at Green Acre is the informal discussion which goes on wherever the friends meet in small groups. 

 Such discussions were frequent during the summer of 1935, and those who shared in them found them unusually inspiring. Interested non-Bah&is often joined in these small groups, and thus had an opportunity to learn more of the Baha'i teachings. We were especially happy in having a number of such guests at the Inn, some of whom have already joined Baha'i communities. 

 "Green Acre was especially fortunate in having R~hi Effendi as a visitor for ten days at the end of the summer. He was a valuable member of the last course of the season, and many of the students found in his two dynamic evening lectures the highest point of the summer's work.

  1935 

CCThe Western States Summer

 School, held at Bosch Place, Geyserville, July 14th to 27th, 1935, was one of the best sessions ever held. 

 "It was opened by the usual Unity Feast, under the tBig Tree,' at noon, July 14th, attended by some 225 people. A true spirit of unity and devotion marked the opening of the School at the Feast, and continued throughout all the sessions. The attendance at the School meetings for the adults averaged  90. There were representatives present from Canada, England, Transylvania, Tahiti, China, Honolulu, Jamaica, and an American Indian. 

 (rMost of the people were housed in the buildings on the Bosch Place, while a goodly number camped on the grounds, and others secured lodgings in the city. 

 'tln the conduct of the school, a definite objective of the Committee has been to improve  the presentation of subjects, and the development at the same time of Baha'i Teachers. 

 Thus during the courses there were 19 different Baha'is who took part in


<p56>
56               THE BAHA'I WORLD

 the lectures. Each one was required to prepare himself well in advance, and have the subject outlined and condensed, so as to take up not over 30 or 35 minutes at the most. 

 Two years ago a College Professor we had give a few lectures, remarked to me, that he did not see why we secured the assistance of College Professors, as our presentations were better than they could hope to do. 

 t(A1L classes are conducted on the creative discussion plan. The speaker introduces the subject with his detailed presentation in not over 35 minutes; then a period of 10 to 15 minutes is allowed for questioning and discussion.  The third class of the day was even more of a creative discussion meeting, dealing with the Fundamental Baha'i Principles.  In this class the leader used not over 20 minutes to present the subject, allowing 25 to 30 minutes for questioning and discussion.  Of outstanding interest was the course on the Influence of IsUm and the Teachings of Muhammad, the first on Isl6m to be given in an American 

Baha'i Summer School.       

 ttThere were four roundtable discussion meetings, held in one of the beautiful Redwood  Groves, which developed enthusiasm and clearer understanding among all present, of the important subjects under consideration. 

 "Children's classes were held daily. One class was for those under 7 years of age, the other for those younger. All young people over 13 were permitted to attend the Adult Classes or the classes for those young people between 7 and 13. There were in attendance in all 53 young people, of which over 20 were non-Bah4'is. Attached is detailed report of the Children's and Youth Program Committee, outlining the method of conduct, supervision of both study and play, and details of the courses of study. 

 "Three public teaching meetings were held; one with the local Grange at Geyser-yule,  which is usually attended by all the officers of the Grange, the members of the Chamber of Commerce, city dignitaries, etc.; the second, a general publid meeting in the city of Geyserville; and the third, an afternoon public meeting at the 

Griffith Grove, near Santa 

 Rosa, in the beautiful outdoor amphitheater there. 

 These meetings  were all very well attended, and great interest aroused in the Faith. 

 ttrne citizens of Geyserville are becoming more kindly to the Baha'is all the time. Originally they were quite opposed to us, because of our Faith, Geyserville being an orthodox city. They even went so far as to warn certain of their people to beware of the Baha'is and their tpernicious teachings.' 

 This was four or live years ago. It is of interest to note in passing, that the two particular Geyservillians, warned to be careful of the Baha'is, have both become Baha'is. The newspaper giving full page announcement of the Summer School and an announcement by the Chamber of Commerce extending a hearty welcome to the Summer School, shows the spirit of fellowship that has been developed. 

 This has been possible only through strict adherence to Baha'i conduct, which changed distrust into trust and confidence. 

 "The 1935 program follows, together with the names of those who conducted the various classes:

Child Training at Geyserville

  The following description of the program for children, maintained at the Geyserville Summer School, has been prepared by Mary Walker, recreational director in 1933 and 1935. 

 CCAlthough the school was originally founded for adults, children and youth have their place in the program, and it is these two groups which will be considered in this account. 

  "A brief description of the physical setup up for the children may help to clarify the picture of this phase of the program. 

 ttCl for instruction in the Baha'i teachings are conducted around one large table in a one-room building, bounded on three sides by the outdoor play area. The play area most used is in the shade of a large tree. A small plot of grass provides space for circle games and story-hours for the young children. Several long tables and benches are used for games and handcrafts. A sand pile is also included in the play area. 

 "For class instruction, the children sit on benches along both sides of the table, and are supplied with pencils and paper, for the construction of notebooks. These classes are conducted by adults with knowledge of both the Baha'i teachings and educational psychology. 

 They are approximately one hour in length, and include a story, some memory work, and a little picture drawing in connection with the general iesson. 

 "Notebooks are kept by each child and additions to them are made daily. 

 Hence, at the end of the two weeks, there is a permanent  record of the entire set of lessons, and each child's accomplishments in connection  with the lessons. A good deal of effort goes into the construction of these little booklets, and, in many cases, they are among the most treasured possessions of their owners. When a particularly fine piece of work is done, there is recognition for this achievement in the form of a gold star given. 

 It is interesting to note the enthusiasm resulting from such a recognition  — small as it is. CCSince the physical development of each individual is recognized as a necessary requisite for a full and worthwhile life, recreation and physical activities are important in the summer school program. 

 C(The director tries to divide her time for the supervision of recreation as equally as possible into three groups — those for the very young children, the older children, and the youth group. 

 "The recreation period for the young children follows the class lesson in the morning, and includes simple circle games, stories, songs, short walks, simple handcrafts  and sand pile constructions. 

 t~The children of this group range in age


<p58>
58              THE  BAHA'I  WORLD

  from about three years to seven years. Aside from the pure enjoyment derived from the abovementioned activities, there is, for each one, a practical educational justification. 

 The circle games provide big-muscle  activity, and are especially important for the correct and normal growth and development of the child. Stories exercise the imagination, assist in the development of a young child's vocabulary, and often illustrate an important moral or social principle, which aids in character development.  (The writer does not, however, believe that every child's story must have a moral.) 

 ccTh singing and learning of songs helps in the musical and rhythmical ability of the child, which will be a source of enjoyment throughout life. 

 "Handcrafts assist in the development of intricate neuromuscular coordinations, necessary for poise and various skills such as writing, drawing, and so forth. 

 Short observation walks help to enlarge the general fund of information, and an appreciation  of the natural surroundings, to say nothing of the child's physical strength. Construction in the sand pile increases intricate  neuromuscular coordinations, and imagination. 

 Tunnels, highways, bridges, and castles of sand are real and important objects of construction in the minds and the eyes of little children. 

 "However, all of these activities emphasize, mainly, the social development of the child — a desire and an ability to work and play with others. No adjustment, aside from normal physical growth and development, is more important than this one of a social nature, for the child who learns and practices the habits of fair-play and congenial give and take will find his place in the world, and will be accepted into society by his fellow men much more readily than if his habits were of a less desirable nature. 

 Th older children have a recreational program somewhat similar to that of the younger ones, although it is a good deal more complicated. These children range in age from seven to thirteen years. Games of higher organization are substituted for simple circle games. Stories and construction  in the sand pile are almost entirely eliminated, and the songs and handcrafts are of a more difficult nature. 

 ~tIn the afternoon, there is supervised recreational swimming, as well as instructiOn  in swimming, diving, and lifesaving methods for the youth and older children's group. At the same time, a story hour is conducted for the smaller children. 

 ~tIn the evening, the recreational program is primarily planned for the youth group, although a few of the older children enjoy participation in the activities. These include  campfires and Csings,~ social games, social dancing, and evening walks. It will be noticed that the activities are mainly of a social character. 

 These are necessary for a well-rounded life, and are included because they are the activities in which the youth of today derives a great deal of pleasure. 

 ccSocial behavior of the highest type is expected and maintained, and where instruction  is necessary, it is provided. The music for the dances and tsings' is furnished  by members of the youth group, and is of a remarkably high calibre. 

 ~~Geyservi1le and the surrounding country offer a splendid setting for delightful evening  walks. 

 As large a group as twenty or twenty-five young people enjoys this type of activity during the long summer eve-flings.  Singing is very popular with this group, and is remarkably well done. Several campfires around which community singing is led are enjoyed during the two-weeks' period. 

 ccThe members of the youth group meet with the adults for lectures and discussions on the various phases of the Baha'i teachings during the morning hours. 

 This plan is probably not an ideal one, and it is possible  that an alteration may be made with an increase in the size of the summer school. 

 ttDuring the entire two-weeks' period, the young people are busily engaged in preparations for a large pageant in which all of the children and youth participate. The general theme is the promotion of international and interracial harmony and goodwill, and, although there is not time for the children to write the pageant, almost all of the other responsibilities are carried  by them. 

 These responsibilities include


<p59>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             59

  the playing of the various rOles — some thirty or forty in number, the selection and rendering of the music, the construction of stage settings, lights, and costumes; and assistance in directing the production. 

 This pageant has become something which is looked forward to with eagerness by all of the students of the summer school. 

 The outstanding feature is not, however, the production itself, but it is the sincerity with which each participant makes his contribution  to the whole affair. 

 cTh members of the summer school are given the opportunity of living in a most broadening and thought-stimulating cosmopolitan  group. All stages of financial and economic conditions are found. 

 Many races and nations are represented, and all ages have a place. 

 There is an unmistakable spirit of sincere and joyous good-fellowship and cooperation prevalent at all times. 

 It would be difficult to find a happier community. 

 (!Could any group of people — young or old —  — be trained and educated in a more ideal situation? 

 Could any community be more wholesome, or more conducive to international, interracial, and interciass harmony? 

 ttCertainly the opportunities of these young Baha'i s — their background and training — are rare treasures to be cherished and shared now and in future years. 
                           
      LOUHELEN RANCH             
 Seasons of 1934 and 1935   

   CcTh Central States Summer 

 School had its beginning in the summer of 1931 when, in the month of August, some score of Baha'is and their friends gathered at Lou-helen  Ranch to study intensively for nine days the teachings of Baha'u'llah and to spread the teachings in the surrounding country. Louhelen Ranch is the name given to the farm owned by Mr. and Mrs. L.     W. Eggleston of Detroit. 

 It is a beautiful  stretch of rolling land containing stream, ravine, woods, open fields and pasture  and situated in eastern Michigan near the little village of Davison and oniy ten miles from the city of Flint. The leaders of the classes that summer were Mr. and Mrs. Howard Ives and Mr. and Mrs. Harlan Ober. 

 A marked spirit of harmony and a spiritual atmosphere seemed to pervade the place from the beginning and has been in evidence each summer since, while a steady growth in attendance and interest has taken place which would seem to belie the small and almost unnoticed beginning. 

 (cEli year Mr. and Mrs. Eggleston have generously added buildings and other equipment  to the original plant until now there are comfortable summer accommodations for about one hundred people besides an auditorium and a recreation hail. 

 "The outstanding step forward in 1934 was the inauguration of a separate session for young people. 

 This idea really started with the young people themselves who had asked the previous summer that they might have a session all their own the next summer.  Their joyous enthusiasm did not wane and for four days, June 2528, they proved to those in charge that in the hands of tomorrow  s adults lies a real gift to our beloved Cause. The daily program follows: CCThe Principles of Baha'u'llah,

 ccCounselors for the young people who guided, advised, and helped in plans were Mrs. 

Dorothy Baker and Stanley  

 Mason. Mrs. Baker conducted the devotional period each morning. There was a resident attendance  of about forty, and others who were present for a day or more made about sixty who contacted the teachings. Most of these came from Baha'i families but there were a few who learned of the teachings for the first time and who since this first knowledge  have constantly grown in their love and zeal for the Cause. 

 "The classes, with the exception of the one by James McCormick which was held right after supper, were held in the morn


<p60>
60              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ing. This left the afternoons largely free for recreation or for group discussions and private interviews of deep import to those concerned. 

 Programs of a more or less serious nature were arranged for the evenings by a committee of young people. 

 "The importance of this definite beginning  of a distinct youth conference cannot be overestimated. 

 May its growth, through the power of the Spirit, be unbounded and its influence in establishing the World Order of Baha'u'llah be unlimited. 

 ~~Many young people remained through the general session which covered nine days, July 30-July 8. June 30 was registration day with a program of welcome, inspiration, and fellowship in the evening, and on the remaining eight days the following program was carried out: "Devotions — Leader selected.

Ford.                     

 Baha'i Teachings and the Bible, Mrs. Shahnaz Waite. 

  ttEach afternoon a public lecture was given. The evening programs were varied and required less concentration. Often there were stories of Haifa, tAkkA and the Master. 

 Sometimes there was group singing.  Two evenings directed by the young people were given over to Temple inspiration. 

 tcThis was the first summer a special course on Baha'i Administration had been given and the interest was noteworthy. The opportunity for questions and discussions seemed to satisfy a widely felt need and to indicate a growing consciousness that each individual is a member of and each local community a unit in Baha'u'llah's World 

Order.                    

 CCThe summer of 1935 showed expansion in that three sessions instead of two were held. The attendance increased and there was sustained interest and enthusiasm. The youth session covered the dates June 2427 inclusive. 

 Fifty-seven young people were in daily attendance as residents besides about thirty visitors for a day or more. As far as we know this is the largest group of Baha'i youth ever gathered in a f our-day  conference in this country. They were eager, enthusiastic, happy. Their daily morning program was: "Devotions, Mrs. Dorothy 

Baker.                    

 The Baha'i Approach to World Problems,  Mrs. 

Ruth Brown.               
 The Baha'i Life, Mrs.     

Baker.                    

 World Order Letters of The Guardian, — Forum conducted by one of the young people. 

  "As previously, the afternoons were free for games or sports or whatever one chose. It was noticeable that many chose to devote a part of each afternoon to quiet group discussions sometimes with one of the teachers and sometimes by themselves. The evenings, too, as formerly were in charge of a young peopie's committee which chose to devote a part of each evening to serious subjects. 

 tThe time is so short,' they said, 'that it seems a pity not to have something really worth while in the evening.' 

 One evening was devoted to a teaching conference under the leadership of Dale Cole, regional representative of the 

Teaching Committee. Great 

 enthusiasm was shown, many questions were asked, and valuable suggestions were made. 

 "On the Sunday preceding the youth session Madame Orlova gave two inspiring talks and many were on hand to hear her. Monday, too, she spoke in the afternoon, but was called back to Chicago before the youth session closed. Later she returned and her afternoon talks were a source of attraction during the general session. 

 ttDr. Lenore Morris was counselor and general assistant at this session for the young people. 

 t~The general session followed the youth session with one day intervening and a few of the youth remained for this session. About fifty-five were registered for full time or for more than a day. There were three regular courses and an address in the afternoon designed especially for those who come in from outside and know little of the Cause. The nine-day program (June 29-July 7) follows:

  "An unusually high spiritual and scholarly  standard was maintained in all these courses and they dovetailed into each other as though they had been worked out in consultation. 

 "According to custom the afternoons were free for visiting, discussion, swimming,  games and other recreation except for the public talk which was given by Madame Orlova or one of the teachers. The evening programs were varied and of a more or less serious nature. 

One evening Madame Orion   

 gave a beautiful talk on the Baha'i House of Worship. This led to voluntary offerings which were sent as a special gift to the national treasurer. 

 Two other evenings Madame Orlova spoke on other subjects or gave readings. 

One eve-fling  Frank Warner

 of Lima told us about his trip to Haifa, illustrating his talk by pictures he had taken while there. 

 The true spirit of the Master's house and the Holy Shrines seemed to pervade the atmosphere  at that time. At another evening gathering stories of Haifa and tAbdu'1-Bahi  were told. 

 Community games and singing helped us to get acquainted the first evening. The talk which Mr. Cobb gave about the Turk at one of these evening gatherings helped to make us understand and appreciate the fine qualities of these brothers. 

 "The first afternoon and evening were given over to a teaching conference led by Dale Cole. The exchange of ideas and sug.-gestions  was stimulating. 

 CCAt the third session, which was h~id August 1925, the plan was the same as for the other general session. The daily attendance  averaged from twenty to twenty-five and there was keen interest throughout. Many came daily from the nearby city of Flint so that forty or fifty people were reached in this session. 

 The daily program was: CCDtiLd selected. 

  Foundations of the N~w World Order, Carl Schefiler. 

  The Origin and Powers      
of Man, Dr. Lenore Morris. 

 C(Public afternoon talks and varied eve-fling programs were maintained as in the other sessions. 

 On two evenings we were entertained by groups from Flint. 

 One of these was a group of colored friends and a number of the regular attendants were colored. 

 The presence of Mrs. True gave a special inspiration for she shared with us her recent experiences at Haifa and messages from Shoghi Effendi. An evening devoted to the Temple resulted in a further offering to the national fund. 

 ccMore publicity was given to the school this summer than before. A fine feature article in the Flint Journal is worthy of especial mention. This summer school has made a very definite connection with the city of Flint and two or three carloads of people came out every day to morning, afternoon, or evening meetings. 

 A vigorous  and growing Baha'i community is developing in Flint as a result of the school. To the young people of this group the school is much indebted for their activities and help. 

 "Besides this outstanding result of the summer school we believe the school is having  an influence which it is difficult, even impossible, to estimate, There is a real spreading of the knowledge of the Cause and the individuals who attend surely gain in the depth and amount of their knowledge.  The courses are intensive. 

 A great deal of ground is gone over, but the interest has been sustained throughout and the attendance almost one hundred per cent of those enrolled. 

 There has been a distinct spirit of happiness, hope, and courage in all the sessions. 

 More than one has said that be, or she, came tired and discouraged and went away with hope and vision and desire to work. The meeting together of Baha'is from different communities has a distinct value in increasing understanding and unity. A good many new people have become interested in the Cause as a result of the school. 

 Our aim is to follow the in


<p62>
structions of Shoghi Effendi in widening the range and consolidating the foundations of this school year by year. 

 c~Besides these sessions reported the school is open throughout the season to casual inquirers  or to those who wish to spend a quiet vacation or to Baha'i groups for a day's outing. During the past summer Mr. and Mrs. Dale Cole made the ranch their headquarters and Mrs. Cole was in constant residence. More and more it is the hope that this will be a center from which there is a constant flow of the teachings and spirit of

     CONFERENCE OF BAHA'I STUDENTS AT
PARIS                      

  During the past six years, an annual conference has been held in Paris which gathers together for discussion and study a number of students attending various universities in Europe, all of whom are ckclared Baha'is. 

 An interesting account of the conference held December 29 and 30, 1935, has been furnished by the committee, through Mr. M. Hakim. This statement, in the original French, follows: (CNO sommes tr~s heureux d'informer ceux auxquels nous avons envoy6 'a 

Convocation  du 15 Novembre

 dernier que la 6~me Conf6rence annuelle des Etudiants Baha'is a eu lieu les 29 et 30 D6cernbre 1935, chez Mine. 

 Scott, dans La pius grande joic a sinc6ritd. 

 C(En effet, conform6ment au d&ir supreme de tAbd'lBh' de r6aliser 1'union de 1'Est et de l'Ouest par 1'interm6diaire de la jeunesse, notre ami Monsieur Rochan a eu 1'id6e ii y a cinq ans, en 1931, d'organiser ~ Paris la premi&e Conf6rence. 

 (CAinsi chaque ann6e, nos amis se r6unis-sent pendant la p6riode des vacances urn-versitaires du nouvel an, et cette ann6e comme les ann6es pr&z6dentes, avec l'appro-bation de notre Gardien Shoghi 

Effendi, notre 6~me Conf6rence
a eu lieu.                 

 ccPendant les deux jours, 60 personnes furent pr6sentes. 

 Parmi nos amis, nous aVOfls Cu iC grand plaisir d'avoir Madame Maxwell, fondatrice de Ia Cause ~i Paris, qui &ait venue en France spdcialement pour cette r6union, et Mademoiselle Lidja Zamen-hof;  on connait la valeur et Ic na6rite de son p&e, Monsieur Zamenhof, le cr6ateur de Ia langue esperanto. Ii fut 6galement tr~s agr6able pour nous de voir Monsieur Zabib, venant de Lyon ob, depuis deux ans, ii r~ussit ~ former le premier groupe Baha'i de cette yule. 

 "Plusieurs amis de province a de l'&ranger nous ont exprim~ leur regret de ne pouvoir assister ~ Ia Confdrence et nous ont souhait~ succ~s et aide spirituelle. 

 CCLe premier jour, apr~s une pri&e, Monsieur  Kennedy, Pr6sident de 1'Asscmbke Spirituelle de Paris, souhaita Ia bienvenue puis dQnna La parole i Monsieur Hakim, Secr6taire des Etudiants Baha'is, qui remer-cia  les personnes pr6sentes, 1'Assembl6e Spirituelle de Paris, et donna lecture de 1'ordre du jour. 

 CCMi Chahidzadeh traita avec conscience  le premier point: tL'histoire des religions  et leur rapport avec le Bahi'isme.' Ii d~montra que le besoin d'une religion retrouve ~ travers ics ages et dans les civilisations les plus diverses, et que le Bah6'isme a le caract~re universel n6cessaire pour rapprocher les hommes de toutes races et croyances. 

 "Ensuite, Monsieur Dehkan, avec son doquence habituelle, parla du second point: cL~Education Baha'i, base de la Paix Mon-diale.' 

 En larges traits ii montra, d'une part Ic parti-pris, d'autre part les probkmes vitaux non r6solus qui emp6chent Ic monde de sortir du cercie infernal des guerres, puis comment le BaM'isme apporte l'esprit de communaut6 mondiale ndcessaire ~t une base durable de Paix. 

 c~AprAs ces deux causeries notre premi&e journ6e prenait fin, et rendezvous fut pris pour Je lendemain. 

 "Le Lundi 30 D6cembre, toujours devant un auditoire assez nombreux, notre ami Monsieur Mesbah traita avec profondeur de 'rue Ia question suivante: tConnais-toi toi-m~me (Socrate).' Ii expliqua comment, pour tout &re, ii est essentiel de connaitre ses limires et ses possibilit6s et si par sa volont~ ii se tourne vers Ia source de v6rit~, Dieu, ii pourra donner ~ ses actes une haute portdc morale et bienfaisante. 

 ttApr~s une biive discussion sur ce sujet, Madame Maxwell parla pendant un quart d'heure de l'activit~ de la jeunesse amen-Caine  a canadienne pour Ia Cause. Puis on commen~a ~ traiter Ic point de 1'ordre du jour relatif ~ un 6change de vues sur tLes meilleurs Moyens de r6pandre Ic Bahi'isme' et on envisagea tour ~ tour: I'exemple donn6 par la vie, les publications, les r&inions, les voyages et correspondances, etc. Malheu-reusement  Ic temps s'avanqant, on ne put donner que trois quarts d'heure ~ ce sujet. 

 "Avant de terminer on fit une distribution de ijyres Baha'is, de photos du Maitre, de bagues grav~es offertes par 

Madame Dreyfus-Barney      
et Miss Sanderson.

 ttApr~s ces deux jours de r6union, nous avons senti la v4rivable intimit~ qui exis-tait  entre ces diff6rentes personnes de 1'Ouest et de 1'Est dunies sous le nom de Baha'u'llah, Ct nous 6tions tellement heureux que les Etudiants d'~cid&ent d'ex-primer  dans une lettre, leur joie et leur fidditS au Gardien Shoghi Effendi." 
                           
EXTENSION OF YOUTH ACTIVITY
                           
   During 1933, Shoghi Effendi

 extended the functions of the American Baha'i Youth Committee in the following words: "He would strongly urge you to cooperate, heart and soul, with all the various Assemblies, groups and committees throughout the Baha'i world, to ask for their assistance and help for the successful discharge of your duties and obligations, and in this way to try to build up an active and ready mind among the Baha'i youth throughout the world. 

 In other words, you should not confine  your activities to the national sphere but should strive to create under the supervision of your N. S. A. an international body of active young Baha'i men and women who, conscious of their manifold and sacred responsibilities, will unanimously arise to spread the Holy 'Word." 

 The period 19341936 has consequently represented a rapid development of world consciousness among the Baha youth of North America and the formation of plans more intensive in spirit and more widespread in scope. 

 As stated in the Youth Committee's annual  report for 19341935, "communication has been established with nineteen international groups representing fifteen nations, and with fifty-three local groups." That same year brought forth a 

CfBah4~i Youth Bulletin"   

 as the organ of the young people and also a number of study outlines aimed to bring the youth groups into closer touch with the Teachings as the solution of modern  problems. 

 The Committee's report a year later stated that the Bulletin had been transformed into a quarterly magazine entitled Baha'i Youth, that regional youth conferences had been held in America, that the young people were centering their energies on the three Baha'i Summer Schools, and that the first international nal Youth Day had been observed on March 21, 1936. 

 In Part Two of this volume appears an article summarizing the work of Baha'i Youth for the period of this survey, and reference should be made to that article. An important element underlying the formation  of Baha'i youth groups is the Teaching of Baha'u'llah, that the age of fifteen years brings the condition of maturity. Since the voting age of the Baha community  is twenty-one years, the young peo-pie between fifteen and twenty-one are assimilated into the community by permission to attend the Nineteen Day Feast after reporting to the Spiritual Assembly their acceptance of the Faith and their intention of applying for the full voting right on reaching the age of twenty-one. 

 Above all, the Baha'i youth group does not represent a "youth movement" in the sense that it is a revolt or separation from the older Baha'i community. The social pattern created by Baha'u'llah is universal; its establishment upon earth calls for every human quality and attribute — enthusiasm as well as wisdom, initiative as well as experience, and the moral and emotional virtues of youth not less than the characteristics of the older generation. 

 The Baha'i youth group of today undergoes training to become  the active Baha'i community of tomorrow. 

 This means nothing less than the fact that the inherent function of the Teachings, the creation of reality, has begun to proiect itself nearer the beginnings of spiritual experience as guidance and inspiration  for those who otherwise wouLd find their predominant social influence in the pressures of a divided world. 

 Since the first International Baha'i Youth Day marked a new stage in the progress of youth activity, it is fitting to conclude this brief reference with a statement on that event by the secretary of the Youth Committee  during 1934193 6, Miss Marion Holley. 
                           
International Baha'i Youth 
Day                        

  "Shoghi Effendi wrote the American Baha'i youth who had attended the 

Twenty-Eighth  Annual      

 Convention' as follows: tln 1 Through his secretary.


<p67>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES              67

 these days of universal affliction, of widespread disillusionment and discontent the eyes of the entire Baha'i world are directed towards the activities which the Baha'i youth are initiating in various countries with the view of hastening the unfoldment of the Divine Plan. Their hopes for a better and saner world center chiefly in you who have been called upon to vindicate through both your words and deeds those verities which alone can effectively establish unity and peace in the world.' 

    CCCetil the American Youth 

 Committee  had no hint of this new era of teaching which the Guardian was about to introduce when, in January, 1936, it determined to invite the Baha'i youth of the world to a joint celebration of Nawruz. 

 Nor did the local groups who responded so eagerly realize  the timeliness of their demonstration. Their intention was but to move one step nearer the goal which Shoghi Effendi had fixed for them, the goal ~w create an international body of active young Baha men and women. .' 

 It was their common thought that at Nawruz, the opening of a new year in the history of the Faith, they could most seriously celebrate their solidarity,  reaffirm their joint purpose, and create new modes for the expansion of their work. Thus, assisted by the American Youth Committee, an international program was adopted for Sunday, March 22, 1936, under the general title of Ba/9d'i Youth Look to the Future.

  CCG in fifteen nations were asked to participate and at the time of meeting it was not known exactly how many had planned to do so. Thus the cablegram sent to Shoghi Effendi overstated the number: CThirty regional conferences Baha'i youth fifteen nations greet beloved Guardian on Naw-R1iz, Beg prayers (for) confirma —  dons Baha'u'llah (on) first demonstration our ihternational unity.' 

 Actually there were twenty-six conferences reported, representing ten nations of the world: the United States, Canada, England, Germany, France, Egypt, tlriq, India, China, and Japan.' To their message the Guardian cabled in reply: tOverjoyed, deeply thankful.  Appreciate greeting. Loving remembrance Holy Shrine.' In addition to the cablegram, the delegates at every conference signed a letter which read as follows: 

~Dearly4eloved Guardian:   

  eToday young Baha'is are celebrating in international conferences the inauguration of another Baha'i year. 

 In unity with our fellows throughout the world we have 1 Conferences occurred in Binghamton, Boston, Montreal, Philadelphia, Teaneck, Washington, B. C., Cleveland, Flint, Lima, Milwaukee, Wilmette, Denver,  Los Angeles, Monroe, Phoenix, San Francisco; and in London, Paris, Hamburg, Heidelberg, Alexandria, Baghdad, Karachi, Poona, Canton, and Tokyo.


<p68>
68              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  joined in a new determination to serve the Cause of 

Baha'u'llah.              

 r~/j~ thought underlying all our efforts is that, led by your wishes and stimulated by your prayers and trust in us, we may rise to those heights of endeavor to which the example  of your own life so clearly directs us. May the seed of Baha'u'llah's Word find in our hearts soil which, prepared by service and study, enriched by tests, and continually  nourished by His blessings, may attain capacity to produce His fruits. That our lives may bear testimony to the reality of our Faith, becoming thus potent instruments  for the shaping of His great civilization, is our deepest hope. 

 To you, our beloved Guardian, and to the members of the Holy Family and friends of the household, we send our tender love and devotion, longing to become more worthy, that we may be in truth your coworkers  in the establishment of the World Order of 

Baha'u'llah.'            

  "It is impossible to estimate the true significance of these meetings. Not less than fifty American localities participated, as the conferences were regional in nature. Each conference seemed unique in a spirit of enthusiasm  and joy; each described the value of its experience in individual and diverse terms; each released without doubt a new energy throughout the region of its influence. 
In the opinion of the     

National Spiritual  Assembly

 of the Baha'is of the U. S. and Canada, there was testablished a new and important public activity which can develop into a great asset to our teaching work, as well as a powerful means for developing  experience and capacity among members of the youth groups. 

 "But surmounting and transforming these practical benefits was the dynamic unity which stood demonstrated around the Baha'i world. Nations might be at war; rivalries and antagonisms between countries might run high; the theories and credos of totalitarian States could violate the oneness of humanity; religious, class and racial dogmas could divide in subtle and treacherous ways those who in reality were interdependent; but Baha'i youth were not affected! The power of Baha'u'llah had rescued them horn such delusions, His love had stamped them with a true affection for their brothers, and under the shadow and protection of His World Order they joined their hands and hearts. For reasons quite other than these conferences, the year ninety-three will gain import as it recedes into history. Baha'i youth are proud to have signalized its opening with their first international celebration." 

  The following account of each meeting has been prepared for publication in Baha'i Youth. 
                          
   AMERICAN CONFERENCES      

  a. Central Area (1)     It is fitting that one of the largest and most successful meetings was held at Wibnette in the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, with representatives of the Chicago, North Shore, Urbana, and Madison youth groups. 

 The delegates first met at buffet supper, then took part in the Naw-Rtiz Feast in the Temple. On Sunday morning a teaching conference was held, and in the afternoon five young speakers addressed an audience which filled Foundation Hall. 

 Their talks were characterized in a telegram from an observer as tvery clear, well done and with wonderful spirit. Deeply moving to everyone. 

 (2) Cleveland, Ohio, called an impromptu  meeting, as the youth were unable to travel to Lima. Marzieh Carpenter spoke on her recent experiences in I ran. 

 "(3) Flint, Michigan, was conference center for Baha'i youth of Flint, Detroit, Marysville, Pt. Huron, and Idlewild, who, after Sunday breakfast together, met for a short devotional meeting and a thorough discussion of Baha'i responsibilities. 

 Emphasis  was laid on the reconciliation of international and national loyalties. 

 The group recommended the importance of Esperanto, subscription to La Nova Ta go, and inclusion of Esperanto articles in 

Baha'i Youth.             

 CC (4) Youth of Toledo, Columbus, Akron,  Cincinnati, Dayton, Fremont, and Lima met in Dma, Ohio, for a teaching conference, luncheon, and public meeting


<p69>
CURRENT BAHA'! ACTIVITIES             69

  at which two young and two adult Baha'is were speakers. The group reported a great success and the thope that other years will bring us together again at this happy season. 

 (5)     Mrs. Howard Ives was guest and discussion leader at the conference in Milwaukee,  Wisconsin, in which Kenosha also joined. 

 International contacts and local work with international groups were particularly emphasized. Delegates also defined the Baha'i moral code which young Baha'is must establish among themselves. 

  b. Western Area (6)     Denver, Colorado, found the chief value of its conference in the experience of organization gained by the group. This effort, it was felt, would set an auspicious example for future plans. 

     CC (7) Southern California

 youth of Los Angeles, Glendale, Pasadena, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Southgate, and San Bernardino  joined in planning a public symposium ambitiously publicized and executed. 

 Two thousand programs bearing a reproduction of the Temple were distributed. 

 Publicity appeared in seven Los Angeles papers and in three suburban communities. Posters announced  the meeting at six colleges, two central libraries, and in six other localities. Also, for perhaps the first time, the Baha'i Faith received publicity in motion pictures, as two theaters showed an announcement and picture of the Temple. 

 These preparations  were repaid by an audience of almost four hundred for the meeting in the Woman's Club of Hollywood, including a large representation from several Negro organizations. 

 Many new friends were made for the Cause. 

 (8)     The conference in Monroe, Washington,  represented youth from Seattle and Sultan as well. The discussions were especially  fruitful, and the delegates resolved to continue such inter-community meetings. All were aware that they had scarcely penetrated  the surface of this great Message, but by planning regular classes in Monroe and Seattle they intend to remedy this situation. 

 (9)     The Baha'i youth of Phoenix, Arizona,  sponsored the Naw-RiXz Feast, fol lowing it on Sunday with a public program which was exceptionally attractive. 

 (10)     Seven communities joined in the teaching conference and public meeting in San Francisco, California. These included Oakland, Berkeley, Burlingame, Geyserville, Kenwood, and Knightsen.

A BAHA'I PIONEER IN ETHIOPIA

  In December, 1934, a letter was received reporting the formation of a Spiritual 

Assembly  on November     

 25 of that year at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The establishment of a Baha'i community in that land was accomplished by Sabri Elias, a believer from Egypt. 

 Referring to this achievement, the Spiritual Assembly of Haifa stated: "We are happy to report to our friends throughout  the world encouraging news of the progress of Baha'u'llah's Faith in Ethiopia —  the oniy independent Kingdom in Africa. 

 • Its fate seems uncertain and thus it is the more interesting to the Baha'is and the more significant that at this time of agita-don  and unrest, the Baha'i Faith should have started to permeate that historical land." 

 While conditions have been completely changed in the country since 1934, the local Assembly having been obliged to suspend its communications, the fruit of such a devoted effort has been permanently secured,

  in part at least, by the translation of Baha'i literature into the native language. 

 One of these volumes, in fact, was presented to Emperor Selassie at Jerusalem in 1936 by Mrs. 

Lorol Schopflocher of Montreal.

 "Through the activities of the National Spiritual Assembly of Egypt the Baha'i Cause had marvelous achievements outside Egypt. 

 In January, 1934, our dear brother, Sabri Effendi Elias of Alexandria, was sent to Ethiopia to settle there and teach the Cause in accordance with the desire of our beloved Guardian. He arrived at Addis Ababa and proceeded with his work with such zeal and energy that he was confirmed in giving the message to a certain number of natives and other nationalities. 

 The opponents, members of Muslim and Coptic clergy, could not succeed in their attempts in withholding the progress of the Cause. After one year of hard labor our friend succeeded in establishing the first Spiritual Assembly  in the Capital of that remote African  country. 

 "The first service which that Assembly accomplished was the revision of the Ethiopian  translation of tBh'''I1'h and the New Era' formerly undertaken by Sabri Effendi, and its printing. Pamphlets were also published in the Arnhara language and distributed among the public. The malicious reports by which slanderers tried to defame the Cause, and the accusations made by them, that Baha'i meetings have a p0-litical  attitude, caused the Royal Private Secretary to summon Atto Haylo Gibriel, the vice-president of the Assembly, who explained  the Baha'i Cause and produced its books which were highly appreciated by the Secretary. CAbdullihi Abmad Adari, another staunch friend, traveled to Lecampti in Ethiopia where he settled himself and is occupied in giving the message to his countrymen. 

 Owing to the present conditions of the country Sabri Effendi was requested by the authorities to return home with other foreigners. 

 He assures us that the Cause is firmly established in that country, and that the Abyssinian believers are so firm and kindled that they will faithfully carry on the work during his absence. 

  GRADUAL ENFORCEMENT GE     
       BAHA'I LAWS                

  In the "Book of Aqdas," revealed by Baha'u'llah in the form of answers to questions,  the worldwide Baha'i community possesses a common foundation in the elements  of spiritual principles and also constitutional laws. 

 The Faith has progressed to the point where a number of these principles and laws can already be conscientiously observed. 

 Among these are, the use of the obligatory  daily prayers, the keeping of the period of fasting each year, the practice of monogamy,  the avoidance of alcoholic liquors, and the injunction laid upon believers to obtain the consent of their parents before a Baha'i marriage can be entered into. 

 Another social law enforced whenever possible among Baha'i communities is that which forbids secular work on the nine Holy Days of the Faith. These Days are listed in the Baha'i Calendar included in Part Two of the present  volume. 

 Baha'is, therefore, are united not only by a common devotion to the Manifestation, by a common acceptance of Teachings on spiritual and social subjects, and by loyalty to their institutions, but also by definite practices setting them apart from the nonBahA'i  community and possessing unique x~alues for the development of character. 

 'Writing on this important subject, the Guardian has said: The Laws revealed by Baha'u'llah in the Aqdas are, whenever practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil Laws of the land, absolutely binding  on every believer or Baha'i institution whether in the East or in the West. Certain laws, such as fasting, obligatory prayers, the consent of the parents before marriage, avoidance of alcoholic drinks, monogamy, should be regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at the present time. Already, in Egypt, Itr6n, India and tlrAq, Assemblies, both local and national,  are availing themselves of the opportunity  which the autonomy granted to Eastern religious comrnunjties in matters of personal status has offered them, to press for the recognition by the civil authorities of such Laws of the Aqdas which they con


<p72>

 scientiously feel they must uphold and enforce. 

 They have even, under certain circumstances, preferred to suspend their activities and dissolve their institutions rather than follow the dictates of those officials who have tried to induce them to violate what has been expressly ordained by the Author of their 

Faith."                   
                          
LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE NAME
CCBAHA~I~~ AND SYMBOL     
   OF THE GREATEST NAME      

  Under the protection afforded by the laws controlling trade marks, the name CCBah6ui~~ has been legally registered in both the United States and Canada by the National Spiritual Assembly, and similar protection has also been obtained for the symbol of the Greatest Name. 

       The National Spiritual    
Assembly of Australia    

 and New Zealand have taken similar steps for the registration of the 

Greatest Name.            
         The American and Canadian 

 registrations are reproduced elsewhere in the present work. 

 It is evident that the unique spiritual power established by Baha'u'llah will before long exercise such influence as to attract those irresponsible souis who seek to attach themselves to any source of prestige, and likewise arouse the attention of others who might seek to mislead the public. 

 A revealed  Faith is universal, and in each cycie is offered freely to the entire world. The Baha'i Faith, however, involves an administrative  order and a degree of discipline raising it above the realm of the spiritud philosophies which can be adapted to suit the individual understanding. The believers, therefore, realize a responsibility in upholding the full and complete standard of faith, which remains incomplete until membership  in the Baha'i order is attained. 
                          
     NEW TRANSLATIONS          

  During the past two years, the list of translations has been greatly extended. 

 The Word has been made available to added millions of souL in many parts of the world. The new translations include the following titles: C(Bhf~~11~h and the New Era" has been translated and published in Amharic,

  Most of these versions are likely to prove oniy temporary versions, yet they are a vital necessity to the promotion of a World Faith. The permanent editions of the future must await the formation of that group of international scholars described by !Abd~1BhA 

   LOCAL INCORPORATIONS       

  The Guardian's comment upon the legal incorporation of local Spiritual Assemblies was transmitted to the New York Assembly in 1932, through his secretary, after receiving  the first draft of the proposed 

Articles of Incorporation  

 and ByLaws prepared by that Assembly. 'tlt is surely very important to give to the local &piritual Assembly some legal standing, for as the Cause progresses and its adherents increase, they will be confronted with duties they cannot even imagine  at present. 

 Not oniy will they have to make contracts for acquiring halls for their meeting places, but they will also be obliged to create new institutions to care for their sick, poor and aged people. We hope that before long the Baha'is will be able to afford schools that would provide children the intellectual and spiritual education as prescribed in the Writings of Baha'u'llah and the 

Master."                   

 Since the last international survey was prepared, the following Spiritual Assemblies have incorporated: Washington, D. C.; Montreal, Quebec; Bombay, Karachi and Calcutta, 

India; Rangoon, Mandalay   
and Daidanaw-Kalazoo,      

Burma; and Auckland, New   
Zealand. The Spiritual     

 Assembly of London, England, has registered the Baha'i Faith with the authorities as a definite religious community, and the Baha'i Center has now the status of a place of worship. 
                           
  TURKISTAN AND CAUCASUS     

  The city of tlshqThid has long been notable from the Baha'i point of view in that the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar was constructed  in that city. 

 Before the Baha'i activities came under control of the political authorities under the new Russian r~gime, they had been developed to a high degree of efficiency. Educational facilities had been established, a monthly publication was issued, and the Baha'i Temple and sur rounding grounds had become influential in the life of the city. 

 It is gratifying to report that the condition  of the local Baha'i communities improved  considerably between 1934 and 1936. 

 In 1928, the Law expropriating religious  edifices, from which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar had for some time been immune, was applied to that Baha'i edifice. 

 The use of the structure, however, was continued under a five year lease. This lease was renewed  in 1933, for a similar period. 

 In 1935, a new administrative ruling restored all religious buildings to their original owners  for an indefinite period, and under this ruling the Baha'is were held responsible for extensive repairs to be effected within six months. Through united sacrifice these terms were met, with the result that the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and its surrounding gardens are fully restored to Baha'i ownership, and their impressive beauty again blesses the city. 

 Beside the entrance gates of the Temple, the Baha'i principles have been inscribed on suspended signs in four languages. 

 Public meetings, held twice a week, have been resumed  in the sacred 

House of Worship.          

 It is reported also that the annual Baha'i election, the teaching activities, inter-com-munity  correspondence and other plans of the Spiritual Assembly are proceeding with only slight and occasional civil interference. The great significance of this improved status of the Faith in these centers is that it prepares the way for the formation of a National Spiritual Assembly, a necessary step in the establishment of the first International 

House of Justice.

 Concerning developments in India and Burma, reports from the National Spiritual Assembly convey the following information: ttThere has been marked progress of the Baha'i Cause in India and Burma during the last two years. 

 Besides internal consolidation of the Local Spiritual Assemblies and the National Spiritual Assembly, there has been great progress in popularizing the Cause by means of a teaching campaign and in translation of Baha'i literature into sey

  erai Indian tongues. tBh"'11'h and the New Era' has been translated into Gujerati, Burmese and IJrdu. Sindhi, Bengali and 1-lindi translations are in course of prepara-don and will be published in 1936. The Urdu translation of tSome Answered Questions' is almost ready and its publication has just been taken in hand by the 

National Assembly. The     
Publication Committee      

 is contemplating translating many other books into Indian vernacular tongues. 

   C eThe Baha'i Magazine   

 (Urdu and Persian),  formerly published under the name of Kaukib-i-Hind, is a widely circulated magazine and has gained considerably in popularity  and has helped in spreading the Cause far and wide. The 

American Baha'i Magazine  

 now known as cWld Order' has a circulation  of about forty copies among the English-reading Indians. 

 Many copies of tThe Dawn-Breakers' (Nabil's Narrative) and CBa114~U~11Th and the New Era,' English as well as Urdu and Gujerati editions, were presented to the libraries of the Universities as well as to public libraries and to leading men, and thus a large number of people have been reached through 

Baha'i literature. Articles

 were contributed to the magazines and journals and through them the attention  of the public was drawn to the Cause. The seventh All-Indian Baha'i Convention held in Bombay in April this year (1935) attracted to the public lectures varied audiences  comprising Hindus, Moslems, Christians, Zoroastrians and others. 
A lecture tour of the      

Universities of Northern   

 India, Delhi, Agra, Aligarh, Benares, Allahabad and Lucknow was organized and lectures were delivered under the auspices of 

University  Unions, Oriental
Societies, Religious Fellowship

 Groups as well as under the auspices  of the Theosophical 

Society, the Brahmo Samaj  

 and the Arya Samaj. A tour of the province of Sindh was undertaken and some important towns in the province were visited. 

 A Sindbi translation of Haft Wadi (Seven Valleys) was distributed and this was very much liked because the province  of Sindh had for several centuries been dominated by Sufi thought. Contacts were formed with such religious organizations as the Ahmedias or followers of Mirza. Gliulam Alimed of Qadian (who claimed to be the Promised Messiah), the Theosophical Society, the Arya Samaj and the 

Brahmo Samaj.              

 "Both the vastness of the country and the variety of its beliefs and differences of language make the task of the National Assembly extremely difficult, and it is on account of these causes and not so much because of the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Baha'is of India that the progress of the Cause has been dow. The National  Assembly, however, realizes this and steps are accordingly being taken to so conduct the teaching campaign as to make it reach all the provinces, in all the provincial languages and to all classes of people and specially to the intelligentsia of the country.  A fair amount of success has been already achieved and it is hoped better re-suits  will be obtained in the years to come. 

 !(The process of seed sowing is, however, going on apace and there are great possibilities  in store for the Baha Faith in this vast country which is a continent. We should face the situation with redoubled energy and trust in the intrinsic worth of the teachings of His 

Holiness Baha'u'llah.       

 teIn order to effect coordination between the friends of India and Burma, the N. S. A. deputed Mr. HishmatuliTh to visit Burma and stimulate the friends of that country. As a result of this visit which produced a general awakening among our Burmese brothers, it was decided to form a National Council of the Baha'is of All-Burma under the direction of the N. S. A. This Council held its first meeting on the 9th, 10th and 11th of April, 1935, at Daidanaw, the Burmese  Baha'i village, and passed several very important resolutions. One of them was the addition of an English and Urdu section to the already existing Burmese school at the village. 
                           
    From the National Spiritual

 Assembly of Egypt we have the following: "In Egypt, as it is in other countries of the world, the Baha'i Cause is maintaining its steady progress. Although exposed to fanatical attempts of people of different faiths, the teachings of Baha'u'llah, nevertheless,  receive the highest appreciation and deepest respect on the part of educated and cultured classes.

76              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  "As a most advanced country in the Muhammadan  world, and the largest center of Muslim studies, Egypt necessarily exercises such an opposition as may suppress, as they suppose, the increasing influence of a Cause which she unjustly deems anti-Muliarnma-dan. 

 In fact, the historic pronouncement of 1925, made by the Muslim Court of Egypt by which the Baha'i religion was declared entirely independent of IslAm, and Baha'is, heretics; the subsequent divorce of their Muslim wives, and tbe various attempts  by which the Muslim ecclesiastical authorities try, now and then, to uproot the Cause — all of these facts embody the extent  of opposition attempted against a growing Faith. Nevertheless, such attempts have assisted the Baha'i Cause in Egypt to attain a most favorable condition, and have clarified its status. 

 "Although deprived under the circumstances  from legal protection concerning matters of personal status, IBahA'is, however, thanks to the confirmations of Baha'u'llah, were given the opportunity, truly unique, to sever themselves totally from the old fetters of Islim, and to apply freely, through their Administrative Bodies, their personal status according to the 

Divine Laws and Ordinances
of Baha'u'llah.           

 ~~Further events had also enhanced the influence of the Cause. Apart from the individual sufferings caused by the unceasing attacks, persecutions were managed against Baha'i groups in almost every Baha'i center. Prior to 

1934, Baha'is of Alexandria 

 were persecuted by mobs aroused by a certain Muslim clergyman. 

 "In 1934, a storm of religious antagonism raged throughout the country in consequence of the redoubled energy of the Christian missionaries. 

 Observing that the number of converted boys and girls of Muslim origin who were attending missionary institutions was increasing, Muslims started a movement in which their leaders, mull&s and even the grand shaykh of Ishm associated themselves. 

 Investigations were made by the legal authorities, whereupon most of those boys and girls were taken out of those institutions and contributions were made to provide other institutions for them. The movement would have produced the worst consequences had nor the Govern-rnent  dealt with it wisely. 

 ~tBUt the attempt was directed to the destruction of the Baha'i Cause more than it was made against 

Christian missionaries. Leading

 articles were published daily under headings, such as: 'BaM'ism is the real injury  to Islim,' tMissionaries attract immature  individuals but Baha'is attract people of intellect.' 

 ~tAs that movement emanated from Port Said, the Baha'is there were subject to more pressure. The Maazoun (Muslim registrar of marriage contracts) started a series of lectures against the Cause. His attempt to arouse mobs against Baha'is was at first suppressed by the authorities; but due to the effective interference of high religious authorities who were repeatedly approached by the leaders of the movement in Port Said, the lecturer was given permission to continue. Failing in their attempt to create anti-BaM'i disturbances, the instigators persuaded  a Muslim wife to bring a charge against her Baha'i husband before the Muslim  court to divorce her. Four religious lawyers volunteered to defend her. The pronouncement was adjourned twice owing to the absence of the defendant despite the fact that the lawyers, producing Baha'i books as witness, urged that sentence be passed. 

 The judge, having examined those books and considered the statement of the plaintiff that she neither complained against the behavior of the husband nor his treatment of her, refused to give the pronouncement  before he could hear the statement of the defendant. While the case was running its course, both wife and husband were living  together in harmony. His brother of Cairo, whom he had attracted to the Cause, visited them and succeeded in settling the matter and reconciling them. As both parties  did not attend the court any longer their case was actually cancelled. The events of 1934 in Port Said repeated those of 1914, 1920, and 1926, and formed a link in the chain of unceasing persecutions during  which the Cause of Baha'u'llah became firmly established in Port Said. 
 "In Cairo, the largest    

Baha'i center, Baha'is    

 were called upon by two detectives who made their necessary enquiries as to


<p77>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES              77

  whether Baha'i meetings function in the same manner as those of missionaries. 

 Next day the local chairman and secretary paid a visit to them and presented some pamphlets and Baha literature which were highly appreciated.  After a short yet interesting in —  terview, assurance was given to the Baha'is that they could freely hold their meetings as usual, and should report at once in case there was any anti-Bahi'i disturbance. 

 C(The most important matters which absorb  the care of our Administrative Bodies at present are those pertaining to personal status. 

 Thus, marriage contracts, passport certificates, as well as letters of guarantee, are all issued by those bodies. In order to conduct the affairs according to the Divine Laws of Baha'u'llah, the general rules from the tKitAb-i-Aqdas' were adopted by the National Assembly, which work, having been sanctioned by the Guardian, was published and distributed among the local Assemblies to apply them to matters of personal  status. Such marriage contracts and different certificates issued by 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 are regarded as possessing considerable  importance by the authorities to whom they are delivered. 

 For instance, the marriage contract of our friend 

Aly Effendi Ruhi of Transjordania

 was, after a long and deliberate consultation, recognized by the British Consulate and a passport for the Egyptian bride was issued accordingly. 

 The marriage contract of Fouad Effendi Yazdi, and later the divorce document, were accepted  and actually registered by the IrAnian Legation. Passports were also issued to Sabri Effendi Elias and to his wife on their trip to Ethiopia, according to certificates supplied by the Spiritual Assemblies. 

 The first step taken in this respect was in Port Said when Philip Effendi Naimi applied for a passport for his wife. Being of Christian origin he was requested by the passport office to have an official certificate from the Patriarchate to which he belonged. 

 Stating that he is a Baha'i and that the Baha'i Spiritual Assembly is the oniy body which can supply him with the required certificate, after some days of consultation the passport was issued according to the Baha'i certificate. 

 ttBurial services were also performed by the Spiritual Assembly of Port Said according to Baha'i rites after the passing of the late 

H~ji Mubammad Yazdi.       

 A ring bearing  the Greatest Name was worn on his finger and a congregational prayer was read, after which the funeral was conducted in absolute silence and the most reverent attitude. 

 ccDuring the last two years the National Assembly endeavored to obtain official recognition. 

 They approached the Government with the view to invoke their sympathy so as to settle the Baha'i case and to clarify the situation of the Baha'is in conformity with the pronouncement of 1925. Personal interviews with certain officials in the Ministry  of Justice showed that the Government is not prepared to extend further recognition  to fresh religious communities. 

 As the matter is thus remaining outstanding, the National Assembly, directed by the Guardian, endeavored to maintain the registration of the 

Declaration of Trust       

 by the Mixed Court, and this action was successfully performed.  In order to render that registration effective an acre of cultivated land was offered to the National Assembly by our dear friend Sharoubeem Effendi Ebeid on the occasion of the annual convention of 1935. Legal actions are being taken by the National AssembLy to have the property transferred to the Assembly. 

 ccThe Arabic translation of ~Kit&b-i-IqTh' the Book of Certitude, and its publication, enriched the Baha'i Library. Copies were sent to the various countries in the Orient where the need for the Arabic translation is growing. 

 During the last two years the Baha'i Library supplied tlr4q, Palestine, Turkey, Tunis, as well as Geneva with Baha'i books in both the Arabic and Idnian languages. 

 CCTh annual convention of 1935 recorded  the ultimate desire of the delegates to build a Haziratu'1-Quds. 

 Thanks to the Abhi confirmations and to the encouraging donation of the Guardian, contributions are being collected from the believers of Egypt. As the first six months sanctioned for those contributors desiring to pay in installments will end on March, 1936, the National Assembly will, at that time, decide whether the work can be started or whether more

  funds will be required. 

 At all events, it is hoped that the year of 1936 will mark a striking stage in the evolution of the Baha'i Cause and its wide progress in Egypt." 
                           
     From the National Spiritual

 Assembly of the Baha'is of tIr6.q have come the following  statements. 

 ctThe general conditions and status of the Baha'is in tldq is fairly good, because Religious  Liberty, for which the constitution of the country makes provision, enables the Baha'is to hold their spiritual meetings regularly and in complete freedom. 

 It enables  believers to propound the divine message  among their co-citizens with persistent zeal and devotion. This condition is, however,  not without disturbance and sLanderous attacks from religious bigots, and narrow-minded people who ignore the heavenly grandeur underlying this great Cause. 

 "The Assembly bought a plot of land for the erection of a I-Iaziratu'1-Quds in an ideal place adjoining 

Baglidid. The Hazi-ratu'1-Quds 

 is to be constructed on modern lines, and in conformity with the high station occupied by Baglidid in the Baha'i World. The plan has been completed and meets with this requirement. 

 A copy has been also submitted to our beloved Guardian for approval. But construction was not proceeded with, pending the completion of the necessary municipal formalities, and when this has been completed, the Assembly  hopes to proceed with the construction work immediately. 

 ~~The Assembly translated Dr. Essle-mont's  tBah~'u'11ih and the New Era' into the Kurdish Language, and it was printed in Baglidid with several beautiful illustrations. 

 tcThe Assembly entertained the hope of spreading the Cause of Baha'u'llah among the Kurds, in view of their responsiveness and readiness for such message. 

 The more so as their language is poor in literature of any kind, and especially in Baha'i books. 

 "The publication of such a book in the Kurdish language will most assuredly meet with a gratifying success, and in this way Kurds would be attracted by the uplifting Baha'i principles, and their divine program. But it is to be deplored that the authorities have confiscated the book before its publication in final form. 

 "During the summer of 1935, a copy of the National Assembly's news letter fell into the hands of an editor of a religious paper in Baghdad. The news letter embodies  the minutes of the Fifth Baha'i Convention in tIr~q, with a detailed program of the Assembly for the year. The paper published the greater part of the account, and commented upon it in consecutive weekly issues, according to the dictates of its biased and prejudiced attitude, alleging that the Baha'i Faith is a great menace to the nation, and described Baha'is as dangerous, and unpatriotic, while urging the government to be rid of its Baha'i officials. This anti-Bah6N drive had precisely the opposite effect on the Baha'is who became more consolidated and united, and met this attack with unperturbed emotions, and inflexible courage. 

 It was a golden opportunity for teaching the Cause, as nonbelievers  became interested, and began to inquire about this new Faith with such a body of doctrine. The more alert of these peoples began to approach Baha'is and inquire about the reality of their religion, and thereby formed a more representative and accurate view of the Faith. 

 "At Mosul the Baha'is      

 used to hold their meetings in a house rented for that purpose. But a few fanatics began to incite the owner to oust the Baha'is from his house, and used coercion and even threats to force his hand. 

 In the face of this critical situation  the owner of the house asked the Bab's to vacate the place, and save him inconvenience and ill reputation. The Baha'is complied with his request, and remained  for a time without a meeting center, until they succeeded in finding a proper place which they made into a Haziratu'1-Quds. 

 "But fanatics did not stop there. Some of their religious heads began to speak in Mosques, and launch slanderous attacks and indictments against the Baha'is. Afterwards they were followed by a Jewish Rabbi who spoke in the Synagogue, and delivered a virulent speech on the believers,


<p79>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             79

  singling out one Baha'i for special condemnation, and the Baha'i in question received permission from the Assembly to start legal proceedings against the Rabbi in the civil Courts. 

 When it transpired that the Baha'i intended to take action, the Rabbi sent some Jewish notables to intervene on his behalf, and asked the Baha'is to forgive him. He apologized and offered his deep regrets, promising not to attack the cause in future. Consequently, the Baha'i dropped his case. 

 "This drastic step was not taken for the sake of revenge but to cut short similar attacks in future and at the same time to be a factor for the spread of the Cause in that city. 

 tcThe Baha'is of Avashiq hold their meetings regularly, enjoying the esteem of their fellow men. The government opened a primary school for their children, who constitute the majority of the school cLi-dren.  It happened that at the end of summer, 1934, at the opening of the school session, that the teacher appointed for the school was a backward and intolerant man. He began to sow the seed of discrimination and enmity among the pupils, by speaking in lesson hours very slightingly and scornfully  of the Baha'i pupils, deprecating the Faith of their parents. 

 The Muslim pupils began to maltreat their fellow Baha'i children,  and the matter reached such a point that the conflict and friction influenced the parents of the children, with the result that the Baha'i boys were compelled to discontinue  their lessons. On the directions of the National Spiritual 

Assembly, the Baha'is     

 of Avashiq submitted a petition to the Minister of Education. The teacher was reprimanded severely, a fine was imposed  upon him, and he was transferred to a remote place as a punishment for his harsh treatment and misbehavior. 

 The government then appointed two teachers who fulfilled their function with a sense of duty and impartiality." 
                          
    The Baha'is of Shanghai   

 during the past two years have established a library in a room taken at the Chinese Y. M. C. A., and have begun planning for the translation of more Baha'i literature in 

Chinese.                  

 In Japan, during the same period, Miss Agnes Alexander has succeeded in placing a great deal of Baha'i publicity in The Japan Times, a Japanese owned daily of Tokyo published in English. Thanks to this medium, the Teachings of Baha'u'llah have come to the attention of a new and wider circle. 

 Miss Alexander likewise found it possible to arrange for the publication of an article on the House of Worship at Wilmette in a Buddhist daily paper, the translation having been made by the editors. 

     From Miss Alexander's     

 report the following excerpts convey interesting details. 

 "As Mr. Toni is an Esperantist, the way opened for me to speak on the Cause to the Esperanto group of Kyoto, and also to a group of blind Esperantists, teachers from schools for the blind in different parts of Japan, who had gathered in Kyoto for a Summer School session. 

 A Braille weekly newspaper of Osaka also published an article about the Baha'i Temple, which was headed, tMiss Alexander a Great Friend of the Blind in Japan.' A friend of Mr. Toni's, who could read printing only letter by letter with the aid of a round crystal, and who had in this way copied an English dictionary into Braille, the work of many years, eagerly received the Baha'i teachings. It was with delight he read the English Braille edition of Esslernont's tBahi'u'lIAh and the New Era,' of which there is one copy in Japan. 

 Also, through the cooperation of Mr. and Mrs. Tot-u, I was enabled to place an article explaining the Baha'i teachings with the Osaka daily paper, which is the second largest daily in Japan. In the September 28, 1935, edition of the paper this appeared under the title, which tans-lated  reads, CBah4~i Religion Born from the World's Restlessness.' Both the pictures of the BaLI Temple and of CAbdu~1~Bah& appeared with this article."

80              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The spiritual character and controlling principle of the Baha'i year now brought to a close were established for us by Shoghi Effendi in these words dated September 16, 1934: "The situation in IrAn which is growing from bad to worse, the necessary measures which should be taken to insure the unin —  terrupted completion of the clerestory section of the Temple, the adoption of such measures as will stimulate the teaching campaign in America, the exercise of the utmost vigilance lest the authorities of Soviet Russia inflict any injury upon Baha lives and institutions, the extension of any support that may be required to safeguard the interests of the Cause at its most vital and international center to ward off the malicious attacks of enemies from both within and without — these are the outstanding  issues which demand the sustained and concentrated attention of every believer." 

 This statement of outstanding issues, more definitely and more vigorously than in any previous communication from the Guardian, has served to summon each and every loyal Baha'i to arise above undue concern with local and even national matters and assume his duties and responsibilities as citizen in that World Order of Baha'u'llah to establish which the Divine 'Will has revealed itself to mankind. Now in the realm of action the Baha'is have the supreme privilege of receiving guidance and inspiration from one central point, even as since the Announcement of the Mb the believers have had one central point in the realm of the soui. 

 In its fulness of meaning, in its call for positive action, the statement cannot be limited to any single period of time. Rather may we perceive in it the beginning of an era of greater maturity, larger responsibility, as the followers of Baha'u'llah unite in resistance to the forces of the world. 

 In preparation for this responsibility, the Guardian has conducted us through two preliminary phases of development since the Ascension of Abdu'l-Baha. 

 The first phase was that of learning the principles of the administrative order. The second phase was that of learning the principles of the World Order of Baha'u'llah, a phase marked by the successive ttWorld Order" letters which began in February, 1929. The third phase, now beginning, is the application of this knowledge to important problems — prob-lerns  which relate the Cause to society as a whole, and not merely those minor problems of our own Baha'i relationships which have engaged our attention and almost exhausted  our powers in previous years. 

 The thoughtful believer will not fail to pursue this analysis until he can perceive the underlying factors in the progress of the Faith as a whole. 

 What has happened during this Baha'i year, in brief, is that an entirely new emphasis has been given all Baha'i thought and action, identically the same emphasis which life lays upon the individual  on that day when childhood ahd youth, with their preoccupations with self, first begin to realize the tasks which usher in the time of maturity. What we have learned since 1921, and what we have established  as our attitude toward the Cause and toward life, are now undergoing supreme test until it has been proved that individually  and collectively we are worthy to uphold the true and highest interests of a Divine 

Faith.                     

 Nor will it be overlooked, as we adopt this larger perspective, that the Guardian issued his first communication on the 

World Order of Baha'u'llah  

 about six months before the world's economic order underwent so fatal a collapse in the autumn of 1929. The germ of the new order became apparent to Baha'is before the world received its first warning that the old order could not longer endure. These Providential matters are surely our first and deepest concern, since only as we grasp them can we adjust ourselves  to that irresistible motion of progress which is the sign of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah. 

 One word more on this most thrilling and vital of Baha'i topics. In the communication  received just before the Annual Convention of 1934, published as ~tThe Dispensation  of 

Baha'u'llah," Shoghi       

 Effendi brought together in one perfect unity all those aspects of the Revelation which we, in our human limitations, had been considering


<p81>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             81

  as separate realities: the Station of Manifestations, the mysterious Mission of the Center of the Covenant, the full significance of His Will and Testament, and the nature of that Order which the Testament bequeaths to the friends. In a communication  so comprehensive, so organic, so unified in its wholeness and so perfected in its parts, we may now realize that Shoghi Effendi marked definitely for us an ending of our education in details of Baha'i service, and a beginning of our responsibility in demonstrating  our faith and our unity to our fellow men. 

 Indeed, the successive steps which Shoghi Effendi has taken to train, to instruct and to discipline the Baha'i community are all paralleled by a swift continuance of that process of disintegration in human society which has become the more apparent as efforts to attain peace and stability have successively failed. Fourteen years ago the Baha'i community was still as a child in the household of civilization, apparently bearing no responsibility for the fate of that household, and therefore concerned only with the joys and sorrows of the child's own growth, the dreams of its own future. 

 Today, with the household in dire confusion and distress, the youth born of the new age is called upon to prove his birthright and demonstrate his capacity to achieve eternal peace, his elders having failed. 

 By comparison with that standard of action, every local or personal issue assumes only a relative importance. Such issues can no longer entirely surround and engulf us at the expense of the world vision which the Guardian has given us this year. 

 Larger than the individual is the local community; larger than the local community is the national communty; larger still than any national community is the World Order which now claims not merely our passive acceptance and belief but a devotion and consecration which a collapsing society will test with fire. 
                          
       Major Events              

  Without the perspective of time it is impossible to determine precisely which events of a Baha'i year have major importance. 

 One may, nevertheless, without finality, refer to certain events as representing occurrences or trends meriting special attention. 

 1. As has been reported to the friends, the Guardian has clarified the problem of how to present the 'Will and Testament to new believers. In accordance with his instructions, a new edition of the Testament has been prepared and published which, until further instructions are given, includes  the text to be explained to and accepted by those who apply for enrollment as Baha'is. The supplementary excerpts which precede and follow the selections from the Testament are in themselves the most perfect of explanations. The edition consisting of the complete text is now almost exhausted, but the National Spiritual Assembly has recorded its responsibility in continuing to supply at least one complete text to each newly elected 

Spiritual Assembly.      

 2. The contract for the completion of the clerestory section of the Temple dome unit, one of the outstanding issues mentioned by Shoghi Effendi, has throughout this year proceeded as rapidly as weather permitted. 

 Despite the economic difficulty which has prevailed, the believers have made notable sacrifices in order to meet the collective  obligation, the fulfilment of which will mean that the Dome unit is at last entirely finished. 

 In the case of future Temple construction, the Guardian has advised that contracts  be entered into by the Trustees only when the necessary amount of cash is actually on hand. The Dome unit, however, was undertaken and has been carried on in a spirit of trust that the Guardian's wiThes and instructions would be voluntarily met. 

 In September and in December, the difference between income and obligation compelled the National Spiritual Assembly to issue an appeal directed to every American believer lest the work in its final stages be temporarily abandoned. 

 All along it has been felt that the problem was not economic but spiritual; not a matter of dollars and cents but one of resolution and of unified response. For, in its ultimate significance, the building of the Temple


<p82>
82              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  is not an end in itself. 

 It is a vital step in the training of the Baha'i community in the divine art of unity. As such a tremendous  task is achieved, the power comes to carry out other collective missions in service  to the beloved Cause. National achievement is nothing else than a stepping stone to international services. 

 The important details of this subject will be presented in the Treasurer's report. 

 At this time it is important to emphasize the fact that this obligation is not yet fully discharged. 

 3.     The passing of the venerable, the beloved  and revered Dr. Susan I. Moody in the field of her life work at Tihr~n furnishes  the Baha'i world one more example of heroism and consecration a later generation  of believers may well take to heart. How fruitful her life was! What noble institutions she developed, what a monument  she reared in the lives of youth of I ran! Even the enemies of the Cause could not withhold their admiration and their recognition of her sincerity! Even officialdom refrained from destructive measures until her stalwart Baha'i presence had been removed from the scene! How brief will be that restless triumph, seizing its opportunity so blindly from the folded hands of death, ignorant of that Kingdom to which the faithful believer goes, that Kingdom whence comes the Will that governs the world! 

 4.     In no year of which we have record have there been so many enrollments of new believers as during the year now closed. Both in number of the new members added to existing communities, and in number of groups prepared for election of a Spiritual Assembly for the first time, this present period has been one of remarkable growth. From Milwaukee came the news that more than sixty believers had been enrolled in one meeting; from Chicago, from New York and from many other communities reports of new enrollments surpass the announcements  made in previous years. Our teaching of the Cause, reinforced by the mysteriouS power of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, made more effective by our knowledge of the nature of the Baha'i community, has received a vast stimulus, inaugurating a movement forward surely destined to acquire greater emphasis in every successive year. 

 The details of this great achievement will be reported by the Teaching Committee, so that representatives from all local communities may return home inspired to work for renewed effort, and instructed to convey useful plans which have brought success in other cities. 

 Gratitude, however, must be expressed to all those teachers who during the year have answered the call to service and traveled to so many cities upholding the banner of the Faith. 

 This circulation of thought and devotion from city to city, in the person of the teachers who are able to travel, is a great stimulus to the Baha'i communities themselves as well as to the nonbelievers thereby attracted. But above all the firm unity of the local communities affords and wiii always afford the oniy enduring foundation  for the new era of vitality and spiritual zeal. The greatest teacher in the Cause of Baha'u'llah is not a person but a community not oniy united together on the plane of personality but imbued with conviction that its essential purpose is to open the doors to the new souis. 

  Communications from the 

Guardian                   

  The first communication from the Guardian was the cablegram sent in reply to the message cabled him by the Twenty-Sixth  Annual Convention. That cablegram, received after the Convention had closed, was reported in a general letter dated June 4, 1934 and also in the Convention Number of Baha'i News: "American believers' inspired leadership steadily unfolding to Baha'is world over potentialities majestic edifice heralding formative period Faith of Baha'u'llah. Their unerring vision conceived  its matchless design. tAbd'lBh" own hands laid its cornerstone. 

 Their dynamic faith reared its structure. Their sustained self-sacrifice crowned it with immortal  glory. 

 May flame their unconquerable enthusiasm continue glowing in their hearts till its naked frame is enveloped in its shining mantle." 

 Is not this message directed also to this Convention, since the task is yet unfinished? 

 In Baha'i News of July, 1934, were


<p83>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             83

  published excerpts from letters dated May 10, May 19, June 11, 1934, and cablegram received on May 18. The following subjects were treated: 1.     As soon as the clerestory section of the Temple is completed, no new contract to be made for the next unit until the entire sum required for the contract has already been collected. 

 2.     The scope of local news letters. 

 3.     News of the successful negotiations with the Palestine authorities concerning the exemption from taxation of the area surrounding the Shrines, tantamount to a recognition of the sacredness of the Shrines and the significance of the international center of the Faith. 

 4.     Appreciation of the American Baha'is' cooperation in preventing that area from falling into the hands of non-Bah6'is. 

 5.     The relation of local Assemblies to the National 

Spiritual Assembly.        

 6.     Affirmation of the supreme and undivided  authority of the N. S. A. and its moral responsibility if it allows any body or institution within its jurisdiction to abuse its privileges or to decline in the exer-cisc of its rights and privileges. 

 7.     Approval of instruction to disregard anonymous communications. 

 September Baha'i News carried the Guardian's explanation of passages in "The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah." 

 Excerpts from letters dated September 9, 16, 25 and 30, were published in November on the following subjects: 1.     The hope that through self-sacrifice further steps will be taken to safeguard the entire area surrounding the Shrines. 

 2.     Explanation of the general principle that no administrative body under the jurisdiction of the N. S. A. has authority to receive complaints against the Assembly, but that matters which are unsatisfactory are to be referred to the 

Guardian.                  

 3.     The list of "outstanding issues" already  mentioned in this Report. 

 4.     Renewed instruction that photographs of the Guardian are not to be circulated. 

 5.     Approval of statement concerning the Convention with correction of view that its sessions are joint meetings with the N.S.A. 6.     Request for English translations of Baha'i News Letters issued by the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and 

Austria.                   

 7.     Emphasis upon the necessity of maintaining  the flow of contributions to the Temple, and the importance of the National Fund as the indispensable medium for the growth and expansion of the Cause. Contributions to this fund constitute a way by which each believer can test the measure and character of his faith. 

 8.     The Guardian's inability to continue for the present his own contribution to the Temple Fund, in view of the severe restrictions imposed upon the Cause in Iran and the increase in the international expenses. In connection with this subject it is necessary  to point out that the Guardian has for years been contributing as much to the Cause in America as all the American believers, through the National Fund at least, are together contributing to the development of the Baha'i World Center. Difficult though it still is, apparently, to maintain the national budget, including Temple construction, must we not become, as the American Baha'i community, more deeply conscious of our collective responsibility  to the 

Guardian's International   

 Fund? Must we not begin to realize that a monthly contribution worthy of our combined resources  should constitute the first and not the last obligation upon our national 

Baha'i budget? Without     

 the Guardian's capacity to function materially as well as spiritually, are we not fatally Limiting the development of the Cause at its very Center? 

 Just as no local community can flourish if the National Fund be deprived of power to serve, so no national community in this unified Cause can flourish if the International  Fund at the disposal of the Guardian  is deprived of power. The matter is mentioned here oniy for deep and prayerful consideration, that a new resolve may be born and develop impetus until this omission  shall for the future be overcome. 

 Expression of the Guardian's gratitude that continuance of Temple construction was assured. 

 The January, 1935, number of Baha'i News contained excerpts from the Guardian's letters on the following subjects:


<p84>
84              THE BAHA WORLD

  1.     Explanation of further questions raised concerning the meaning of passages in "The Dispensation of 

Baha'u'llah."               

 2.     The use of Baha'i ringstones and burial stones left to the discretion of the believers pending the publication of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. 

     3.     The National Assemblies

 of Egypt, tlrAq and Iran are adopting the text of the American Declaration of Trust and ByLaws, at the Guardian's request, the N. S. A. of India and Burma having already taken this step. 

 4.     Approval of plan to unite the two magazines. 

 5.     Explanation of a passage on page 88 of ttBahi'i Administration" referring to the date when Oriental Baha'is celebrated the Declaration of the Bib in 1925. 

 6.     Explanation that when a Memorial is constructed in the pine grove at West Englewood to commemorate tAbdu'1-Bah4's visit to 

America, the Memorial      

 should take the form of a monument and not of a building. This explanation reminds us of the Guardian's previous instruction, that on account of the importance of the Unity Feast which the Master held on that spot, the sole Memorial commemorating His American visit is to be constructed there. The Guardian's views in this matter would seem to answer a question raised locally from time to time in various cities, namely, whether the local Spiritual Assembly should not take steps to acquire permanently some house which had been blessed by the Master's 

Holy Presence.             

 At this point in the Report might be inserted reference to the fact that during March, 1935, Roy C. Wilhelm executed an Indenture of Trust under which the Evergreen  Cabin property, and the two lots in the pine grove where the Unity Feast was celebrated in 1912, were transferred to the Cause through nine trustees in a manner similar to that under which the 

Temple and Green Acre      

 properties are now administered. The place so signally blessed by the Master  thus comes perpetually under Baha'i ownership and control by this generous gift. 

 7.     Approval of letter published in November  Baha'i News by the N. S. A. on the general subject of the relation of believers to their local, national and international  Baha'i institutions. 

 8.     The Guardian's abiding appreciation and gratitude for the manner in which the American believers rose to meet the emergency caused by lack of funds for Temple construction. 

 9.     His heartfelt condolences and loving sympathy for the loss sustained in the passing  away of Dr. 

Moody.                     

 10.     These significant words in a letter dated December 1: "Despite the perils and uncertainties with which their country is now beset, and in the face of the financial reverses they have suffered and the unfortunate  controversies that have perplexed and agitated them, they have forged ahead and are fast approaching the termination of the first stage in the ornamentation of their consecrated Edifice. 

 Undaunted by the magnitude of this colossal enterprise, undismayed  by the smallness of their numbers, the scantiness of their resources and the scorn of their enemies, they have carried triumphantly the banner of Baha'u'llah and brought to a successful issue the first stage in the formative period of His Faith." 

 Special attention is called to the fact that the Guardian, in this passage, considers the dome and clerestory sections one unit — a matter of very great importance in the light of the misunderstanding which has prevailed here and there that the dome alone was the ~unit" which the Guardian wished completed and that consequently the clerestory section was a task arbitrarily added by the National 

Assembly.                  

 Observe also that Shoghi Effendi gives new and more striking emphasis to the completion  of the ckrestory section of the dome unit by stating that its successful issue terminates the first stage in the formative era of the Faith. 

 These subjects explained by the Guardian in a letter dated January 27 were reported in Baha'i News of March, 1935. 

 1.     The figures of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-Bahi are not to appear as characters  in dramatic works written by believers. 

 2.     Explanation of the Ba1A'i teaching on


<p85>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             85

  marriage, especially in relation to interracial marriage. 

 Other passages from the Guardian's letters  quoted in March were: 1.     An important reference to the teachings  on economics taken from a letter dated December 20, 1931. 

 2.     The importance of Baha Summer Schools, from a letter to Central States Summer School Committee, dated Novern —  ber 6, 1934. 

    Since the April, 1935     

 issue of the News Letter was devoted to Annual Committee Reports, except for a few news items carried  over in type from the previous number in which space was lacking, a number of excerpts in recent letters have not yet been published, and these will be given in full at this time: 1.     In comment on the ruling that members  of local 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 must be able to attend meetings: CtH believes that your Assembly was well-advised in adopting such a ruling. For it is only too obvious that unless a member can attend regularly the meetings of his local Assembly, it would be impossible for him to discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfil his responsibilities as a representative of the community. 

 Membership in a local Spiritual  Assembly carries with it, indeed, the obligation and capacity to remain in close touch with local Baha'i activities, and ability to attend regularly the sessions of the Assembly." 
(Haifa, January 27, 1935.)

 2.     In a letter written to the Spiritual Assembly of New York in acknowledgment of a letter reporting the local Assembly's decision to uphold fully and without exception  the general instruction concerning Oriental believers who lack proper credentials:  "In this connection, the Guardian wishes to draw once more your attention to the all-importance of his instructions to the Western believers regarding association with Orientals. The friends in the West must be wide awake, and be extremely cautious when dealing with Easterners, particularly with those who in the name of the Cause desire to satisfy their own desires and ambitions.  The first step which they should take in protecting themselves against such mischief-makers is to insist that they should obtain proper credentials from the Assembly  of the locality in which they live. This measure, he feels, is absolutely essential and there can be no exception whatever to it." (Haifa, January 4, 1935.) 

 3.     The cablegram received March 30, 1935, and reported to the friends in a general letter sent to local 

Assemblies on April 3:    

 "Contract for purchase and transfer to Palestine 

Branch American Assembly  

 (of the) Dumit property situated (at the) center (of) area dedicated to 

Shrines on Mt. Carmel     

 (has been) signed. Four year litigation  involving Baha'i world's petitions (to) 

Palestine High Commissioner

Am compelled appeal entire body American community subordinate national interests of Faith to its urgent paramount requirements  at its 'World 

Center."                  

 At the time this Report is in preparation, no further information and no result of that appeal is available. It will be for the Treasurer to convey the result in his Financial  Report. 

 The impressive fact to be noted is the Providential manner in which, at every stage in the development of Baha'u'llah's  Faith, events are provided and tasks are allotted to the believers which prepare them for the new step. The building of the Temple was the divine plan for creating a national Baha'i community out of the local communities and factional groups existing  years ago, and now we are given compelling needs at the World Center in order to create a world Baha'i community out of the national communities which have recently been established. Our collective response to all such successive emergency constitutes our training and discipline for service in a divine 

World Order. The Cause    

 progresses by heroic endeavor and sacrifice and for the believers there can be no stay on the upward march. 

 4.     There is one other recent communication  from the Guardian, but reference to it will be deferred to the conclusion of this Report.

86              THE BAHA'I WORLD

Secondary Administrative   
Developments               

  From time to time problems and situations  are reported by local Spiritual Assemblies which call for some general ruling. The rulings of this character made by the National Assembly during the past year will now be reviewed. 

 Before doing so, however, it seems important  to call attention to the fact that the National Spiritual Assembly after the £934 Convention adopted a new and better method of keeping all its members informed throughout the interval between the meetings. 

 Once a week each member receives a summary of all communications which have arrived at the National Office, and each item in the summary is numbered for identification.  Up to April 19, 1935 there had been 1,124 items, but this figure does not represent the total amount of correspondence because an effort is made to use the same key number throughout all the correspondence  pertaining to the same matter. Hitherto the members were only informed of special matters, the general correspondence being itemized oniy once a month in the form of an agenda for each meeting. This new method has been found to be exceedingly helpful. 

 'The general rulings adopted during the year are as follows: 1. That each local Assembly, in dealing with the matter of members of the community who have joined nonBahA'i organizations  which might be political or even radical in character, is in duty bound to point out to the community the Guardian's instructions as published in Baha'i News of August, 1933. 

 2. Fresh emphasis was recorded for the principle under which a traveling teacher is not only subject to the jurisdiction of the local Assembly in each city, but is expected to be concerned only with teaching activities  and not intervene in local problems unless specifically requested by the Assembly to assist in some situation. 

 3. That the children of believers can attend the Nineteen Day Feasts and other Baha'i meetings, but when they reach the age of sixteen years the local Assembly should request a declaration of their interest m the Cause and their intention to become voting members when they reach the age of twenty-one; and that other young people, not children of believers, can attend Nineteen  Day Feasts and other Baha'i meetings after reaching the age of sixteen years by making a si+nilar declaration to the local Assembly. 
    4.     The functions of the

Reviewing and Editorial    

 Committee were defined, as reported  in Baha'i News of July, 1934. 

 5.     That excerpts from letters written by the Guardian to individual believers will not hereafter be published. 

     6.     National Committees 

 which have occasion to use a printed letterhead were requested to consult the National Assembly in order to use the proper form. 

 7.     That until further notice the annual meeting called on April 21 for the election of the local Spiritual Assembly is to be conducted  by the officers of the outgoing Assembly and not by officers elected by those present at this meeting. 

 8.     In the election of the National and local Assemblies, when the result of the ballot is that eight members are elected but two or more believers are tied for the ninth membership, the second ballot taken to eliminate the tie vote must be limited to voting for one of the two or more names who received a tie vote for the ninth place. 

 9.     The friends were reminded that the Guardian's original instructions concerning letters written to him by local 

Assemblies and National    

 Committees were that such letters were to be sent him through the National 

Spiritual Assembly.        

 10.     Local Assemblies which have no permanent  headquarters were requested to take a Post Office box which can be used as a permanent address for Baha'i correspondence. 

 11.     Local Assemblies were advised to engage expert legal assistance in adapting the local ByLaws to the Religious Statutes of their particular State; and meanwhile that it is advisable and necessary for all local Assemblies without exception to abide by the set of ByLaws approved by the Guardian. 

 12.     Recommended that all local Assem


<p87>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             87

  hues if possible arrange to have a Baha'i address listed in the local telephone directory. 

 13.     General reports from local Assemblies  are to be sent directly to the N. S. A. but reports confined to teaching activities are to be sent to the Teaching 

Committee. Inter-Assembly  

 Committees and conferences have no executive capacity and therefore  do not receive reports nor transact business. 

  14.     When a local Assembly

 wishes to secure the services of any teacher from another city it is requested to consult the National Teaching Committee. That Committee, in turn, is requested to recommend oniy such teachers as conform to the following  qualifications: thorough knowledge of the Teachings; complete loyalty to the Administrative Order as outlined in the Guardian's general letters including the World Order communications; rigorous obedience to the principle that teachers are not to intervene in any local problem, and true sincerity and severance. 

 15.     That local news letters should be distributed only to menThers of the local community, but copies sent to the 

Guardian,  the National   

 Assembly and to other National Assemblies for their information. 

 16.     That local Assemblies, in transmitting  to the N. S. A. reports and recoin-mendations from the community, should be not merely a passive medium used by believers to bring matters to the attention of the N. S. A. but should make their own independent study of such recommendations and forward them with a statement of their own attitude and comment. 

 17.     Interpretations of the ByLaw on residential qualification of voting believers: first, that when a member or officer of a local Spiritual Assembly cannot function for an indefinite period, and there is no certainty of return to service, the Assembly should recognize the vacancy and arrange a meeting of the community to elect a new member; and second, that the requirements of residence as one of the qualifications of a voting believer should be based upon definite proof of capacity to associate with the Baha'i comMunity. 

 1 8. That hereafter the annual voting list furnished by each local Assembly should be accompanied by a separate list of all believers  transferred to and from the Assembly. 

   19.     That local Assemblies

 are to instruct new believers in the meaning of the new compilation of excerpts from the Will and Testament of CAbd~1Bh~ and furthermore, that local Assemblies are to be responsible for providing new believers with copies. 

 The above rulings have been published in Baha'i News during the year, but those following have not yet been published. 

     20.     That local Assemblies

 are requested to send to the N. S. A. a copy of all important  notices covering policies, rules or regulations  as well as important announcements having to do with elections and organization  under Baha'i administration, which they may issue to their communities from time to time. 

  21.     That the Committees

 in charge of the three Summer School programs are, after this season, to send their programs and arrangements to the National Assembly, which body will publish them in some uniform style. 

 22.     That the collective activities of Baha'is, with which the name Baha'i is associated, ought not to be extended to activities of non-Bah6Ns which cannot be controlled by the believers through their institutions and under the recognized principles  of Baha'i administration; and further that the public solicitation of funds under Baha'i auspices, irrespective of the worthiness of the object, may give a wrong impression of the nature of the Cause. When believers wish to show a special respect  to any nonbeliever or nonBaha'i organization, they should do so as individuals without involving the name of the Cause. 

 23.     In view of the apparent tendency of certain teachers to designate themselves as "International" Baha'i teachers or lecturers, it has been voted to publish in Baha'i' News a brief statement discouraging the use of the descriptive term "International" in connection with Baha'i service, on account  of the fact that the word (tInter national" with reference to the Cause is


<p88>
88              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  properly confined to certain specific institutions such as the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, and to the activities carried on in and through these bodies. 
                           
    General Statements         

  In addition to specific rulings required for definite situations, the National Assembly  endeavors also to throw som~ light on more general trends and developments noted from time to time in its correspondence and other contacts with the national community. 

 During the year, statements have been published on the following subjects: 1.     Status of the National Baha'i Fund.. 

 2.     Suggestions on the subject of teaching. 
    3.     The institution of the

Spiritual Assembly.       

 4.     The new attitudes and principles of action which the Guardian has established in the World Order communications. 
     5.     The nature of the Nineteen

Day Feast.                 

 6.     Preparation of new believers for membership  in the Baha'i community. 

 7.     Important events affecting the Faith in IrAn. 
     8.     Plans for new Baha'i

     General Letters            

  At the beginning of the year the National  Spiritual Assembly planned as far as possible to publish its general letters in Baha'i News so that they could be shared by the entire community. In addition, letters  were sent to local Assemblies on the following dates: June 4, September 5, September  18 (two letters), October 9, 

November  1, November     

 16, December 1, February 4, February 14, March 21 and April 3 — a total of twelve communications. 
                           
   A Summary of Events       

  'Without attempting to evaluate their relative importance, it will be well to record some of the incidents and events which have happened since the last Convention. The complete history of the Cause during the year can only be followed by considering the detailed reports of National Committees, and in addition the records of the sixty local Assemblies and the unorganized groups. 

 1.     Through generous action of certain believers, an obligation inherited by the Green Acre Trustees from the Green Acre Fellowship in the amount of $10,000 payable  on a bond issue has been cancelled by owners of bonds. A loan of $2,000 to the National Assembly several years ago to assist  in financing the printing of The Dawn-Breakers has likewise been cancelled by the lender. The unpaid note of $7,500 held by the bank for loan made in March, 1934, to the N. S. A. for the Temple Trustees has been met by a special gift. 

 2.     The literature has been enriched by several new works, including The 

Promise of All Ages, Security

 for a Failing 'World, Mysticism and the Baha Revelation, the Economics Compilation, The Will and Testament, The Practise of the Presence of God, BAHA'I NEWS Index, and the leaflet, World 

Religion.                  

 3.     A beautiful design was made by Myron  Potter for the Memorial to Keith at 1sf 4h~n, and working drawings sent to the Assembly in that city, but due to the restrictions  imposed upon Baha'i activities in IrAn we do not know what the 1sf ThAn Assembly has been able to do. 

 4.     The house at Maiden, Mass., where the Master visited, has been transferred by the Guardian to Trustees for the benefit of the N.S.A. 5.     Final details are being worked out with John and Louise Bosch for the transfer  of property at Geyserville used for the Summer School, to Baha'i trustees. 

    6.     The three Summer Schools

 have progressed  steadily, and by now are recognized in their true light, as the beginning of the divine Education given humanity by Baha'u'llah. 

 7.     The Symbol of the Greatest Name has been legally protected in the United States and steps are being taken to acquire similar protection in Canada. 

 8.     References to the Cause by non-Ba-


<p89>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             89

  h~i'is in newspapers, books and magazines have considerably increased. 

 9.     The Race Amity Committee, in its article on "The Divine Call to Race Amity" published in Babd'i News for March, 1935, has made available to all the American believers a new and valuable source of information  and spiritual impetus for sucassful service in that field. 

 10.     The public bulletin entitled "A New 'World Order" has been sent to a special list of people of capacity, at intervals of every other month, adding its weight to all other teaching efforts. 

 11.     Many, but not all of the annual Committee Reports prepared last year have been published in successive issues of Baha'i News, affording a background of information  about the progress of activities along national lines. 

    12.     Two new Spiritual Assemblies

 were established on April 21, 1934 — Lima, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana, while a Spiritual Assembly was reestablished at Geneva, New York. 

 13.     A list of Baha'i young people between  the ages of fifteen and twenty-one is maintained at the National Office, and the friends are requested to assist in keeping  this list complete. 

   14.     The National Spiritual

 Assembly has recorded its thanks and appreciation for the valuable services rendered by A. F. Mat-thisen in acting as accountant and preparing  the monthly and annual Financial 

Reports.                 

 15.     A special committee has been giving much time and thought to the preparation of a form of Baha'i parliamentary procedure  for use by local Assemblies in conducting their own meetings and also the Nineteen Day Feasts, for use by the Convention,  and also a procedure for the N. S. A. itself. Action has not been taken on this matter at the date of the writing of this Report, but the matter is mentioned  because the request for such procedures  was one of the important recommendations at the 1934 Convention. 

 It is hoped that the final drafts can all be pub. lisbed, so that every believer can become familiar with the methods for the conduct of Baha'i deliberation. 

    16.     The Baha'i Magazine

 has been issued in a new form, the title and general character  of which reflect the Guardian's own teaching method as developed in his general letter entitled c(The Goal of a New World Order." 

    17.     The National Assembly

 is endeavoring  to work out a settlement with the executor of the estate of Mrs. Agnes Parsons, who wrote her intention of donating property at Dublin, N. H., to the Cause, but did not provide for this intention in her will along the lines of her personal letter. 

 It seems advisable for believers who wish to leave bequests to the Cause to make certain that the necessary legaL steps have been taken. 

  18.     A Memorial Meeting

 to commemorate  the passing of Dr. Moody was held in Foundation Hall, Baha House of Worship, on Sunday, 

November 25.              

 19.     A statement on the Cause is now included annually in the International Year Book published by Funk & Wagnalls, New York. 

 20.     A new series of inexpensive pamphlets  is now under way, for general use in presenting the Cause to the public. The text was prepared under the direction of the Free Literature Committee, and as each article is approved by the Reviewing Committee  it will be published in World Order and then reprinted by the 

Publishing Committee     

 from the magazine types, which makes a large saving in cost. The first pamphlet, on Baha'i Education, by Stan-wood  Cobb, is now on the press. The second  will appear next month, on The Most Great Peace, by Marion Holley. 

 The series will eventually include some six or more titles, and will surely prove very valuable to local Assemblies and individual teachers. 

 21.     The suffering of the Baha'is of Iran has been before the National Assembly unceasingly  for two years. 

 During this period,  under the Guardian's direction, every possible effort has been made to exert influence  for their relief. 

 The situation has now passed into what appears to be a crucial  stage, and we must pray to Baha'u'llah that so grievous a blow at 

His Cause shall Providentially

 be prevented from carrying out the full destructiveness of its intention.


<p90>
90              THE I3AHA'I WORLD

  The matter has been reported as fully as the Assembly has been permitted to make it known among the friends. It is hoped that this Convention, among other actions, may unite in heartfelt prayer on behalf of our fellow Baha'is in that country. 

 22. Let us be grateful for the remarkable  services being rendered by the American  believers who travel in other lands —  Martha Root, Louise Gregory, 

Mountfort Mills, Louise

Sylvia Mat-teson,  Emogene 

 1-Ioagg. On Sunday, April 14, the press carried the news that Mr. Romer had passed on at London — a great loss to the Cause. 
                           
 A New Annual Conference    

  After careful consideration of some of the needs of the Cause, the National Spiritual  Assembly has recently recorded its view that hereafter each successive N. S. A. should arrange a threeday joint session for the special purpose of conferences with representatives of all local Assemblies who can be present. 

 The purpose of this plan is to go more deeply into the opportunities and problems faced by all local Assemblies in this formative  period, and at the same time enable the National Assembly to acquire a more intimate picture of conditions than is possible  by correspondence. 

 The thought is that such a conference could be held during the fall or early winter, at some central point like the Foundation Hall of the Tem-pie,  or Chicago, and each Assembly invited to send a representative or at least some suggestions for the agenda. The meetings would doubtless be helpful to all, and grap-pie  with real problems and opportunities which arise on all sides. It is confidently hoped that the plan when carried out will have important results for the Cause. 
                           
        Conclusion                 

  In conclusion the important announcement  is made that the Guardian has given the friends a wonderful blessing in the form of new translations of excerpts from Tablets  of Baha'u'llah. 

 Within the last few days three different manuscripts have been received from Haifa, and with them a letter  stating that these are to be published with the title ttGleanings from the Writings  of Baha'u'llah." It would be presumptuous  to attempt to describe their power, their beauty, their vitalizing spirit. Suffice it to remark that Shoghi Effendi, having renewed the Cau~e by instructing us in the principles of administrative order, now calls us to a spiritual renewal in our knowledge of the creative 

Utterance of Baha'u'llah.  

 Let us consider this one passage included in the Guardian's translations: "The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is the DaySpring of His Revelation and the fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good; and whoso is deprived thereof, bath gone astray, though he be the author of every righteous deed. It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe  every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world. 
These twin duties are inseparable.

 Neither is acceptable without the other. Thus bath it been decreed by Him Who is the Source of Divine inspiration." 
    Faithfully yours,

Your Majesty:              

  In more than seventy cities of the United States and Canada there are associations of people who feel a special interest in and a high and sincere regard for your Majesty's  enlightened r~gime and for the prog

  ress of the Persian people. 

 These Americans do not feel that Persia is a distant country, having at present few commercial relations or public ties with these nations of the West, but on the contrary they feel that Persia is a second Fatherland, the source and origin of a Faith they hold dearer than life itself. 

 By reason of that Faith they exalt the destiny of Your Majesty's nation and are assured that Persia shall, in this new age, become the object of a veneration and a love as the Holy Land whence first came forth the divine 

Message of Universal      
Peace.                    

 With this deep and sincere respect for Persia, Your Majesty is assured that no po-lirical  and no selfish commercial motives are combined. As the followers of Mu-bammad  all through the ages have made spiritual pilgrimage to Mecca, in Arabia, and as the followers of Christ have in the same manner thronged to Palestine, so the followers of Baha'u'llah look upon Persia as the Center toward which their gratitude and their hopes must ever turn. Even though at present other nations possess a larger measure of material wealth and political power, nevertheless the followers of Baha'u'llah feel perfect assurance that Persia  shall, in the not distant future, attain a true preeminence in the hearts and minds of all civilized people, since the development of peoples and nations is subject to the will of God. 

 It is in the name and on behalf of all these American people who are so devoted to the Persian nation that the National Spiritual Assembly now addresses to Your Majesty this respectful petition, appealing to Your Majesty's justice in a matter that deeply moves our hearts and affects our religious 

Faith.                    

 To state the matter in its most essential form, it consists of the sacred privilege of religious worship which has been denied by certain government officials to the followers of Baha'u'llah in Persia, although the principle of religious freedom is granted in the national Constitution and represents what we are convinced is Your Majesty's established policy and intention for the welfare  and development of the entire realm. How far this denial and suppression have proceeded beyond Your Majesty's own pub — lished attitude is made clear by recital of the following facts: —  First, Baha'i books and even letters sent by the American believers to their fellow-believers in Persia are confiscated by the Persian Postal 

Department.               

 Second, Baha'i books printed in Persia are seized and destroyed by Postal, Police or other officials. 

     Third, the Tarbiat School 

 for girls in Teheran, and Baha'i Schools in the cities of Kashan, 

Qazvin and Sultanabad     

 have been closed by order of the Ministry of Education. 

 Fourth, in a number of leading cities, including Qazvin and Kirmanshali, public orders have been issued prohibiting Baha'i gatherings, closing Baha'i meeting places and suspending Baha'i activities. Likewise in these cities the orders even deny to Baha'is the right of burial in Baha'i cemeteries. 

 Fifth, the Baha'is of Teheran are compelled under penalty of imprisonment to register as Moslems in their identity papers. 

 Sixth, the Moslem clergy, elated by the opportunity to arouse public prejudice against the Baha'is, are inciting the population  to injure and oppress the innocent followers of Baha'u'llah. 

    Seventh, the Baha'is     

 of Teheran have made effort to present a petition to Your Majesty, but their petition has been undelivered and its pleas rejected. 

 Therefore we, Your Majesty, relying wholly upon Your Majesty's justice and upon the spiritual nature of the Faith we hold in common with the Baha of Persia and other lands, respectfully seek this opportunity  to prove that Your Majesty's Baha'i subjects are loyal and innocent, and that they are made victims of a religious fanaticism which developed many years ago before the great blessing of religious freedom was given to Persia in Your Majesty's noble constitutional reform. 

 The proof we desire to submit is not based upon mere words but upon deeds. 

 Reference is accordingly made to the remarkable services rendered to Persia by that venerable and loved Dr. Susan Moody, who so recently died in the city of Teheran. From the year 1909 even to her last hour,


<p92>
92              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  this American Baha had no other thought than that of the development of the Tar-Hat  School for Girls in Your Majesty's capital  city. Through her love for Persia, inspired by her devotion to Baha'u'llah, Dr. Moody was given the great historical privilege of establishing the first educational institution for girls in that land. 

 Her achievement has become known and deeply admired throughout the civilized world, and her firm intention of dying and being buried in Persia, her chosen field of service, was acclaimed in articles published by newspapers of Teheran following her death. We cannot believe that Your Majesty wishes the heavy hand of prejudice, and the blind venom of clerical hatred and jealousy, to destroy what so many years of pure intention and sacrifice created for the sake of Persian girls, whose education the Moslem clergy itself has never attempted nor even desired. It is surely the characteristic of true civilization to open schools and not to close them. 

 Now as for the true attitude of the Persian  Baha'is toward Your Majesty's reign and Your Majesty's government. 

 The spiritual teachings of Baha'u'llah, Your Majesty, specifically and positively inculcate in all Baha'is the principle of obedience to their civil ruler and government, in whatever country Baha'is reside, and complete noninterference in political affairs. 

 No Baha'i for any reason whatsoever  is permitted by his Faith to take part m any political faction or have any association with radical movements. 

 We ask Your Majesty to note this most essential Baha'i principle, because it can be found in no previous religion. This Baha'i teaching  is no less than the greatest of blessings for the rulers and governments of this age, since no 'esson is more clearly taught by history than the evil results of the disorders and rebellions originating in religious prejudice.  No such results can ever, in any country, arise from the actions or even thoughts and feelings of the Baha'is. 

 Moreover, the spiritual teachings of Baha'u'llah remove the very foundation of that inter-religious strife which throughout history it has been so difficult for civil governments to control, as for example the centuries of dissension which have existed between 

Christians and Moslems.    

 The followers  of Baha'u'llah are taught that both Mubammad and Christ are Prophets and Messengers of God, and that true faith in one requires equal faith in the other. They accept and abide by the Baha'i teaching that declares an end must come in this new age to all those false religious doctrines, not revealed by the Prophets but advanced by the leaders of church and mosque, which justify in the name of God the present separation and antagonism of the religious sects and creeds. 

 Thus, the Baha'is of Christian countries revere and extol Mu —  bammad, and gladly endure suspicion and scorn from orthodox Christians for the sake of the spiritual unity made possible by the teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 Yet the Baha books published in America, which dare to exalt Muluiammad among people who believe that Muhammad is the enemy of Christ, are banned and forbidden entry in Persia by the leaders of Islam who are themselves unable to prove the Prophethood of Mu-bammad  to the Christian peoples! 

 From the point of view of enlightened civilization, Your Majesty, it is desirable to refer to one more important teaching of Baha'u'llah, namely, that teaching which forbids the Baha of all countries ever to allow the development of a priesthood or professional clergy in this worldwide Faith. No spiritual principle could be more acceptable to an enlightened Monarch than this, since it has ever been from the clergy, and not from the people, that those false doctrines have arisen which serve to instigate hatred and enmity where the Prophet himself  has taught oniy friendship and peace. 

 Your Majesty is assured that the American  Baha'is and the Baha'is of Persia possess  the same Faith, follow the same teachings and carry on their religious services in the same manner. 

 The Faith of Baha'u'llah is uniform and identical among all the believers in the forty countries where this Faith exists today. Therefore if true and complete reports cannot be obtained in Persia, on account of the active prejudice so long fomented by Moslem leaders, we appeal to Your Majesty and plead that the true character of our religion be established by


<p93>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            93

  Your Majesty's representatives in America or other countries. 

 For example, the American government recognizes the Baha'i Faith as a new religion, allows the American believers full freedom to maintain their Baha'i institutions and activities, and has never found any evidence that the religion of Baha'u'llah is a source or cause of difficulty  to the national kgirne or to the public  order and general welfare. When the truth is fairly ascertained, we have complete  confidence that Your Majesty's justice and concern for the progress of civilization will cause the Persian Baha'is to be saved from religious persecution and to be given liberty to maintain their spiritual institutions without interference, including those Schools in which innocent children have received  instruction in the sciences and arts so necessary to the progress of society, and also in those religious principles of love and unity which are even more essential to a humanity now everywhere in the world confronted by dangers of disastrous war and revolution. 

 What we above all wish to testify, Your Majesty, is that the spiritual teachings of Baha'u'llah emphatically deny the false truths on which Communistic doctrines and practices are based, and declare that no sound and enduring justice can be established  until the supreme evil of international war has been banished from the earth. The Baha'is are convinced that should another  'World 'War be precipitated, civilization itself can be destroyed. 

Therefore, the Baha      

 in all lands serve the ideals of spiritual  fellowship and unity which God has instituted as the sole protection of mankind. The responsible and farseeing statesman, concerned with the larger issues of public order and progress, can by investigation fully satisfy himself that the Baha'is in all countries uphold principles upon which ruler and governments can establish a firm basis for social development, while the religious  enemies of the Baha'is, seeking special privilege and domination over the minds and hearts of the people, are in fact hoping to restore their former condition of authority and are thereby hostile to all public education and constitutional order. 

 They violently assail the Baha'is, then accuse the Baha'is of disturbing the peace of the realm. 

 Such has been the method of the cunning hypocrite in all ages, as Mu]~am-mad and Jesus have lamented in their Holy Books. 

 We therefore express the deepest hope and confidence, Your Majesty, that measures will be taken to relieve Your Majesty's loyal subjects, the Persian Baha'is, who constitute  the largest religious minority in Your Majesty's realm, of the burdens which have been laid upon them of such grievous nature as to carry the stigma and hardship imposed oniy upon vile criminals and those who secretly plot their country's overthrow and destruction. 

 'We likewise make appeal, Your Majesty, that the Postal Department be instructed to permit the entry of letters and books sent by the American Baha'is to their fellow believers  in Persia, and the dispatch of correspondence from the Persian Baha'is to us. The noble sacrifice made for Persia by the late Dr. Moody is surely evidence that our intercourse and association with the Persian Baha'is has sincere intention and beneficial result. 

 The death of Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehier,  also an American Baha'i, and her burial at I~fiMn during 1933, is one more sacred bond uniting the hearts of the followers  of Persia's Prophet, Baha'u'llah, in these two lands. 

 We are, the well wishers of Your Majesty's  nation and people, 

The National Spiritual     

 Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada.

94              THE BAHA'I WORLD

           REPORT PREPARED BY THE NATIONAL
              SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY OF THE
                   BAHA'IS OF IRAN

 EARLY in the Baha'i year 91 (1935 A.D.), the former Central Assembly of IrAn, following the Guardian's instructions sent out a circular letter to all central Local Assemblies of Baha'i districts throughout the country, containing instructions as to the election of the ninety-five Convention delegates. 

 On the 6th of Ridvan when the first session of the Convention was held in Tihnin, eighty-one delegates were present, this number increasing by the second session to eighty-four. 

 The Convention continued with utter spitituality for eight days, and the delegates  felt and showed great happiness, and praised the power of Baha'u'llah, so manifest  among them. 

 The gathering of these men from remote and mutually isolated communities, their harmony in spite of differences of language and race, their coming together with unequaled love and sincerity  to consult over the affairs of the Cause, offered a striking symbol of Baha'i oneness and human brotherhood. The unity of these sessions drew those present like a magnet and its effect is still a living thing. During the first session the following telegram  was sent to the Guardian: "Eighty-one  delegates present humbly soli cit divine confirmation." 

 The Guardian wired in reply:  ~~Jrnp1ore assistance and favor for chosen delegates. 

(Signed) Shoghi."         

 Following a study of the Guardian written instructions, reviewing of the related sections of the ByLaws of the National Spiritual Assembly of America and careful discussion, in the fifth session (after chanting of the Visitation 

Tablet of Baha'u'llah)     

 with prayerfulness and humil-. ity the following were elected by secret ballot as members of Pin's first 

National Spiritual Assembly:

 The National Spiritual    

 Assembly's first act was to telegraph the 

Guardian:                 

  ctNational Spiritual Assembly elected implores  confirmation." 

 The following was received in reply: "Greatest aim and crowning  act is purchase of land for first national Thin Temple. Delay would jeopardize this vital matter. (Signed) 

Shoghi." The new Assembly 

 in its first session elected its executive officers (Chairman, Valiyu'11Th Kh6n Varq&; Vice-Chairman, 

Dr. Yiinis Khin Afr6khtih;
Sec'retary, tAli-Akbar Kh~n

 Furnan), and in the course of this and later sessions appointed its committees as follows: Census; Teaching; 

Children Training; Publicity;
Unity of East and W%st;   

Youth; Pin Mashriqu'l-Adhkar; Women's
Progress; Committee for   

Copying Tablets; Savings  
Bank.                     
  Work undertaken by the    

National Spiritual  Assembly

 in the year 91 included the following: establishment of a special body to study and translate the ByLaws of the National Spiritual Assembly of America; the translation made was then submitted to the Guardian for final revision. 

 Purchase  of the land for Iran's first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in accordance with the Guardian's instructions; this land consists of a property known as 1{adiqih (Paradise), situated among the Shimrin hill-villages on the slopes of the Alburz Mountains, about six miles to the northeast of Tihrin, and commanding a beautiful view of the city; at present, pending the construction of a direct road at some future time, it may be reached in twenty minutes by auto from the capital. The land, acquired at a cost of 176,000 riy6is, is a tract of 1,257,000 square meters, and unlike most parts of Shimr~n it is relatively ievei and fertile; two subterranean water courses (Qan~t) come to the surface on this land, and in addition it has an allotment by law of 161 hours of purchased water, which is ample for irrigation of the garden and some of the farm area. 

 Purchase of a vineyard adjoining the Hadiqili. Dispatch of two traveling teachers through IrAn to supplement the work of local teachers.

  tion of petitions to His Majesty the ShAh and to the Government authorities regarding  the following occurrences: The closing of all Baha'i meetings in some of the provinces, including Khuds~n; the confiscation by police authorities of the Baha'i pocket calendars which had been printed and spread in TilirAn; seizure in the publishing office of the book "Mysterious Forces of Civilization" which had been printed and was being distributed through the efforts of one of the friends; dismissal of some Baha'i employees from the Department  of Highways in Ahv4z, Khiizistin; public denunciation of the Cause from the pulpits in the mosques of AhvAz by one of the mulhs, in the presence of civil and military heads; seizure in the post offices of Spiritual Assembly correspondence; the spread of articles and caricatures directed against the Cause, some printed in Idn and others abroad; the refusal by registry offices to register Baha'i marriage certificates in spite of full observation by Baha'is of all stipulated regulations; the refusal of some departments of the Ministry of Finance to employ Baha'is as a result of the latter's filling in the religions column of their application blanks with the word ccBh~~i~~ the closing of the Tarbiyat Schools in Tihr~n because of their having closed to commemorate the martyrdom of the Bab (ShACbin 28) and the subsequent closing of the following Baha'i schools throughout the country: Qazvin, Tavakkul School (girls) 

; K~shin, Vahdat-i-Bashar  
Schools (boys and girls);  

Arin-i-KisMn Macrifat Schools

 (boys and girls); HamadAn, Ta'yid High School (boys); Mawhibat School (girls) 

; Najafibid, S&idat Schools

 (boys and girls) ; Sangisar and ShahmirzAd, Boys' and 

Girls' Schools and Kindergartens;

 Yazd, Tawfiq Tahdhib Hfishangi, Tarbiyat Schools (boys and girls); Bibul, Sat~dat-i-Umfimiyyih 

School; Ab5dih, Tarbiyat Schools

 (boys and girls). The suppression of all Baha'i gatherings throughout the country; closing of the Baha'i meeting houses (Haziratu'1-Quds) in all localities; imprisonment of a number of Baha'is and even the subjection of some to physical injury; refusal of telegraph offices both in the capital and throughout the provinces to transmit to the authorities petitions of appeal from persecuted Baha'is. Throughout this year the National Assembly further sent regular reports to the Guardian, spread his instructions among the friends, corresponded with Assemblies at home and abroad, encouraged Baha'i institutions and individuals to carry out the Guardian s instructions  and to remain firm in spite of adverse pressure; as directed by the Guardian, the National Assembly also distinguished  between purely administrative matters and matters of faith and conscience,  summoning the friends to complete obedience to the Government where administrative  affairs were concerned, and full observance of their religious laws in matters of conscience; it further endeavored to console  and sustain them in their difficulties and to encourage their strength and harmony.  When the schools were first shut down and the restrictions imposed, the National Assembly also dispatched Aqiy-i-ThThit  to the Guardian to receive his instructions (no other means of communication being available) ; it has likewise met frequently with Government authorities with reference to the occurrences described. 

 The following are extracts from Assembly  reports regarding the abovementioned occurrences. 

 Tihr~n: it is reported that the National Police Department issued a circular order to its local departments in the capital and throughout the country to the effect that all public declaration of faitb by Baha'is should be strictly suppressed, that all their meetings and organizations should be dissolved, that everyone calling himself a Baha'i should be arrested and prosecuted. 

 Following these orders pressure began to be exerted on the Baha both in Tihrin and throughout the provinces; all Baha'i meetings, whether in private homes or in the Haziratu'1 — Quds, and even certain of the children's character-training classes, were banned; individuals in whose homes meetings were customarily held were required  to sign a pledge to the effect that these would be discontinued; some of the friends were summoned to district police departments and told to desist in future from calling themselves Baha'is; regarding this point the authorities would severely


<p97>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             97

  reprimand the friends but seeing them unmoved by threats would let the matter drop. Certain minor officials made use of the situation to serve their own ends and to introduce their personal views. For example, when a Baha'i youth whose bicycle had been stolen referred to the district police, the officers in charge asked him to what religion he belonged; learning that he was a Baha'i, the Chief roughly upbraided him, saying, "So you're still declaring yourself  a Baha'i! Haven't you heard that no one has the right to breathe that word any more!" The young man answered simply, "I am a Baha'i, and how could I help saying so when you asked my religion?" 

 The result was that the theft of the bicycle was ignored and the young man who had come to recover his property was imprisoned. Similar incidents have repeatedly occurred in Tihr~n. Certain TihrTh newspapers and magazines have both outwardly and by implication attacked the Baha and the Tarbiyat Schools in libelous articles; in particular  Sharitat~i~Sangalaji, one of the religious leaders who exerts an influence over Muslim youth, spoke from the pulpit these words which were later published verbatim in the magazine ~ "Last night I heard a report which so delighted me that if I had the means I would strew the floor of this mosque with sweets. 

 It was that His Imperial Majesty our powerful SMh has ordered the closing of their girls' and boys' schools. 0 People, this is indeed a matter for thanksgiving! Think what would happen to our Muslim children who would attend those schools. May God Himself assist our mighty and exalted ShAh!" At the same time ~ Ayati (Av4rih) in his magazine ttNamak-din" did not hesitate to publish the worst sort of slander and libel. 

 Qazvin:     the delegate from the Qazvin Assembly states that following the closing of the Tavakkul School a Government-school  teacher in addressing his class turned th~ subject to the Baha'i Cause and the Baha'is, and began to vilify the Cause, finally shouting with the students, "May God curse the enemies of the Prophet!" after which the class repeated "So be it!" When one of the Baha'i students objected to the teacher's action, the teacher and superintendent and later the District Director of Public Instruction intervened and the Baha'i student was expelled from the school. 
     KAsMn:     on .&dhar 22nd the

Chief of Public Safety     

 accompanied by the Chief of Police and a number of officers and department inspectors went to the 

Baha'i Vabdat-i-Bashar     

 Schools for boys and girls, closing them both. 

 They seized the school equipment,  put out the custodian and imprisoned the school principal for three days at police headquarters, certain of the officials insulting  and abusing the Baha'is. Following closing of the schools all Baha'i meetings were banned. 

 Najaf4b~d:     here the representative of the Vice-Governor proceeded to the Baha'i schools, gave a verbal order to close them and had the schools' signboard taken down; at this the director and directress addressed the students, informing them that the suspension of the schools was due solely to their being Baha'i institutions. The students, many of them in tears, left for their homes, even the Government officials being visibly affected by their distress. 

 Mashhad:     after forbidding all Baha'i gatherings, arresting the members of the Assembly and a number of others and then releasing them on bail, the Chief of Public Safety summoned a representative of the Assembly and said, "Your meetings are to be dissolved for all time, and even the building which is your Ua~iratu'1-Quds must be sold so that no trace of this may remain." It is obvious that since these orders were not is sued by the Government but were actuated by personal views, none were made effective. 

 Yazd:     during this difficult period the officials in charge of the Government Census and Identification Bureau attempted to oblige the Yazd Baha'is to register themselves  as Muslims and the Baha'is refused to do so. Among others cAta~u~11~h Vujdini-NizMd was summoned to the police station and ordered to fill in the religions column of the identification form with the word t!Isl~m~~ and sign it; upon his refusal to comply, the officials agreed that he should


<p98>
98              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  leave the space for religions entirely blank or should draw a line through it and sign the paper; he replied that he would not sigh unless he could fill in the column with the word "Baha'i." The Chief of Police began to argue with him urging him to do as directed, but seeing that his words had no effect on Vujd~ni, he struck him about the head several times and committed him to prison. It is reported that Vujd~ni said to the Chief, "My father died for this faith rather than conceal it — do you expect me to recant because of your blows and imprisonment?" 

 Following this episode the friends here all registered as Baha'is. 

 Abidih:     with reference to declaring their religion in the census blanks the Baha of this city telegraphed the Governor of Firs to say that even if all the Baha'is, young and old, should be put to the sword they would never sign any other name than CcBaM~i~~ in the religions column of the census forms; the Governor thereupon  ordered local authorities to allow the Baha'is to register as such. 

 Rafsanjan (Kirmin) here the restrictions  imposed were of such severity that even the meeting of two Baha'is in a shop was objected to. Sirjin (Kirmin) here the house-door of one of the believers was defiled during the night. SabzavAr: the entire Spiritual Assembly of this town was imprisoned for several days and afterward released on bail. All Baha gatherings were forbidden. CIr~q: here the police not only put a stop to all Baha'i meetings and administrative activities, but also seized the Assembly's books and archives, removed them to Headquarters and have never returned  them. 

 They further confiscated and retained for a long period the furniture of the Haziratu'1-Quds. 

 Maldyir:     the local Chief of Public Safety summoned a member of the Spiritual Assembly and said that he had confidential news to the effect that all the Baha'is in Tihr~n were under arrest, that they were being put in prison and tortured and persecuted,  and that the Government was determined to obliterate the name from the face of the earth; "You must," he added, tturge your friends to adopt one of the recognized religions, otherwise they will all be destroyed." On the following day the Chief summoned the entire Assembly and addressed them roughly, saying, c(You must give me a list of the names of all the Baha'is in Malayir and on leaving here you must adopt one of the recognized religions." A member of the Assembly answered, (CIS it possible for you to take a raisin and whip it into a green grape? We are unable to obey your order; do whatever you think best." 

 The MalAyir believers were subsequently  so much oppressed that they were unable even to organize their Assembly. 

 •Correspondence from other parts of IrAn, omitted here for the sake of brevity, reports similar episodes everywhere. 

 Election of the National Spiritual Assembly  in 92 was effected as follows: according to Article 8 section VI of the National Assembly ByLaws ("Jf in any year the N. S. A. shall consider that it is impracticable or unwise to assemble together the delegates to the National Convention, the N. S. A. shall provide ways and means by which the business of the Convention may be conducted by correspondence or tele-grain."),  the National Spiritual Assembly in view of the abovementioned restrictions and threatening occurrences, finding it impracticable  to assemble the delegates in Tihr 6.n, informed the local Assemblies to advise election of the delegates in each section  according to the procedure of the previous year, and cause the delegates to dispatch their votes by reliable means to the capital. On the 4th of Jamil, 92 the outgoing National Assembly held its ninety-second  session; seventy-eight ballots had been received by this date, and the following were elected as the National Spiritual Assembly for the year 92: tAli-Akbar Khin Fur6tan (68 votes); 

Valiyu'llih Khin Varq5    
(67); Dr. Yiinis KMn      

 Af&khtih (61)   Shuc&u~11ih Khin tAh" 

(56) Arnin-Amin (54);     
Ahniad Khin Yazdini       
                          
'Iniyatu'llih Khin Ahmadpfir
(43); Mabnvid KhAn Badi'i 

 (37). Following counting of the ballots the outgoing Assem-My  officially notified each new member of his election, and relegated affairs to the new body. 

The incoming National     

 Assembly held its first meeting on the 27th of Jamil,


<p99>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             99

  electing its officers (Chairman, Varq~; Vice-Chairman, 

Afnikhtih Secretary, Funitan;

 Treasurer, tAh'i) and wiring to the Guardian: "National Spiritual Assembly elected implores divine confirmation." 

 Referring  to this the Guardian later wrote, ~tJ wired an answer to that telegram and there is no doubt that the authorities withheld it." During this first session the incoming Assembly further appointed a committee of five to select the membership of the National Committees, the following committees  being appointed: 

Teaching; Children's      
Training; IrAn Temple;     
Census; Shrines; Baha     
Properties; Library;       
Unity of the East and      

West; Reviewing; Youth; Publicity.

 Following are extracts from Assembly reports regarding continued restrictions imposed  on Baha'is throughout the country: TihrAn:    as heretofore, no public meetings have been held in the Haziratu'1-Quds, except  that on the eve of the ascension of Baha'u'llah, some four hundred Baha'is with the approval of the Local Assembly were admitted by written invitation to the Haziratu'1-Quds for dinner, and remained there to chant prayers and sacred verses until three o'clock in the morning. 

 Baha'i meetings continue to be held regularly in private homes without any opposition from the police. Character training classes, teaching meetings, national and local administrative meetings are regularly held. Baha'u'llah: here the police authorities subjected the friends to ill-treatment and in one way or another persecuted several of the wellknown Baha'is. tlniq: local believers  have suffered more through the recent restrictions than those elsewhere. The 

Police and Census Departments

 have pursued the friends with extraordinary fanaticism. 

 As an example the police summoned AqAy-i-Zargarzidih, Secretary of the Assembly, arrested him and placed him in such close confinement that he was not even permitted to see his child. Qazyin: the local police have strictly forbidden  Baha'i community and business meetings. 

 They summoned and reprimanded one of the Babi'is who had held a meeting at his house in commemoration of Baha'u'llah's ascension. 

 The police further made inquiries of two Baha'is with reference to the Baha'i calendar, subsequently holding its publishers prisoner in the capital for two days. 

 Rasht: by order of the Tilirin authorities, two ranking Baha'i officials of the 

Post and Telegraph Department 

 here who were members of the Spiritual  Assembly were forbidden to attend its sessions. ZThidin: here the Vice-Governor ordered the Baha'is to evacuate the Hazi-ratu'1-Quds, lease it to a non-Bahi'i and discontinue all Baha'i gatherings in private homes. 

 Following this order, three members  of the Spiritual Assembly were placed under arrest, and later released. Kirmin: the local police showed great opposition to the Baha'is, and the lowest elements of the populace publicly abused them. 

 Adhir-biyj~n:  after forbidding all Assembly sessions and general meetings in the Ua?i-ratu'1-Quds, the police here refused to grant recommendation cards to Baha'is (The Inn Government grants such a card to citizens in good standing who require the same) on the grounds that being a Baha'i in itself constitutes misconduct. HarnadTh: a number of local believers who did not possess a Muslim marriage certificate (such a civil certificate being a recent requirement) were prosecuted when applying  for identification papers for their newborn children. One believer was further brought to trial for refusal to include  the word ~tMus1im" in his census papers. 

 These individuals were convicted in the lower courts and their cases were appealed. 

 As an instance of the difficulties attendant on registration of Baha'i marriage certificates, the following letter from the Local Assembly of Bandar~cAbb~s is cited: on Qudrat 1, 92 (Ab~n 

12, 1314) Khalil-i-Nid&'i  

 and Mariyam Khinum, daughter of the late QuHm-Ridi Sami-'zAdih  were married as directed by the Guardian according to Baha'i law, and five days later in conformity with Government regulations the marriage certificate was taken to the Municipal Bureau for registration, following which it was to be registered  at the Census Department (there being no local official marriage registry). After several days of delay and promises by


<p100>
100             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the officials that they would register the certificate and give notice of the same, on the 1st of Adhar one of the witnesses was summoned to the Municipal Bureau and asked about the subject-matter of the certificate  and where and by whom the marriage was performed; he answered that according to the Baha'i Faith there is no special individual who performs the marriage ceremony, it being necessary only that the ceremony be held in the presence of nine witnesses, and that this wedding took place in the bride's home. 

 On successive days the remainder of the witnesses were called in and likewise questioned. They then declared that the marriage had not been performed according to the country's regulations; the friends replied that they had acted according to their religious requirements, following which they had complied with Government regulations by submitting the marriage certificate for registration at the Municipal Bureau. The authorities then summoned the bride and questioned her; she answered fearlessly that she and her husband were both born of Baha'i parents, had acted according to their faith and had then submitted their marriage document for registration, adding that the authorities could register or not as they saw fit, since she and her husband had in any case complied with the regulations. 

 They then asked, ""What is a Baha'i" and she replied with the Master's words, "A Baha'i is the embodiment of all human perfections." 

 Their marriage certificate is still shelved at the 

Municipal Bureau, and Khalil-i-NidA'i

 has appealed to the District Attorney of Bandar~cAbb4s and to the National Census Authorities. As the local authorities continued to agitate the case, the young couple were obliged to wire the following, signed by themselves and the nine witnesses, to the Ministries of Justice and of the Interior: "We respectfully submit  that on AbAn 12, 1314, we were married in good will and accord in the presence of the witnesses listed below. 

 As we are Baha'is the marriage was performed according to our religious requirements and since there is no official marriage bureau in Bandar-i-tAblAs, we submitted our certifi-gate to the Municipality for registration, after which it was to be filed with the Identification Bureau. Instead however of registering the document they prosecuted us because of our being Baha'is, making a case against us and referring it to the Department  of Justice. 

 We are astonished that such a thing should happen in the era of justice inaugurated by His Majesty Pahiavi when all faiths are treated with impartiality; we humbly request you to order the authorities to cease persecution of these innocent persons." 

 Many instances have been reported of oppression suffered by Baha'is serving in the army; certain of these are as follows: recently tAli-Mubammad Khin Varq~, son of Mirza. 

 Valiyu'llAh Kbin, who was a conscripted officer, was committed to military prison by order of the General Staff, and this was charged to the fact that in connection with the registration of his marriage certificate he had addressed complaints  to the authorities concerned, including the Minister of Justice, who had forwarded his petition to the General Staff as an alleged infringement of military rules and an act of insubordination; the Chief of the General Staff had reported the incident to His Majesty, whereupon orders were issued for Varq&'s arrest; his father then addressed the following petition to His Majesty: "I have the honor to submit that my eldest son tAli-Mubammad Varq4 after the completion of advanced studies entered the 

Officers' Training College 

 last year to finish his term of military service; having concluded his studies there he served as a 3rd lieutenant in the artillery until on the 31st of Murd&d his term of service was completed. 

 On the 4th of Shahrivar he was summoned to Headquarters and although he was no longer in the army and was seeking work in order to support his family, he was arrested and imprisoned by the military authorities. 

 It appears that the cause of his arrest was his marriage, which the Ministry of Justice has declared illegal although it conformed to all the regulations, as is proved by his marriage certificate which was officially submitted to the Registry Office. A Baha'i can never act against the country's laws and the Imperial will, and his conscience forbids


<p101>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            101

  him falsely to represent himself as Muslim, Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian and to register  his marriage on the certificates and at the bureaus reserved for them. Such an act would be disloyalty to the Government and is forbidden by the Baha'i Faith; a Baha'i is obliged to conform to the Baha'i marriage requirements and to seek the registration of Baha'i certificates by the officials concerned; and since hundreds of such marriages  have taken place all over I r4n, and being in conformity with the law have led the Assistant Chief of Police summoned him and the following conversation ensued: (Chief) ttDid you write a petition to His Majesty seeking your son's release?" 

 (VarqA) ccYes~~ (Chief) "His Majesty orders me to advise you that you have already repeatedly been warned to desist from declaring your faith. 

 You have also been informed that His Majesty looks upon you all with favor and is sure of your loyalty, but he does not wish you to make avowals of your faith. 

 2 A Tablet of Baha'u'llah addressed to tAbdu'1-Bahi. 

 (Translation of part of this Tablet appears in ttThe Dispensation of Baha'u'llah," page 43, paragraph beginning with (CO Thou Who art the apple of Mine eye!") to no incidents, my son likewise has proceeded according to the laws of his faith and also of his country. It is certain that in view of imperial iustice and favor, it will not be permitted that a young man of education, who has completed his military service under the law, has married and with a thousand hopes made ready to serve his country; should at the outset of his career for no fault or disloyalty be subjected to such difficulties. 

 I humbly beg His Majesty's order for a thorough investigation  of the legality of this marriage, and, if it agrees with the desire of His Majesty, the order for his release." 

 Three days later An evidence of His Majesty's favor is that a large number of Baha'is are employed in various Government departments; for example Aq~y~i~cA14~i has a very important position in the army, and this is an outstanding  proof of the ShAh's goodwill toward you, but he cannot condone your public declaration of faith. He can never forgive any infringement of laws and regulations,  even on the part of his own son; for instance a few days ago the man who next to His Majesty was the foremost personage  in the country became the object of His Majesty's displeasure and reprimand because he had made a slight departure


<p102>
102             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  from the regulations." 

 The speaker continued angrily, "And now you peopie want to force the Government to give you official recognition. 

 The Government recognizes oniy four religions and cannot recognize you. See how much better off you are than you were thirty years ago. What more do you want?" He repeated these things several times adding that these were not His Majesty's words but his own, His Majesty having only outlined the message to be delivered. 

 (Varqi) "My dear Colonel, I don't understand your motive in speaking as you have. The point at issue is neither the open declaration of faith nor the desire for recognition. 

 My son has been imprisoned by His Majesty's order; I wrote His Majesty and stated the circumstances, submitting  that my son was imprisoned because he is a Baha'i and has married according to the teachings of his religion. No Baha has acted or will act against the country's regulations and the Imperial will. There has apparently been a misunderstanding, for we have repeatedly submitted to His Majesty and the ministers in charge that Baha'is are obliged by their faith to conform fully to Government regulations in all administrative matters; that is, when the Government orders us to serve in the army, pay taxes, work in the Government offices during stated hours or refrain from giving a daughter in marriage before the age of fifteen, a Baha'i is obliged by the dictates of his conscience and religion to obey. However, as regards spiritual matters such as acts of worship and marriage he must obey the laws of his religion; in all that relates to spiritual conduct, such as prayer, fasting and the like, which matters have indeed no concern with Government regulations, a Baha'i will give up his life rather than obey any outside authority. The case of my son's marriage is an example;  he is a Baha'i of the fourth generation,  born and reared in this faith; he has married according to the laws of his religion and has also made out a marriage certificate in conformity with the laws of his country; to what bureau must he take this certificate to be registered? For you have oniy four bureaus for four religions, and this young man is not a member of any of them. What is he to do? If the Government wishes him to give up his faith, that is impossible." 

     (Chief) "The Government    

 has nothing to do with people's religion. For instance, you hold meetings in the tlaPratu'1-Quds and worship according to the requirements of your faith. The Government has no objection. But it cannot overlook your public declarations of faith and it cannot give you an official status; present condi-dons  are not favorable; perhaps in future it will be different." 

 (Varq6.) "Again you speak of public avowals of faith. 

 Such avowals are for children and the ignorant; the Baha'is are a serious people. His Eminence Shoghi Rabbani has stated in a letter to the National Spiritual Assembly that 'both public avowaL of faith and concealment of faith are blameworthy.' 

 So you can be sure that Baha'is neither declare nor conceal  their religion. 

 But consider that both the grandfather and the twelve-year-old uncle of this boy — that is, my father and brother. — were hacked to pieces forty years ago in Ni~iri'd-Din ShTh's prison because they refused to conceal their belief; obviously  my son who is a fourth generation Baha'i will likewise refuse to do so." Rd~u'116h Mawziin, a member of the Naval Officers Division, was for similar procedure in marrying according to Baha'i doctrine and petitioning the authorities when his certificate was not registered, called to the capital, degraded to the ranks, ordered to serve two years in the army as a private and imprisoned pending payment by him of 1,511 tilmAns, the sum spent by the Government for his education. Although newly married and full of hope for his future, this young man quietly and cheerfully accepted what had happened, saying, "Though I am deprived of a rank which to me was of no value, I have gained precious things in the world of the spirit." His father, Mihdi-Quli Mawziin, stated in a letter written to the National Assembly, ttj request you to send someone to Riihu-'lkh  to comfort him and to tell him from me that he must stand firm." 

 Early in Masi'il, 92, the General Staff


<p103>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES          103

  summoned Dr. cAbdu~1~Karim Kh&n Ayidi, an army physician, and advised him that by His Majesty's order he must cross out the word ttBah~'i" written in the religions column of his personnel papers, replace it with the word 'tMuslim" and endorse the change; that failure to comply would result in the ioss of his rank and in imprisonment until he should reimburse the Government for his education — this notwithstanding the notice on the form in question that all answers should be in strict conformity with truth and that anyone writing in a false statement would be severely penalized. Dr. Ayidi declared that he could leave the space blank but that it was impossible for him to fill it in with the word "Muslim." They warned him that refusal would mean ioss of rank, a heavy fine and imprisonment, and urged him in his own interest to conceal  his faith and give up insisting on this point; he answered, ccJf I do as you say, I shall have lied, and the Government would then have no reason ever to trust me. Furthermore, you require army men to swear on their conscience and religion to serve the Government with loyalty and never conceal the truth; how can you attempt to do away with my religion and as a result with my honor, and oblige me to conceal the truth and also to lie?" They repeated that he must cross out the word ccBah~fi~~ and write (CM Ii in its place. Dr. Ay6Ai answered, "I shall never do that, even if you put me to death." 

 At this the officials stripped off his insignia and imprisoned  him. Dr. Ayidi was a prisoner about fifteen days, during which time he smilingly and firmly withstood all adverse pressure. 

 His mother, Munirih Khinurn, expressed no sorrow at her son's imprisonment,  and prepared herself with entire faith and serenity for whatever might come to pass, saying, "My father, the late 

U~Ii Akhiind (The ~Ah-Qab1-i-Akbar

 of RaM-'u'11~h's  tablets), was time and again chained and imprisoned in the path of the Cause, and my husband the late Ibn-i-Abhar likewise suffered imprisonment and chains. What harm is there in my son's sharing this bounty and following his father and grandfather in the path of his Lord?" At last Dr. Ayidi's firmness resulted in their permitting him to leave the religions column blank; his rank was restored and he was reinstated into his former position. It is thought that the Doctor's medical skill and excellent character influenced the authorities in his favor. 

 At this time a circular order was issued by the General Staff relative to Baha'i officers, as follows: "Because inspection of the ten-year identification forms recently turned in discloses that certain officers have described their religion as Baha'i, you are informed by His Majesty's order that the religion with which the Baha'i community identifies itself has no official status, that the word CBh~~i~ should on no account be permitted to appear in the identification forms, that no avowal of their faith should be allowed and that the slightest expression of faith by them should immediately be suppressed and reported to the capital. Officers who in their identification forms or elsewhere describe themselves as Baha'is must if they are conscripts be deprived of their rank and finish their term of service as privates, and if they belong to the regular  army they must after being deprived of their rank be imprisoned until they reimburse the Government for their education.  His Majesty has especially decreed that leaving the religions column blank in itself constitutes a sort of avowal of faith and this too should nor be accepted. Officers may only fill in the blank with the name of one of the officially recognized religions. 

(Signed) Acting Chief      
of Staff, Darghimi."       

 Following this order various officers in the capital and provinces were called to account, some of these being imprisoned and others discharged from the army. Typical cases were as follows: Aqiy-i-Av&rig~n was ordered to the capital from his post in Kurdist~n, and replied  that his mission had not yet been completed; he was then advised by a telegram  in cipher to inform the authorities whether he was willing to change his listing of himself as a Baha'i in his identification papers. 

 Avirig~n wired in reply, ttSince my conscience and duty as a soldier forbid departure from truth I cannot change the


<p104>
104             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  record." On his arrival in the capital he was ordered to cross out the word "Baha'i" and endorse the paper. He answered that he could oniy agree to leave the space blank. As a result he was put under arrest but they finally accepted his suggestion, and released him. 

 Siy&vash Safidvash one of the earliest Zoroastrian Baha'is, reports that his son Kaykhusraw who is a conscripted officer was summoned and told that it was officially forbidden to write the word "Baha" in the religions column of the identification form, and was ordered to erase it and substitute one of the recognized religions. 

 They further asked for his answer in writing, whereupon he wrote the following: "In compliance with the regulations heading the ten-year identification form I truthfully  stated my religion therein, and I pray God to keep me firm in it to my last breath; cwhatsoever He wills is best.' " As a result he was arrested and deprived of his rank, but eventually this was restored; he was released and permitted to leave the religions column blank. 

 ~Arif KMn Kh~dim, also a conscripted officer, was treated in the same way and for the same reason, but after several days of imprisonment he was freed, his rank was restored and he was allowed to leave the religions column blank. 

 Aqiy-i-Earz~nih took second place in the Arsenal Department examinations held to select students for study in Europe; since, however, he had registered as a Baha'i and had refused the authorities' order to change the record, he not oniy lost the opportunity of being sent to Europe but was arrested and is still in prison. 

 Aqiy4n Ahmadi and Jalili, conscripted officers, were likewise ordered by their superiors to cross out the word "Baha'i" from their registration papers and replace it with ttMulim~~ this in spite of the fact that oniy twenty-three days remained of their term of military service; unmoved by threats, they refused to comply, agreeing only to leave the religions column blank. They were then degraded to the ranks, which they accepted gladly; some three days later their rank was restored and they were much praised for their strength of character, but two days following this they were again ordered to wear a private's uniform. 

 Mihdi Khin Varqi, who had recently received employment as a military dentist in the conscript army, upon joining the regiment  and reporting to his commander, had with the latter the following conversation: (Commander) "Are you a 

Muslim?"                   
     (Varq~) ~'No, I am a       

     (Commander) "His Imperial  

 Majesty has ordered that all officers must be Muslims, and that non-Muslims must change to the religion of Islim in order to become officers." 

 (Varq&) N have no desire to become an officer and I shall not change my religion." 

 (Commander) "Four of you people were in the army; of these, three concealed their religion; one refused, and he is still in prison. 

 Why should you make trouble for yourself?" 

 (Varq6j ~ know, sir, that your intentions  are good, but please don't give me any such advice because it will have no effect on me. If you wish to prosecute or imprison me, I am ready for it, and if I must serve as a common soldier, I am also ready." 

 (Commander) "Then I must refer your case to the General Staff for instructions.~~ At this juncture the Commander's secretary  began to offer his advice to the young man. Mihdi KhAn asked, "Would you who are a Muslim be willing to declare yourself a Jew?" 
    (Secretary) (cYes, because 

His Holiness the Prophet   

 has enjoined concealment of faith in time of need." 

 (VarqA) "In our faith, on the contrary, such concealment is forbidden." 

 (Commander) CCDO as you wish, but I must refer your case to the General 

Staff."                    
     Again, 1st Lieutenant      

 Malik-Khusruvi who had served in the army thirteen years, five of these in action, had been for some time an instructor in the Military College and once had among others the Crown Prince as a pupil, although relatively a new believer and except for his sister the only member of his family to be a Baha'i, registered  as a Baha'i and when informed at the College that he must cross this word out and substitute "Muslim" replied as in the

CURRENT BAHA'! ACTIVITIES            105

  other cases described that he could only leave the religions column blank. He was told that this was forbidden, and that he must register as a member of one of the four recognized religions. 

 He answered, ttSince you oblige me to state my religion, write tBahA'i.' 

 " In spite of their insistence, he stood firm. When his papers were submitted to the Chief of the General Staff the latter summoned him and strongly advised him to change his decision, adding, ~U am interested in you and do not wish you to get into trouble." 

 At last the Chief declared that he would take the matter to the SMh. It is reported that on hearing the case the Shah said quietly, ~ never interfere with anyone's religion, but since this man has not obeyed my commands, the provisions  of the circular order apply to him; however, do not imprison him unless he refuses to reimburse the Government for his education." As a result he was expelled  from the army and required to reimburse the Government for the cost of his education. 

 Malik-Khusruvi is thus the first person in whose case the provisions of the circular order were fully applied. The following is a report of his conversation with the Chief of the General 

Staff:                    

 (Chief) ((J am interested in you and do not wish you to suffer misfortune. 

 Give up this idea and don't declare your faith." 

 (Khusruvi) "I have repeatedly submitted that I am making no declaration of faith and that I am ready to leave the religions column blank, but they do not accept this and compel me to state my religion." 
     (Chief) ctAccording to    

Aq~y~i~cAh~i, the Baha'is 
are much attached to      

Inn."                     

 (Khusruvi) "Baha'is all over the world have the same regard for fnin that Muslims have for Mecca, and they consider Inn their point of adoration. 

 I do not think a Baha'i could be a traitor to his country. I am happy to be expelled on account of my religion instead of on the pretext of embezzlement or some such crime. 

 (Chief) ttnwell then, since you are so much attached to Ir6n it is well for you to obey the ShAh's command and register as a Mushm." 

 (.Khusruvi) ~ cannot; my Master teaches me to speak the truth; truthfulness is a principle of my faith. 

 Furthermore, the identification form imposes the condition that unless the questions are answered truthfully the signatory will be court-martiakd;  it is likewise definitely stated in the army regulations that a soldier must tell the truth and the whole truth." 

 (Chief) "It is better for you not to declare your faith." 

 (Khusruvi) N shall leave the column blank." 
     (Chief) "You will be expelled."

 (Khusruvi) "So be it." (Chief) "They will deprive you of your rank." 
     (Khusruvi) "Let them."    

 (Chief) "You may be imprisoned or transferred to the ports where the climate is bad." 

 (Khusruvi) (CIt makes no difference." 

 (Chief) "I see that you don't want to serve in the army." 

 (Khusruvi) N am ready to serve so long as the army wants me; otherwise, wherever I am I shall serve the Government." 

 (Chief) CCJf they expel you from the army, the other Government departments will refuse you admission." 

 (Khusruvi) "It doesn't matter. I can work for business houses." 

 (Chief) "Is suicide allowable in your religion?" 

 (Khusruvi) "No, it is discountenanced." 

 (Chief) "Why then are you trying to die by your own hand?" 

 (Khusruvi) "This is not suicide; it is a matter of conscience and faith." 

 (Chief) C(GO and consult with your elders." 

 (Khusruvi) "This has to do with a religious  command; it requires no consultation." 

 (Chief) !!Go and think it over." 

 (Kbusruvi) "I did not come here without  having thought it over. 

 (Chief) CCIs it not true that every day in one way or another you tell some falsehood? Consider this as one of those falsehoods. For example, if your child begs you to buy him an automobile don't you agree to, although you never will?" 

 (Khusruvi) "No sir, I never give a false promise to my child; for in our faith lying,


<p106>
106             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and especially to children, is strictly forbidden." 

 (Chief) "What do you tell him then?" 

 (Khusruvi) "I occupy his mind with something else." 

 (Chief) CCThi affair will lead to your misfortune." 
     (Khusruvi) "Not misfortune — happiness. 

 The following incidents have been reported  from the provinces: The Spiritual Assembly of Ahviz advises that Dr. Amin Ahmadzidih, Muhammad Najic, Sirr-i-Din tAh'i and Majid-i-5amadi having registered as Baha'is were informed that they must at all costs declare themselves Muslims; they refused, and were given some days time to alter their decision. 

In Shir6z, officers Himmat 

 and Dr. Salrninpiir registered as Baha'is in spite of warnings and threats from their superiors, and stood firm. In Zahidin likewise, Baha'i officers were subjected  to threats and prosecuted for the same reason. In Tabriz, the following letter was received by a Baha'i officer, 

2nd Lieutenant Muhammad    

 Bihiri: ecAccording to order No.  — , officers in filling out identification forms are obliged to name one of the officially recognized faiths in the religions  column, and since the religion of Bah~ has according to this order no official status, you must, therefore, correct your identification papers; you are advised to inform its of your decision and to appear at Headquarters to see the order in question. (Signed) 

Acting Commander." Officer BAHA'I

 wrote in reply: "It is respectfully submitted relative to order No. —  that since mention of the Baha'i religion is forbidden  in the officers' identification form, I request that a second form be sent me to fill in and I shall leave the religions column blank. 

 It is obvious that since I am a Baha'i, declaring myself an adherent of another religion would be untrue and I would consider such a declaration as disloyal to the army and my country." 

 In Bandar~cAbbAs the text of the circular order from the General Staff was officially forwarded to 1st Lieutenant JalAl As6si and he replied as follows: ttWith reference to order No.  —  it is respectfully submitted that the undersigned completed the Officers' 

Training School in Mirza   

 1308 with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant and has in the past seven years of service given full proof of his trustworthiness, as the Personnel Department will testify. Since the recently-distributed ten-year identification forms stated that answers must be in full conformity with truth I obeyed instructions and, being an adherent of the Baha'i religion,  recorded this in the religions column. It is not possible for me to dissimulate; I am a Baha'i and have no other religion." Aminu'lhh Samiti was another of those who omitted to fill in the religions column in the identification forms; it was later discovered that a secretary had filled in the space with the word CCM V " He made a verbal protest and was about to pursue the matter but as this was not deemed advisable, desisted. It is reported that on numerous occasions when Baha'i officers have left the religions column blank, army corps secretaries have later written in the name of one of the four recognized religions. 

 Among the activities of the National Spiritual Assembly and its committees during  the year 92 were the sending out of two traveling teachers throughout Inn; the supplying of teachers to Baha'i centers in accord with the request of various 

Spiritual Assemblies;      

 the presentation of petitions to the authorities relative to the restrictions imposed on Baha'is, and personal interviews with leading officials in the same connection;  the distribution of Baha'i news to the believers; the dispatch of comprehensive instructions to all Local Assemblies to the effect that as directed by the Guardian Baha'i marriages should be performed in full conformity with Baha'i doctrine and the marriage certificates presented for registration at the registry-offices for non-Muslims,  following which they should be submitted to the Government authorities for registration, and that if refused registration the Assemblies should address petition  to the authorities concerned.

  In the month of Abin,      

DAwud Effendi Tuwiq, Chairman

 of the National Spiritual Assembly of ~Ir~q, reached the capital on a visit to the Baha'is of Pin, attended numerous meetings organized by the Service and Feast Committees and greatly inspired the friends with a number of important  lectures. 

 He then traveled to GilAn, MizindarAn, Firs and Adhirb4j5n, returning to Bagbd6.d by way of Hamadin. During his journey he was attended by a group of Baha'is from the capital, and the friends everywhere report that they were much rejoiced by his visit. 

 First among the Baha'is who ascended to the Kingdom during the years 91 and 92 was the beloved Amatu~1~Ac1&, Dr. Susan I. Moody. Upon her departure on October 23, 

1934, the Tihr4n Assembly  

 wired the Guardian and received the following telegram  in reply: "Hearts in East and West are saddened by the passing of Amatu'1-At; she who was chosen by our peerless Master is numbered among the denizens of paradise in the AbhA Kingdom. Her illustrious and constant services forged and fortified the bonds of spiritual union between  East and 'West. 

 All Baha'i centers should hold fitting memorial services; Arnin-Amin shall expend 500 ifimins on my behalf to build for her a tomb of unique beauty. 

(Signed) Shoghi." The      
National Spiritual Assembly

 of America was likewise cabled of Dr. Moody's passing; her body was interred with fitting ceremonies in the Gu1astin-i-J~vid (The Baha'i cemetery of Tilirin) and numerous memorial services were held in the capital and throughout the country, while the tr&n Baha'is also forwarded warded messages of condolence to their fellow-believers in America through the American 

National Assembly. In      

 a letter received by the National Spiritual Assembly some time after the passing of Amatu'1-AlA,  the Guardian writes: CCThis occurrence has filled the hearts of the friends with grief, and I am greatly saddened by the passing of that essence of severance and that altar-fire of divine love. In faith and assurance she surpassed all about her, and for courage and strength she was far famed. The great institutions she founded shall remain a peerless standard. 

 In times to come Baha'i men and women from America and other lands following in the footsteps of that glory of womanhood will hasten to the sacred country of I ran, will with great energy, spirituality and joy perpetuate her resplendent services, and will speak in praise and commendation of her illustrious, unceasing work. The value of these blessed, holy souls is not recognized today, but as time goes on the effect of their worthy efforts and pure spirit will be made known. At this moment her triumphant soul is dwelling in the all-highest paradise, communing with the denizens of the Kingdom about the Almighty Throne; she is looking on her dear ones who were for many years her companions in that land, and she is chanting the words, tWould that my people could know!' Let the friends be comforted in this bereavement, and praise her high and noble qualities in all private and public gatherings, and clet them who act, act in this wise.' 

 Jin4b-i-fldi1-i-Shir~izi, one of the foremost  of the early Baha'i teachers and travelers, a scholar of the first rank and one who served the Cause by night and day, ascended to the AbhA Kingdom in ~Jzzat, 92. His body was with due ceremonies interred in the new Gu1ast~n-i-Jivid, and two memorial meetings attended by men and women respectively were held at the TuIa?Aratu'1-Quds. 

 On the day of his passing the Assembly wired the 

Guardian, "F~di1-i-Shirizi 

 ascended" and the Guardian telegraphed in reply, 'tDeeply grieved at the departure of the renowned beloved teacher; his services shall never be overcome by death. Assure his family of my

 Mirza Taghi KMn Bahin-Ayin, one of the early and much-afflicted teachers and known as Q~jir, ascended in the month of Adhar (1935) and was interred with fitting  ceremonies in the Baha cemetery of TihrAn. 

 In preparation for the elections of the year 93, the present National Spiritual Assembly has sent out a circular letter to all Baha'i centers, requesting the friends to elect their delegates and arrange for their journey to the capital, where the Convention  for the year 93 will meet on the 6th of Ridvan.

  erLo, the Nightingale of Paradise sin get/a upon the twigs of the Tree of Eternity, with holy and sweet melodies, proclaiming to the sincere ones the glad tidings of the nearness of God — " LOOKING back over the vista of the past two years one is impressed with the different notes and varying cadences which are constantly being introduced in the great universal symphony of the "Unfold-ment  of the 

Divine Civilization"       

 of Baha'u'llah.  These years, so rich in experience, so poignant in the history of the life of mankind are at once a definite link in the working out of the divine plan and separate  and unexplored spiritual efforts! They cannot be visioned as a whole — each variation of the glorious melody must be given its own share, its varying nuances emphasized, its overtones duly recognized, its growing harmony of theme and purpose properly evaluated. 

 In his annual report read by the secretary  of the National Spiritual Assembly before the delegates assembled for the Twenty-Seventh Annual Convention of the Baha'is held in Foundation Hall of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in April, 1935, he says: "The spiritual character and controlling principle of the Ba1A'i year now brought to a close were established for us by Shoghi Effendi in these words dated September 16, 1934 —  ~The situation in IrAn which is growing from bad to worse, the necessary measures  which should be taken to insure the uninterrupted completion of the clerestory section of the Temple, the adoption of such measures as will stimulate the teaching campaign in America, the exercise of the utmost vigilance lest the authorities of Soviet Russia inflict any injury upon Baha'i lives and institutions, the extension of any support that may be required to safeguard the interests of the Cause at its most vital and international center to ward off the malicious attacks of enemies from both within and without — these are the outstanding  issues which demand the sustained and concentrated attention of every be-hever.' 

 "Indeed, the successive steps which Shoghi Effendi has taken to train, to instruct and to discipline the Baha Community are all paralleled by a swift continuance of that process of disintegration of human society which has become the more apparent as efforts to attain peace and stability have successively failed. Fourteen years ago the Baha Community was still as a child in the household of civilization, apparently bearing no responsibility for the fate of that household, and therefore concerned only with the joys and sorrows of the child's own growth, the dreams of its own future. Today, with the household in dire confusion and distress, the youth born of the new age is called upon to prove his birthright and demonstrate his capacity to achieve eternal peace, his elders having failed. 

 Thus it is that the outstanding major events of the year mark a diversity of achievement and growth never before chronicled in Baha'i history, nor will new paths fail successively to unroll themselves before the wayfarer in this New Age of unfolding mysteries, for the standardizing


<p109>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES           109

  of those articles of the Faith contained in the unique document of the Will and Testament of !Abdu~1~BabA, and their introduction  to new believers, bind together the fabric of Baha'i Community life in the indissoluble bonds of the Covenant of God. And accompanying the development of the spiritual structure of the Faith the progress of the ornamentation of the dome of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar despite the serious adversities of the financial world, moved on toward completion; a miracle in stone, a miracle in faith, a miracle in devotion and an evidence of abiding love of the faithful followers of Baha'u'llah. Though at this time the dome was not completed the friends were heartened and refreshed by the following cablegram which served as inspiration for the year of work ahead. This cablegram received after the close of the Convention of 1934 was immediately communicated to the friends. It read: —  tAmerican believers' inspired leadership steadily unfolding to Baha'is world over potentialities majestic edifice heralding formative period Faith of Baha'u'llah. Their unerring vision conceived its matchless  design. 

 tAbdu'1-BahA's own hands laid its cornerstone. 

 Their dynamic faith reared its structure. Their sustained self-sacrifice crowned it with immortal glory. 

 May flame their unconquerable enthusiasm continue glowing in their hearts till its naked frame is enveloped in its shining mantle." 

 'What greater inspiration than this? —  Then followed the instruction that as soon as the clerestory of the Temple was completed no further contracts were to be made for the next unit until the full amount of the sum required was in hand. 

 In a letter dated December first, 1934, these significant words appear: "Despite the perils and uncertainties with which their country is now beset, and in the face of the financial reverses they have suffered and the unfortunate controversies that have perplexed and agitated them they have forged ahead and are fast approaching the termination of the first stage in the ornamentation of their consecrated Edifice. Undaunted by the magnitude of this colossal enterprise, undismayed by the smallness of their numbers, the scantiness of their resources and the scorn of their enemies, they have carried triumphantly the 

Banner of Baha'u'llah     

 and brought to a successful issue the first stage in the formative  period of His Faith." 

 Among the major events of the year also must be noted the passing of the venerable,  the beloved and revered Dr. Susan I. Moody in the field of her life work in Tihr~n. Dr. Moody was one of the early believers to embrace the opportunity of strengthening the bond between the East and the West by taking up her residence in IrAn and giving her life to the service of humanity. The national secretary in mentioning the passing of Dr. Moody says: CCH life furnishes the Baha'i world one more example of heroism and consecration a later generation of believers may well take to heart. 

 How fruitful her life was! What noble institutions she developed, what a monument she reared in the lives of youth of lr~n! Even the enemies of the Cause could not withhold their admiration and their recognition of her sincerity! Even officialdom refrained from destructive measures  until her stalwart Baha'i presence had been removed from the scene!" 
                          
   Teaching Activities       

  In no previous year of which there is record were there so many enrollments of new believers as in this Baha'i year. Both in the number of new members added to existing communities, and in number of groups prepared for election of a Spiritual Assembly for the first time, this period was one of remarkable growth. Milwaukee, Chicago, New York and many of the other communities reported enrollments which surpassed all previous years. The teaching of the Cause, reinforced by the mysterious power of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar made more effective by the knowledge of the nature of the Baha'i community, received a vast stimulus, inaugurating a movement forward  surely destined to acquire greater emphasis with every successive year. 
    The annual report of the  

National Teaching  Committee

 comments with gratification on the extension of the Faith, and points out with appreciation the fact that the financial sacrifices made necessary by the


<p110>
110             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  dcv otion to the project of completing the clerestory section of the Temple imposed serious limitations in the teaching field workers, who met the situation with truly sacrificial devotion. The Teaching Committee  report mentions the names of the following friends who have participated in the work of teaching under the direction of the National Committee: Mrs. Dorothy Baker, Mrs. Ruth Brandt, Mrs. Louise Caswell, Mr. Dale Cole, Mr. Roland Estall, Mrs. Ida Finch, Mrs. Elizabeth Greenleaf, Mr. Louis Gregory, Dr. Walter B. Guy, Mr. Leroy Toas, 

Mirza CAli Kuli KhAn Miss  
Alma Knoblock, Miss Fanny  

 Knoblock, Mrs. Laura Luther, Mrs. Gertrude Matteson, Mrs. May Maxwell, Mrs. Loulie Matthews, Mrs. Florence Morton,  Mrs. Ruth Moffett, Dr. Lenore Morris, Mine. Gita Orlova, Mr. Charles Mason Remey, Mrs. Orcella Rexford, Mrs. Lorol Schopflocher, Mrs. A. Y. Seto, Mr. Mark Tobey, Mr. N. Forsyth Ward, Mrs. Shahnaz '*'aite, and Mrs. Georgie Wiles. 

 Under these able exponents of the Teachings  fifteen public teaching campaigns were conducted, while 39 public meetings were held regularly for teaching purposes; 34 study classes were inaugurated for new inquirers  and 37 classes organized for deepening  the knowledge of the Faith among the friends themselves. A careful analysis of the work of the year has proven the most productive method of teaching to be in the fireside groups in the homes, and great stress is laid upon this system, while the National Teaching Committee stroflgly urges that more of the friends assume this responsibility and open their homes for the reading and study of the Word. The annual report also presents for consideration that very few of the Assemblies have embraced  the opportunity to sponsor nearby towns and cities and to become responsible for introducing the Faith into new centers where no believers are registered. 

 The work of the National Teaching Committee over this period, and indeed over the succeeding year, of which an account  will be made later, has been so wonderfully systematized and the entire country so splendidly catalogued that one sees here a true demonstration of Baha'i efficiency in its ideal form. Much teaching has been carried on by correspondence and over four thousand letters written by the various members of the committee must surely some time bear fruit. 

 Perhaps the most important phase of the work of the teachers, whether of the National Committee or in the Local Assemblies, is the preparation of new believers for membership in the Baha'i Community. 
                           
Preparation of New Believers
for Membership  in the    

Baha'i Community           

  To prepare applicants for the right use of their membership in the Baha Community  it was found necessary by the National Spiritual Assembly to clarify the qualifications for membership according to the instructions received from the Guardian and statements have appeared from time to time in the Baha'i News which are a valuable  guide in determining this important step. The following constructive suggestions  appeared in the News for March, 1935: 1. "As years of experience have shown, intellectual acceptance of the formal standards  of the Baha'i Faith alone is not sufficient. 

 A true believer will, in addition, endeavor wholeheartedly to abide by the results of Baha'i consultation as maintained by the institutions of the Cause. A true believer, furthermore, will seek to contribute  to the unity of the entire community, and find his own development in the growth of the Cause, and not attempt to make the community revolve around his own personality, nor himself revolve around the human personality of any one believer. The capacity for spiritual association is not an additional qualification for membership — it is the real test of the believers' profoundest spiritual faith. All teachers responsible for preparing applicants for membership will do well to emphasize this important and vital point, for the aim of Baha'u'llah's Revelation is to establish oneness  of spirit and unity of action throughout the world. 

 2. "An applicant who is enrolled as voting member of a local Baha'i community is thereby given association not merely in that community alone, but by

  his enrollment becomes a Baha'i world citizen — a member of the Baha'i Commonwealth  maintained by the central institutions of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. If he travels, the enrolled  believer is given credentials which will be recognized and honored by National and local Spiritual Assemblies without distinction, whether in the East or the West. How important, therefore, in the preparation of applicants for membership, that they be made conscious of this supreme privilege, this most vital responsibility assumed by all who voluntarily seek the shade of the Divine Tree, who would contribute  to the World 

Order of Baha'u'llah! This 

 consideration is likewise a reminder to all of the present believers, especially those who are members of local Assemblies, how essential it is to avoid merely local and personal  issues and situations which might conceal from an applicant the true universality  of the Faith of God. 

 3• "The same consideration likewise gives due emphasis to the fact that no local Spiritual Assembly is to be regarded as an independent, self-sufficient Baha institution,  but rather as one important link in the series of institutions which constitute the 

World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 Local Assemblies are dependent upon the National Spiritual Assembly, as the National institutions  are dependent upon the Guardian and the 

Universal House of Justice.

 It is because  of this organic dependence that the national ByLaws make enrollment conditional upon final approval by the National Spiritual 

Assembly.                  

 4 ~ order to assure the entrance of each new believer into the Baha'i community upon the soundest basis possible, it is recommended that local Assemblies, wherever conditions permit, provide a final step for the preparation of applicants already interested by home study classes or some teacher's individual instruction. This final step consists in the holding of a special study class under the Assembly's own direct supervision and control, where the applicants  can be trained in the Administrative principles and their knowledge of the basic teachings carefully reviewed. By this method, the new believers will experience the wise and impersonal functioning of the institution, and profit also by contact with other teachers. Later on, when local communities are larger and their collective undertakings more proficient, perhaps all applicants, before enrollment, will be able to receive this final, supervised instruction. At present, conditions vary so much among the communities that this suggestion must be developed in accordance with local circumstances. 

 It would be well, however, for individual members of each local Assembly  to feel a more positive responsibility in following all local teaching activities, visiting each class or group as frequently as possible, in order to have direct knowledge  of this vital aspect of Assembly responsibility. 

 By consultation it would then be possible for the Assembly to assist each group or class conducted by individual teachers in planning their subjects so as to lead up to the central study class held by the Assembly itself. 

 Success depends upon the unity of the Assembly and the willing cooperation of all teachers, old and young, in striving to enlarge the Baha'i community year by year. 

 ~• ((ft has been realized by discerning Baha'is that one essential aspect of Baha community life, the social aspect, has so far remained practically undeveloped. As local communities become larger and more experienced,  their Assemblies will be able to arrange social meetings and gatherings to satisfy the innate human need of friendly association, thus supplementing the Nineteen  Day Feasts and the Anniversaries which at present are the only recognized Baha'i gatherings. 

 The larger local Assemblies might even now arrange occasional feasts, in addition to those in the Baha calendar, to provide occasions for informal association of believers and also to enable applicants to become acquainted with the local community. So far, such informal gatherings have been arranged mostly by individual believers in their own homes, which tends to make the social aspect of the community too onesided and personal, in distinction to the universality of the formal Baha'i meetings. 

The National Assembly      

 regrets deeply that Baha'is are still compelled to develop a social life either


<p113>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            113

  outside or on a basis of restricted intimacy within the Cause. But through social gatherings arranged by the local Spiritual Assembly, the social life of Baha'is will reinforce  and strengthen their spiritual and ethical lives, and moreover such gatherings will not oniy bring the applicants and the older believers together but also demonstrate  the vital fact that Baha'u'llah's Faith, in the Guardian's own words, inculcates a standard which cincline it to neither East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor poor, neither white nor colored.' 

 6. "Last but by no means least in importance  is the fact that when new applicants  are enrolled, not merely are they to be adjusted to the Baha'i community, but the older believers are also to adjust to the new friends. 

 This consideration, in fact, must receive increasing attention as indica-rions multiply that the era of more rapid growth has begun. Courtesy, true Baha'i love and the spirit of cooperation are due every new Baha'i, without the slightest tincture of aloofness, separateness or, on the other hand, undue favoritism, from those who have longer shared the privilege of adherence to the Faith. 

 t~The National Spiritual Assembly offers these remarks as suggestions deserving of thoughtful attention. 

 In no sense are they put forth as rulings or commands, because formal legislation cannot be carried into the realm of the heart and the conscience. In essence this statement is an appeal, an urgent call for new and higher spiritual attitudes on the part of all the members of the American 

Baha'i Community."         

  Teaching and Training of 

Children                   

  In the hands of a most able and devoted committee study outlines for the teaching and training of children have been made available and are widely used throughout the Baha'i 'World; however, these outlines are susceptible of great expansion and should be more generally used as their value is inestimable. 

 Among the material in preparation is a collection of poems for groups of various ages on themes in keeping  with the Baha'i Faith, a selection of stories from the ttD Breakers," Bible stories which Baha'i children should know as well as a collection of stories from Baha'i literature. 

 An interesting development of the work with children has been the exchange of letters between various groups for through this means is born a greater consciousness of unity and oneness in the Faith and a greater encouragement toward study and research. 
                           
       Baha'i Youth               

  This, the second year of the work of the committee for Baha Youth, marked certain  definite accomplishments and determined  certain definite aims and purposes in the pursuit of its ideals. 

 Since the inception  of the Youth work in 1933 communication  has been established with nineteen international groups representing fifteen nations, and with fifty-three local groups. These do not, however, represent adequately the Youth Groups of the world. 

 During the year also the committee issued their first Bulletin designed to reach and interest young people between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one years. By the time the third Bulletin was ready for circulation  the subscription list amounted to three hundred names, showing a marked increase in interest and a growing spirit of cooperation among the various Assemblies. These Bulletins contained valuable suggestions  and lists of publications designed to increase the knowledge of the Faith and provide information invaluable in the formation  of Youth Groups everywhere. Open letters addressed to young Baha'is were published in the Baha'i News and the communications from the Committee became a valuable part of the regular issues of the News. 

 With the decision rendered by the National Spiritual Assembly that youth of sixteen to twenty-one years might declare their interest in the Faith and attend the Nineteen Day Feasts, it became a matter of paramount importance to educate the youth and prepare them for the time when the age of maturity being reached, they might declare their desire to become fully qualified members of the voting community. 

 International correspondence was increas

  ing, and with the Guardian's instruction to create an international body of active young Baha'i men and women" the committee arose to accept the challenge and have bent every effort in that direction. Work for peace is always one of the main issues, and cooperation with the tcHerald of the South" established a link between the two continents which will become more and more intimate as time goes on. It is with a sense of the greatest gratification that those believers who form the older generation and even the pioneers in the Faith in America are now witnessing the preparation of the hosts which are to follow in their footsteps and meet the challenge  of a dying civilization with the truth and power and love of the Faith of Baha'u'llah and His program for the 

New World Order.           
                           
  Baha'i Summer Schools      
     Their Importance           
  CCHC (the Guardian, Shoghi 

 Effendi) hopes that through the earnest and sustained efforts of your committee these annual gatherings will acquire increasing importance in the eyes of the public, and will constitute an effective medium for the dissemination of the Teachings. He feels that in your next summer meetings continued  emphasis should be laid upon the teaching of the Administration, especially in its relation to the outside world, so as to impress the non — Baha'i attendants at the school with the nature, character and world significance of the World Order of Baha'u'llah."  (From a letter from the Guardian through his secretary to the 

Central States Summer      
School, dated November     
6, 1934.)                  

 No medium for teaching lies so near to the heart of the Guardian as these Summer Schools. He watches with infinite hope and trust the preparation of their work, the contents of their programs, the number of attendants, the growth and effect of their efforts. 

The National Assembly      

 urges the believers to realize the importance of these three Summer Schools, for these institutions are to evolve into educational centers which eventually will have profound public influence. 

 The following programs advanced for the season of 1935 will show the trend of the work in hand:

     Baha'i Archives            

  During this period the Archives Committee  was busy collecting, authenticating and translating the Tablets of tAbdu'1-BaM hitherto kept by their recipients, who cherished  them so dearly that they had not become conscious of the vital importance of preserving them in the National Archives, and who parted with them only after much earnest solicitation. Through the preservation of these Tablets, those bearing the signature of tAbdu'l-Bahd only, the authentic words of the Center of the Covenant of Baha'u'llah will be made available to all posterity and with the utmost vigilance the committee strove to secure, to list and to file them. Among the Tablets received was a group of twenty-five originals, with translations, from CAbd~1Bh~ to Miss Sarah Farmer. Other materials received included a small collection  of sacred relics which had belonged to Dr. Moody, and a collection of notes, correspondence, newspaper clippings and photographs which had belonged to 

Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehier   

 which form an excellent record of her work in various lands. 

  Editing of Tablets of rAbdu~l~Bahd Collaborating with the Archives Committee  those responsible for the editing of the unpublished Tablets of tAbd'lBh' were working diligently on the preparation of the contents for Vol. IV of the Tablets — sorting, classifying, separating and mak —  ing three copies of each Tablet of which there were up to that time three hundred and ninety-seven. 

 These will constitute Vol. IV and will be printed as soon as it is possible to bring them out in suitable form. In the meantime they have been filed alphabetically and returned to the Archives. 
                           
Other Committees           

  During this period the Committee for the preparation of material for the "Baha'i World," Vol. VI, were working steadily to bring this volume more nearly to the high standard which the Guardian constantly upholds. 
     The Committee for the      

Transcription of Braille   

 for the Blind made the objective of


<p116>
116             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  their year's work the production of the "Book of Iqan" and the hand-tooling of various of the shorter Baha'i writings for that remarkable Swedish publisher, Mr. Harald Thilander, through whose instrumentality it is hoped, some breeze from the Divine Rosegarden may reach the blind readers of many cities in Europe. 

 The CCBook of Iqan" as well as ~tBaM-u'lIAh  and the New Era" and certain pamphlets  are now in the circulating libraries for the blind which are connected with the public libraries in many of the large cities of this country. 

 The Contacts Committee, carried on primarily to arouse interest in the Baha'i Faith, have done yeoman service in tactfully  and consistently seeking to contact nationally known figures in the educational, sociological and literary fields, and the response with which they have been met is highly interesting. 

 In their report the committee says: The responses have shown how general is the search for the solution of the difficulties confronting humanity today. When it is pointed out that men such as Horace Bridges, Graham Taylor, 

Howard Vincent O'Brien     

 and others of the same stamp have eagerly responded, it is clearly apparent that Cthe world is waiting.' 

 " It is recorded that some six hundred and more persons have been individually approached. 

  rrThe Baha'i Magazine" CCThe Baha'i Magazine," so dear to the hearts of all who had watched its growth from year to year and had found it a means of inspiration, a faithful record of the early history of the Faith, and fund of information and a veritable mine of the jewels of the wisdom of Abdu'l-Baha, was approaching  the culmination of a long and useful career. 

 Evolving through the ttBah~'i News" which made its first appearance in 1909, through the "Star of the West" containing the record of that wonderful visit of tAbdu'1-BaM to this country, of His public addresses, His Tablets and instructions,  His prayers and exhortations, the early photographs as tie appeared on various occasions, the dedication of the Temple grounds, the trinian section and the news of the progress of the Faith in other lands, through these — and the subsequent change of title to the c(Bah?i 

 Magazine" — this intimate organ of the friends was about to merge itself into a vehicle to be known as "The World Order Magazine" which should appeal to the intelligentsia, to the world at large, to the minds and hearts of those true seekers of unity for whom the CCBh~~i Magazine" as such, might fail to have an appeal. 

 Never again will there be so precious, so glorious, so intimate a record of the beginnings of a Mighty Age! May its pages be preserved in imperishable glory! 

  History of the Cause 

   A National History Committee

 delegated to collect and preserve for posterity the early history of the Faith in America, together with all the circumstances relating to the visit of cAbdu~1~BaM, has been earnestly endeavoring to make an authentic record which only future generations will be able fully to appreciate, when with the growth of human perceptions mankind will have begun to understand its significance, will know this is a ccDay wherein the River of Life streamed forth from the finger of His Generosity and the Fountain of Revelation and Unity became manifest through His Manifestation, to all who are in His earth and heaven!" 
                           
         Indexing and   Cataloguing 

 the Baha'i Literature The difficulties encountered by this committee  were due to the fact that the work was new and the members entirely untutored in its technique. It is indeed the work of experts to undertake so important a commission but a survey of the believers in many centers revealed the fact that there were those who could undertake it and indeed  some work had already been done, so that a good beginning has been made and many valuable suggestions presented. 
                           
      Legal Matters              

  The Legal Committee concerned itself with the Indenture conveying the valuable


<p117>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES           117

  West Englewood property, upon which the National Baha'i headquarters are situated, as well as the parcel of land in the grove where tAbdu'1-BahA held His memorable Unity Feast in 1912, from Mr. 'Wilhelm to the Trustees for the 

National Spiritual Assembly. 

 The Indenture also conveying to the Trustees for the 

National Spiritual Assembly 

 the former home of the late Maria P. Wilson in Maiden, Mass., which tAbdu'1 —  Baha blest by living there for some time in 1912, and which had originally been bequeathed to the Guardian, was transferred by him to the trusteeship of the 

National Assembly.         

 The Indenture of the Bosch property in Geyersville, California, was at this time in its final stages and has since passed into the hands of the Trustees also. 

 Legal questions connected with the incorporation of several of the Local Spiritual Assemblies were under consideration, as well as certain ByLaw changes and interpretations. 

 A new form of bequests was in preparation  so that any legacy might appear in the proper legal form in the will of anyone desiring to bequeath property to the Cause. According to the Baha'i Law it is incumbent  upon every Baha'i to make a will and during this period bequests were left to the Cause by Mrs. Agnes S. Parsons, Mrs. Mary Harriman Rudd, Mine. Frida Stjerna and Dr. Susan I. Moody. 

 The symbol of the Greatest Name has been protected by law under trade mark registration made by the National Spiritual Assembly through the U. S. Patent Office, action having been taken to secure similar protection in Canada. The National Spiritual  Assembly has now limited the use of the symbol of the Greatest Name to books and pamphlets containing the Words of Baha'u'llah. The word ttBaM'i" was legally protected some years ago. 

 Deeds transferring several parcels of land in Haifa to the Palestine Branch of the National  Spiritual Assembly had been received from the Guardian, while several American believers have taken steps to transfer their holdings of Mt. Carmel land to the Palestine Branch of the National 

Spiritual Assembly.       
Distribution of Baha'i     
Literature to              

     Public Libraries           

  Every possible avenue of approach to the public has been employed, but through the means of the public libraries it is hoped to acquaint interested readers with the literature of the Faith and to this end Local Assemblies were urged to place the !cBah&i World," Vol. IV, before the public in this way so that they might have a consecutive record of Baha'i international progress. Local Assemblies were also requested to place copies of Dr. Cobb's (cSecurity for a Failing World" and ccTh Promise of All Ages" of Christophil in public and university libraries, the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. A complete catalogue of the Baha'i books now on the shelves of the public libraries throughout the country is in the hands of this committee. 
                           
        Publicity                  

  Well organized and efficient methods of publicizing the news of the Faith and familiarizing  the general public with the Teachings  and activities of the Baha'is have opened the doors of many of the most important  newspapers and magazines of the country, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar ever prom-ing  a most fertile and acceptable subject in every case. A complete file of all publicity is kept and a record of each teacher is available for any city where the travelling teachers may be visiting for the purpose of teaching the Faith. 
                           
        Publishing                 

  The brilliant work of the Publishing Committee is evidenced by the continual suppiy of new publications and the many valuable reprints which demand has made necessary. 

 The books are now handled through an eastern and a western agency as well as through the librarian at the Temple. This year witnessed as new publications —  "The Baha'i World, Vol. V

   Review and Editorial      

  The functions of this committee as de —  fined by the National Spiritual Assembly were: To determine whether the manuscript conformed to Baha'i teaching. 

  To determine whether the manuscript conformed to adequate standards of literary  style and taste. 

 To determine whether the manuscript met a real need in the Cause. 

  A further and most important step, in view of the possibility of a vast quantity of literature not fully conforming with the requirements which may appear in the future  was, that the National Assembly instructed the committee that the notation that the work is approved by the Baha'i Reviewing Committee is to be limited to such works as have not oniy been approved, and confirmed by the National Assembly, but which are also published under Baha'i auspices. 

  The Study Outline Committee

 compiled a most valuable study course of twenty lessons on Baha'i Administration which simplifies  and epitomizes many questions in Administration thus minimizing the labor of the sincere student. 
                          
        Race Amity                

 ccThe complexity of the racial situation in America," says Mr. Louis Gregory in his report to the National Spiritual Assembly at the Convention of 1935, £cmakes the work of building race amity one of delicacy and difficulty that challenges constant effort and the best resources of minds and hearts. The status of the colored race the country over, with marked varieties of degree, is that of an underprivileged and minority group, whose attainments of rights, which theoretically  belong to all Americans, and whose progress economically, socially, morally and spiritually is very largely dependent upon the attitude of their neighbors of the majority group." 

 CCThat the general awakening of the world has favorably affected this problem, that spiritual powers have play, that substantial progress has been made, nothing short of morbid pessimism can deny. The resources of government, education, philanthropy,  business and religion have unfolded plans in the effort to bind the breaches among peoples. 

 Yet with rare exceptions, even the most active and sincere, unless aided by the Divine Revelation of Today, are veiled by the shadows of past and present. 

 And even among the favored few tests are many and severe, making a constant demand  for faith, fidelity, intelligence, broadmindedness, courage, iove, patience, prayerfulness  and Guidance." 

 The committee and the cause of Amity met with a great ioss in the passing of that ardent advocate of this ideal, Mr. Hooper Harris, whose profound knowledge of the Teachings, especially in their relation to the Bible, made his services invaluable in this and every other field. 

 Amity meetings were held in many of the centers, and especially noteworthy was the Conference in Green Acre, while the publicity  accorded the work of the committee by articles which appeared in the tcChicago Defender," the ttPittsburgh Courier" and

  the "Amsterdam News," three great weekly journals of the colored race, were of immense  importance. 

 The report comments with appreciation on the devotion and service  of the Southern Baha'is in particular. 

  Mashriqu'l-Ad/olzdr The dominant note, the great undertaking  of this year was the continuation of the work of ornamentation on the dome of the Temple and every pulse quickened as progress  reports appeared from time to time and photographs of the details of the work were generously distributed among the friends. That this beautiful dome should have been able to grow and take form under existing financial conditions which have swept the country is one of the miracles of this age. To enumerate the various phases of the work would oniy be to recall some of the anxieties which beset those whose responsibility  it was to bring the matter to a successful  issue. It is more timely then to quote from the letter of the secretary of the Guardian which appeared at the end of the report of the chairman, Mr. Allen McDaniel. 

 The letter read: t~In closing may I convey to you and to the American Community of the believers as well, the Guardian's abiding appreciation and gratitude for the striking manner in which the American friends, under the leadership of your Assembly, have each and all arisen to meet the emergency which the lack of sufficient  funds had created in connection with the work of the Temple. 

 This constitutes indeed an added victory in the series of triumphs  which the American believers have, ever since the ascension of the Master, been winning in the fields of service to the Faith. Their collective, united and sustained labors in this connection are surely bound to hasten the realization of the Master'~ promises  concerning the ultimate triumph of the Cause throughout the American continent. May this sublime vision disclosed by tAb-du'1-BaM  intensify their zeal and stimulate their ardour in bringing their sacred and mighty task to a speedy consummation." 

  Services in the Tern pie The work of the exterior ornamentation of the Temple in no way interfered with the use of the Foundation Hall for meetings and a committee in charge of the programs worked diligently to sustain the interest in the public meetings which occurred as usual each Sunday at 3.30 P.M., and which were attended largely by new people. Every speaker is at his best when standing in this holy place to proclaim the Message of this Day of Cod, for the Temple is the heart of the Faith on the western hemisphere —  Sanctified be the Lord of all mankind, at the mention of Whose name all the atoms of the earth have been made to vibrate,  and the Tongue of Grandeur hath been moved to disclose that which had been wrapt in His knowledge and lay concealed within the treasury of His might. He, verily, through the potency of His name, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Most High, is the ruler of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth." 

 (Glean-ings  of Baha'u'llah, p. 16.) 

 Special meetings are frequently arranged as was the case during the sojourn of Mine. Gita Orlova whose brilliant teaching attracted many people. The Feasts and all Baha'i Holy Days are celebrated in the Temple, the Assemblies of Wilmette, 

Evanston  and Winnetka   

 and Chicago alternating in collaboration with the Temple program committee. 

 Besides this, hundreds of peo-pie  visit the Temple and are informed of its significance and of the Great Advent. 

 During  the year of 1934 approximately 12,000 visitors were conducted through the building;  of these some 1,130 represented the membership of many organizations such as clubs, etc. "Tear asunder in My Name, the veils that have grievously blinded your vision, and, through the power born of your belief in the unity of God, scatter the idols of vain imitation. 

 Enter then, the Holy Paradise of the good pleasure of the All-Merciful. Sanctify your souls from whatsoever is not of God, and taste ye the sweetness of rest within the pale of His vast and mighty Revelation, and beneath the shadow of His supreme and infallible authority. Suffer not yourselves to be wrapt in the dense veils of your selfish desires, inasmuch as I have perfected  in every one of you My creation, so that the excellence of My handiwork may

  be fully revealed unto men. It follows therefore, that every man hath been, and will continue to be, able of himself to appreciate the Beauty of God, the Glorified. Had he not been endowed with such a capacity, how could he be called to account for his failure? If in the day when all the peoples of the earth will be gathered together,  any man should, whilst standing in the presence of God, be asked: tWherefore hast thou disbelieved in My Beauty and turned away from My Self?' and if such a man should reply and say: ~Inasrnuch as all men have erred and none hath been found willing to turn his face to the Truth, I too, following their example, have grievously failed to recognize the Beauty of the Eternal,' such a plea will, assuredly, be rejected.  For the faith of no man can be conditioned by any one except himself. 

 ttThe signs of God shine as manifest and resplendent as the sun amidst the works of His creatures. 

 Whatsoever proceedeth from Him is apart and will always remain distinguished, from the inventions of men. From the Source of His knowledge countless Luminaries of learning and wisdom have arisen, and out of the Paradise of His Pen the breath of the All-Merciful hath continually  been wafted to the hearts and souls of men. Happy are they that have recognized this truth." (Gleanings of Baha'u'llah,  p. 143 et seq.) 
                           
        Conclusion                 

  ((Jo conclusion the important announcement  is made that the Guardian has given the friends a wonderful blessing in the form of new translations of excerpts from Tablets  of Baha'u'llah. 

 Within the last few days three different manuscripts have been received from Haifa, and with them a letter stating that these are to be published with the title "Gleanings from the Writings of B ah4'u'llAh." It would be presumptuous to attempt to describe their power, their beauty, their vitalizing spirit. Suffice it to remark that Shoghi Effendi, having renewed the Cause by instructing us in the principles of administrative order, now calls us to a spiritual renewal in our knowledge of the creative 

Utterance of Baha'u'llah." 

 APRIL 21, 1935 — APRIL 21, 1936. 

  The keynote of this epoch may best be sounded by reverting to a letter from the Guardian under date of January 10, 1936, which reads: "Dl beloved coworkers: ttThis new stage in the gradual unfoldment  of the Formative Period of our Faith into which we have just entered — the phase of concentrated teaching activity, synchronizes with a period of deepening gloom, of universal impotence, of ever-increasing destitution and widespread disillusionment in the fortunes of a declining age. This is truly providential and its significance and the opportunities it offers us should be fully apprehended and utilized. Now that the Administrative organs of a firmly established Faith are vigorously and harmoniously  functioning, and now that the Symbol (i.e. the House of Worship) of its invinci —  ble might is lending unprecedented impetus to its spread, an effort unexampled in its scope and sustained vitality is urgently required  so that the moving spirit of its Founder may permeate and transform the lives of the countless multitudes that hunger for its teachings. That the beloved friends in America, who have carried triumphantly  the banner of His Cause through the initial stages of its development, will in a still greater measure prove themselves capable of meeting the challenge of the present hour, I, for one, can never doubt. Of the evidences of their inexhaustibk vitality I am sufficiently and continually conscious. 

 My fervent plea will not, I feel certain, remain unanswered For them I shall continue to pray from all my heart. 

(Signed) SHOGrn"           

  crThe year that has come to a close, while marked by vigorous and varied activity, has been a period of spiritual incubation, of a turning inward to the life of the soui, such as has not occurred, perhaps, since the American Baha'is entered the valley of desolation at the loss of our Master, our inspiration, our guide, tAbd~1Bah~ teTwo conditions may be noted as chiefly responsible for this concentration of effort upon the establishment of a more conscious

CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES

  121 and vital inner life — the Guardian's gift of tGleanings from the Writings of Baha' —  u'lUh,' that inexhaustible draft of the Divine  Elixir, and the increased perturbations of a world whose cfoundations tremble and whose wise men are confounded.' 

 In reality we should regard these not as two conditions but as the two facets of the same providential destiny which both destroys and creates. 

 "As long ago as November 24, 1924, Shoghi Effendi wrote: 'We have but to turn our eyes to the world without to realize the fierceness and the magnitude of the forces of darkness that are struggling with the dawning light of the Abh4 Revelation. Nations, though exhausted and disillusioned, have seemingly begun to cherish anew the spirit of revenge, of domination, and strife. Peoples, convulsed by economic upheavals, are slowly drifting into two great opposing camps with all their menace of social chaos, class hatreds, and worldwide ruin. 

 Races, alienated more than ever before, are filled with mistrust, humiliation and fear, and seem to prepare themselves for a fresh and fateful encounter. Creeds and religions, caught in this whirlpool of conflict and passion,  appear to gaze with impotence and despair at this spectacle of unceasing turmoil.' 

 CCWhat the Guardian, with clear and unimpeded  view, could then so deeply discern, the nations themselves, for all the veils of spiritual darkness, interfering with and distorting  their vision, now begin to appreciate.  It is the note of conscious desperation sounding in society which this year has surrounded  us with an altered environment, one far more responsive to the ministration of the Divine Physician, yet one which likewise  makes supreme challenge to the community  of Baha'is. 

 ~tWhat wonder then that Shoghi Effendi has made teaching the very essence of our individual and collective Baha'i life; what wonder that he has made the translation of Baha'u'llah's Tablets so important a part of his myriad services; what wonder that the believers themselves, without relaxing their efforts in the performance of definite tasks, have felt intensely the need for renewing and confirming their relationship to the Manifestation of God upon which all capacity  and all effort depends. 

 "Therefore, as we summarize the history of this Baha'i year terminated by the Twenty-Eighth Annual Convention, let us not fail to bear in mind the fact that not by outward progress and achievement alone, but also by the establishment of purer motives, deeper humility and new powers of understanding, does the Baha'i community fulfil its privilege as the tnucieus and pattern' of the world order of Baha'u'llah ~h." "0 ye discerning ones of the people: "Verily, the Words of God which have descended from the heaven of the Will of God are the source of unity and harmony for the world. Close your eyes to racial differences and welcome all with the light of oneness. 

 Be the cause of the comfort and the advancement of humanity. 

 This handful of dust, the world, is one home, let it be in unity." 

 Steadily and earnestly the work of unifying the divergent races into the all-embrac-ing  consciousness of the Faith of Baha'u'llah has been moving forward. 

 The varying nationalities, so long victims of the error of separateness, won by the sincerity of the followers of Baha'u'llah, have come at last, or perhaps better, are coining at last to recognize that no ulterior motive, no unworthy  ambition lies at the root of the devotion to this Cause of those whose lives are dedicated to these holy ideals. 

 Public meetings throughout the country, well planned conferences, seasoned by the love of justice and understanding, are winning this hard contested territory. No longer is the emphasis placed on race amity, but on amity alone, the consciousness of racial differences having broken down in the ttlight of oneness." 
                           
    The Teaching Field         

 ccTh new hour has struck in the history of our beloved Cause, calling for nationwide systematic, sustained effort in the teaching field enabling thereby these forces to be directed into such channels as shall redound to the glory of our Faith and the honor of its institutions." 

 ttWith this clarion call of Shoghi Effendi to higher services in the teaching field, the


<p122>
122             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Guardian set in motion a new wave of concerted action by the American 

Baha'i Community.  How    

 miraculously the Will of God functions through the sincere servants may be realized by surveying the development  of community activities within the Faith, with the trends of conduct and the increasing problems of humanity without the 

Faith.                    

 ~tAfter the Ascension of tAbdu'1-Bahi, when the Faith was filled with great enthusiasm, but with the form under which its dynamic principles were to function undeveloped, the Guardian stressed the necessity  of perfecting the Administrative Order, the Form through which the Holy Spirit might descend unsullied and unstained during  the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah. 

 "The next call to community activity was the call to unified action in completing the superstructure of the Temple and the ornamentation of the dome — that cflarning beacon of hope to a distracted world.' Now with the Form of the Faith firmly established, with the symbol of its glory standing unique as a beacon to wandering humanity, we are called to arise as a unit in carrying to the human race the healing and quickening power of the Holy Spirit descending  into the world through the Faith of Baha'u'llah alone." 

 Throughout America it has become evident  that each and every follower of Baha'u'llah  is beginning to sense his individual responsibility and as this consciousness deepens the cry for teachers will be more adequately met and the spread of the new consciousness will gain more and more impetus.  The Guardian stresses the need of the pioneer spirit such as actuated the disciples of Jesus and of those who, in the early history of the Faith, forsook all worldly entanglements and followed in His footsteps. 

 A canvass of the present situation reveals the fact that there are ten states in the United States and three provinces in Canada where no believers exist. 

 In several of the states and provinces the Cause is represented by either isolated believers, or by small groups who have not reached the required proportions  to become a duly qualified Assembly. These conditions are being met with all the ardor and all the power possible and al though the staff of teachers operating under the direction of the National Teaching Committee is all too limited, still in the two year period covered by this survey the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies has increased from sixty to seventy-two with several more in a preparatory stage of development. 

 The preparation of individuals for an Assembly, besides the thorough grounding in the simple but explicit articles of Faith as expressed by the Guardian — the recognition of the BTh as the Heraki, Baha'u'llah as the Divine 

Messenger, Abdu'l-Baha   
as the Center  of the    

Covenant, the Guardianship

 irn —  posed by His Will and Testament on Shoghi Effendi, and the Administrative Order —  there are certain ordinances which a believer must understand and which are not only to be accepted as obligatory, but which are to be followed in conformity with the Laws contained in the CcMOt Holy Book," the Kitab-i-Aqdas," under which the Community of the Most Great Name will function  in the near future. The Ordinance of Fasting is one of these, and its explanation  as set forth by the Guardian is as follows: "AS regards fasting, it constitutes, together with the obligatory prayers, the two pillars that sustain the revealed Law of God. 

 They act as stimulants to the soul, strengthen, revive and purify it, and thus insure its steady development. 

 CCThe ordinance of fasting is, as is the case with these three prayers,~ a spiritual and vital obligation enjoined by Baha'u'llah upon every believer who has attained the age of fifteen. In the Aqdas He thus writes: CW have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity; this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. He has exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age, as a bounty from His Presence, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.' And in another passage He says: CWe have enjoined upon you fasting during a brief period, and at its close have designated for you Nawruz  as a feast. The traveler, the ailing, those who are with child or giving The three obligatory daily prayers, any one of which the believer is free to choose.

CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             123

  suck, are not bound by the fast. Abstain  from food and drink, from sunrise to sundown, and beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed in the Book.' 

 "Also in the tQuestions and Answers' that form an appendix to the Aqdas, Baha'u'llah  reveals the following: tVerily, I say that God has appointed a great station for fasting and prayer. But during good health its benefit is evident, and when one is ill, it is not permissible to fulfill them.' Concerning  the age of maturity, He reveals in the appendix of that same book: tThe age of maturity is in the fifteenth year; women and men are alike in this respect.' 

 c(Regarding the vital character and importance of the Divine ordinances and laws, and the necessity of complete obedience to them by the believers, we thus read in the Gleanings, p. 175: tKnow verily that the essence of justice and the source thereof are both embodied in the ordinance prescribed by Him Who is the Manifestation of the Self of God amongst men, if ye be of them that recognize this truth. 

 He doth verily Incarnate the highest, the infallible standard of justice unto all creation. Were His law to be such as to strike terror into the hearts of all that are in heaven and on earth, that law is naught but manifest justice. The fears and agitation which the revelation of this law provoke in men's hearts should indeed be likened to the cries of the suckling babe weaned from his mother's milk, if ye be of them that perceive "The fasting period, which lasts nineteen days starting as a rule from the second of March every year and ending on the twentieth of the same month, involves complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset. It is essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual recuperation,  during which the believer must strive to make the necessary readjustn-ients in his inner life, and to refresh and reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in his soul. Its significance and purpose are, therefore, fundamentally  spiritual in character. Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from selfish and carnal desires." — SHOGHI EFFENDI, through his secretary, Haifa, January  10, 1936. 

 The Annual Souvenir of eAbdu~1~Bahd Among the beloved and authentic traditions which will ever be treasured and celebrated by the Baha Community of Teaneck, New Jersey, assisted by all the adjacent Communities, is the Souvenir Feast of tAbdu'1-Bahi inaugurated by Him on the twenty-ninth of June, 1912. It is as if He had said: "This do ye in remembrance of Me," for in a Tablet to Mr. Roy Wilhelm tAbdu'1-BabA says: "Thy letter dated July 13, 1913, was received. 

 Its contents indicated the firmness and steadfastness of the believers of God and told of holding a divine meeting in your radiant, charming country place. 

 Praise be to God that the day was spent in the utmost joy and happiness. 

That Annual Memorial       

 Meeting will be the Souvenir of CAbdu~1~Bahi especially when it is passed with infinite delight and gladness." 

 And so from year to year this Feast marks one of the cherished events in which several hundred people participate. A beautifully arranged program with music and discourses by various friends proves indeed the source of joy and delight and proves also a successful method of advancing  the teachings. 

 During this year a notable increase is apparent in the number of attendants at the services, not oniy in the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar but in the various centers where meetings are held in public places particularly for the purpose of attracting new people. During the notable visit of RiXhi Effendi Afnin, that radiant expounder of the Faith, great numbers of people attended the meetings and many expressed the wish to become members of the study classes which are assiduously being carried on in every locality. 

 To meet the demand for information about the Faith a quantity of literature has been prepared and is distributed to all inquirers.  Among these pamphlets are those of Dr. Stanwood Cobb on ccHornocu1ture,~~ Miss 

Marion Holley's "Most      
Great Peace," the "Oneness 

 of Mankind" by Hussein Effendi  Rabkni and the ttPth to God" by Mrs. Dorothy Baker. A beautifully illustrated  pamphlet on the CcBhi~i House of Worship" with text by Dr. Genevieve Coy


<p124>
124             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  has attracted much comment and admiration  and is one of which the friends may be justly proud. 

  rrrerminatiois of First 

Stage of Formative Period  

 of Our Fall is" 'tExamining the year as a whole, the following events and trends seem to possess most decisive importance. 

 "First the publication of ~G1eanings From the 

NVritings of Baha'u'llah'; 

 second, the completion of the external decoration of the clerestory section of the dome unit; third, the formation of ten new Spiritual Assemblies, which took place near the end of last year but could not be recognized and reported to the friends until after the 1935 Convention; fourth, the intensification of teaching activities and the increased clarity and power with which the believers have promulgated the Message; fifth, the visit paid us by RAbi Effendi AfMn; and sixth, the National Meeting at the Baha'i I — louse of Worship on October 26 and 27 which commemorated the completion of another stage in Temple construction and inaugurated  the beginning of general conferences between the National Spiritual Assembly and the representatives of local Assemblies. 

 "On August 3, in response to a cablegram  announcing the completion of the clerestory section, the Guardian used these significant words: tGratefully rejoice cios-ing  glorious chapter marking termination first stage (of) Formative Period of our Faith. Appeal entire community henceforth concentrate its attention (and) resources (upon) activities (in the) teaching field, ensuring thereby (the) means essential for completion remaining units. Praying continually success.' 

 CtThus were we made conscious of the operation of the mysterious law of cycles, under which each successive period is given its lesson to learn, its task to perform, creating  thereby, like the succession of classes in a school, an enlargement of capacity for the harder tasks and the more important lessons to come. The opportunity offered does not return; only to the degree that we have been faithful in acquiring the qualities characteristic of the prior period, when the administrative structure was developed and the thoughts and actions concentrated upon Temple construction, can we rise to the full height of spiritual development and service vouchsafed to us in this era of teaching. The body of the Cause in America has been created. It is for us now to pray and strive that this body be filled with the light of true faith. 

 "The character of the present era was in fact disclosed clearly to us in the cablegram sent to the National Spiritual Assembly for the conference at the Temple in October: cTte forces which progressive revelation of this mighty symbol of our Faith is fast releasing  in (the) heart of a sorely tried continent  no one of this generation can correctly appraise. The new hour has struck in (the) history of our beloved Cause, calling  for nationwide, systematic, sustained effort in teaching field, enabling thereby these forces to be directed into such channels  as shall redound to the glory of our Faith and (the) honor of its institutions.' 

 "Such words are as the turning of a fresh page. 

 May we inscribe upon it the record of inner and outer achievement brought into the realm of possibility and therefore responsibility by the irresistible onward march of God's Cause! 

 cCTh ten new communities of believers who have established Spiritual Assemblies, adding their force to the development of the new world order, have surely received the prayers and good wishes of the friends as they assume their place in the Cause and take up the responsibilities which rest upon all who enter the realm of sacrifice and unity. In the letter of greeting sent them by the National Spiritual Assembly last May, they were reminded of these words written by Shoghi Effendi in 1923: 'Though your number be small and limited, yet by virtue of that Celestial Power bequeathed to every one of you by our departed Master, you are assured that ere long your small company shall expand and wield such power and influence as no earthly power can ever hope for or attain. 

 Who can doubt that He is ever watching from His Station on high over His scattered fold and is guiding and strengthening His faithful lovers who toil and labor for the fulfilment of His


<p125>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            125

  word and the realization of His purpose for mankind?' 

 "The root of all spiritual teaching lies hidden in the soil of the quickened soui, nourished by study and devotion voluntarily attained by the individual himself, and thus the success of any general teaching plan depends entirely upon the extent to which we ourselves, as individual believers, have made intense prior effort to become firmly rooted in the spiritual Kingdom. 

 Ba. h~i'i teaching is the fruit of faith and the measure of unity. 

 The Cause is perfect and the world of humanity is starved for lack of the bread of understanding and the wine of love. 

 Therefore may we not for one moment regard our existence in the Cause as a kind of static membership which, once attained, we hold passively for life, but rather as a dynamic opportunity that must be fulfilled by continuous advance from stage to stage without limit and without end. 

 "As we were told in tThe Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah': tTht the Cause associated with the name of Baha'u'llah feeds itself upon those hidden springs of celestial strength which no force of human personality, whatever its glamor, can replace;  that its reliance is solely upon that mystic Source with which no worldly advantage, be it wealth, fame, or learning, can compare; that it propagates itself by ways mysterious and utterly at variance with the standards accepted by the generality of mankind, will become increasingly apparent  as it forges ahead towards fresh conquests in its struggle for the spiritual regeneration of mankind.' On the other hand, this truth does not exclude unified effort nor well-conceived general plans; it does not confine teaching to the realm of personal mysticism; rather does it reveal the necessity of imbuing our plans, whatever they are from year to year, with spiritual reality and not relying upon formal and Collective measures alone. 

 ttlt was most fortunate and opportune that the American visit of Riihi Effendi Afn6n came at the time when we were beginning  to realize that the Guardian's words on teaching involved our rise to a higher level and not merely a duplication of former attitudes and methods. 

 While that visit, unhappily, could not extend west of Chicago,  nevertheless for many communities it brought inspiration and active, fruitful assistance.  His knowledge, his passionate desire to promote the teachings, his heroic endurance in carrying out the continuous schedule of meetings — all this contributed greatly to the advancement made by the Cause in America this year. 

 CCThe conference held in Temple Foundation Hall last October, which gave to so many believers an opportunity to consult on the important subjects provided by the agenda, will, it is hoped, be followed in the future by similar general Baha'i conferences held not only in Foundation Hall but also in other parts of the country. The recommendation has been recorded in the Minutes of the National Assembly for the considera —  don of the incoming Assembly, that it prepare  a schedule of its meetings throughout the year in advance, which schedule is to provide if possible for similar conferences with the friends on the Pacific Coast, on the Atlantic Coast, and perhaps also for those in the South. Included in the recommendation is the thought that these regional conferences should contain one or more large public meetings, like the Baha'i Congress held at each Annual Convention, so that the consultation of the friends and the coi-lective  responsibility for teaching may be more closely linked together by the National  Spiritual 

Assembly.                 

 cdt is interesting to note that this general plan revives and extends a policy put forward  by the Assembly some ten years ago, when effort was made to hold a public meeting at the conclusion of each Assembly meeting — an effort which the pressure of work compelled the Assembly to forego after a few months. We trust that the time has now come when the idea can be developed with added energy and made a distinct aspect of Baha'i activity." 

  The Decisive Events of the Year Ccoly time can determine the relative importance of matters affecting the Cause, but the following specific happenings all have more than merely temporary value.

 "The increased number of American believers serving the Cause in foreign lands, and the notable services they have been privileged to render. Early in the Baha'i year, Mrs. True and Mrs. Hoagg returned from Europe and Mr. II. R. 

Mathews and Mrs. Loulie

Thus the American Baha community, through such devoted adherents, continues to perform its high mission in the Baha world.

 t~The more vigorous and comprehensive plans carried out by Baha'i youth, under which groups throughout America and in many other countries held the first of a series of regional conftrences, extended their services into the field of public teaching, and, by the National Youth Committee, inaugurated a new and improved Youth bulletin.

  teaching pamphlets in the series planned by the Free Literature Committee, which when completed will provide brief but interesting statements on essential aspects of the Faith, at a price so low that eventually hundreds of thousands of copies may be distributed. 

 "The completion of the important task assumed by the Committee on Editing Tablets several years ago, of preparing the unpublished Tablets of tAbdu'1-Bahi in the National Archives for use in another voi-ume of Tablets. 

 ccTh preparation of the general letters written by the Guardian for publication in two volumes instead of the one volume issued originally in 1928. Under the new plan, the letters are to be divided into two series, one with the present title of tBah~'i Administration'; the other with the title cTh 

World Order of Baha'u'llah' 

 and containing  those letters on that subject received in more recent years. This general idea, it may be remarked, was approved by the Guardian in 1934, but the plan has been deferred until the supply of the books on hand was exhausted. 

 The next edition of tBahA'i Administration' will contain several early letters reported this year by the Archives Committee. The cWorld Order' vo'-ume  will contain the two ~Wor1d Order' letters, 

CThe Goal of a New 'World  
Order,' The Golden Age     

 of the Cause of Baha'u'llah,' ~Arnerica and the Most 

Great Peace,' ~The Dispensation

 of Baha'u'llah,' and the new letter already mentioned, on tThe Un-foidment of World Civilization.' 

 This latter  book, as all believers recognize, traces not merely for the present Baha'i community but also for humanity itself the golden thread of Divine destiny woven through the fabric of human life in this crucial period. 

 "The inclusion of an illustrated article on the Temple and the Teachings in the tArnerican Guide' series of volumes under preparation by writers in a Federal Department,  which will be duplicated in the voi-umes  covering the

 "The possibility that Spiritual Assemblies will be established this year in the new cities of Dayton, Ohio, Springfield, Mass., 
and Rockford, Ill.         

 Baha'i News, it should be remarked, has been the vehicle for so many general statements and reports that there has not been space for publishing a number of in —  teresting news items this year. 

 The thought might be advanced that possibly in future a distinction can be made between material intended primarily for local Spiritual Assemblies,  and material directed to all Baha'is. 

 The material intended for the Assemblies could be issued in the form of a monthly mimeographed bulletin, while the more general information could have priority in Baha'i News. Such a method would tend to develop Baha'i News along the lines indicated in the letter written by the Guardian on April 10, 1925." 
                           
   General Observations       

 CtA few general observations may be permitted,  in order to learn as much as possible from our collective experience during the time since the last Convention. 

 ttFirst of all, let us note that the Guardian's communications have in several instances  been directed to the individual believer, emphasizing values in the Baha'i life which oniy voluntary effort can create. For example, his appeal for concentrated effort on teaching goes to the very heart of individual faith and devotion, and cannot be fulfilled by administrative effort alone. His call for an abandonment of membership in nonBahA'i religious bodies is another appeal to the individual loyalty. 

 In his definition  of the National Fund as C bedrock on which all other institutions must necessarily rest and be established,' Shoghi Effendi clearly enlarges the sphere of the individual believer's responsibility. His letter on prayer and fasting, above all, strikes the note of personal spirituality which must distinguish our own heart's relationship to the Divine. 

 "Without this personal responsibility and continuous individual effort to advance in spiritual realms, administrative action would be fruitless and unavailing, a mere exercise of defined authority and power


<p128>

  without result. Oniy in a common consecration to Baha'u'llah can the inner as well as outer ties between communities and Assemblies become fulfilled in the unity for which the Manifestation suffered all the days of His life on earth. 

    "Regarding the National    

 Fund, we have the Guardian's expressed view that the demands  upon it can be fully met by enlarging constantly the number of confirmed Baha'is. 

 He does not advocate a retreat into smaller efforts and diminishing powers, but raises the golden banner heralding a determined and unflagging advance along the entire line. He has declared that none can estimate the reinforcement which the Baha'i community, and every active believer, will receive from on high when devotion becomes motion of the spirit to share a God-given truth. 

 !!Now we must continually seek to enlarge  our conception and purify our view of the universal meaning of Baha consultation,  the principle underlying all our activities and sustaining our collective life. Consultation has been ordained not to enable  any individual or group to bring pressure to bear upon others for the sake of attaining some predetermined aim. 

 Consultation  surely means that personal and group suggestions are advanced for the sake of contributing to the general community or Assembly discussion, and in a spirit severed from grief or dissatisfaction whatever the final decision may be. Furthermore, the law of consultation means that no matter how difficult the problem or tangled the situation which arises, all the believers concerned  with it will continue their mutual contact and maintain effort to solve it until the problem has actually been removed. Those who remain absent from Nineteen Day meetings and other general Baha'i gatherings lose the flow of life through the Baha'i body, and after a time must necessarily become unduly individualistic or reflect the influence of the non-Bahi'i environment. 

 The creation of unity brings sacrifice and suffering to every believer without exception. We can pay this price with gratitude and cheerfulness rather than reluctance if we realize that every experience of unhappiness or confusion we en — counter in the Cause represents nothing else than opportunity for further growth in the Kingdom. To withdraw from a situation because it challenges our ego is a turning away from the healing waters that well from the Source of life and love." 
eeTloe Unfoldment of World 

Civilization"              

  in conclusion, a few quotations from the Guardian's latest letter, addressed to all the friends. Its title, tThe Unfoldment of World Civilization,' suggests its marvelous scope as an analysis of the death of the old order and the birth of the new. 

 CTh contrast between the accumulating  evidences of steady consolidation that accompany the rise of the Administrative  Order of the Faith of God, and the forces of disintegration which batter at the fabric of a travailing society, is as clear as it is arresting. 

 Both within and without the Baha'i world the signs and tokens which, in a mysterious manner, are heralding  the birth of that World Order, the establishment of which must signalize the Golden Age of the Cause of God, are growing and multiplying day by day. 

 ~This New World Order, whose promise is enshrined in the Revelation of Baha'u'llah,  whose fundamental principles have been enunciated in the writings of the Center of His Covenant, involves no less than the complete unification of the entire human race. No machinery falling short of the standard inculcated by the Baha'i Revelation, and at variance with the sublime pattern ordained in His teachings, which the collective efforts of mankind may yet devise can ever hope to achieve anything  above or beyond that "Lesser Peace" to which the Author of our Faith has Himself  alluded in His writings. The Most Great Peace on the other hand, as conceived by Baha'u'llah — a peace that must inevitably follow as the practical consequence of the spiritualization of the world and the fusion of all its races, creeds, classes and nations — can rest on no other basis, and can be preserved through no other agency, except the divinely appointed ordinances  that are implicit in the World Order that stands associated with His holy name. 

 The Revelation of Baha'u'llah, whose

  supreme mission is none other but the achievement of this organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to its implications, be regarded as signalizing through its advent the coining of age of the entire lntrnan race. It should be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the ever-chang-ing  fortunes of mankind, not oniy as a further stage in a chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man collective life on this planet. The emergence of a world community, the consciousness  of world citizenship, the founding of a world civilization and culture — all of which must synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the Golden Age of the Baha era — should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the furthermost  limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an individual, will, nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation,  continue indefinitely to progress and develop.' 

 CC cFor the revelation of so great a favor a period of intense turmoil and widespread suffering would seem to be indispensable. Resplendent as has been the Age that has witnessed the inception of the Mission with which Baha'u'llah has been entrusted, the interval which must elapse ere that Age yields its choicest fruit must, it is becomingly  increasingly apparent, be overshadowed by such moral and social gloom as can alone prepare an unrepentant humanity for the prize she is destined to inherit. Deep as is the gloom that already encircles the world, the afflictive ordeals which that world is to suffer are still in preparation, nor can their blackness be as yet imagined. We stand on the threshold of an age whose convulsions proclaim alike the death-pangs of the old order and the birth-pangs of the new. 

 "Such is the tremendous vista revealed to us by the Guardian's power to open the door upon the movements of destiny! Nothing that is merely human nature can possibly sustain the shock of the collapse as the pillars of the false temple are thrown from their foundations by an Almighty power. Only the Cause of God can endure  — the Cause that moves forward by the sincerity of its believers and their whole-souled  unity in a Divine Faith." 
                          
        GENEVA SCANS THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
                  B~ HELEN BISHOP

     HE International Baha'i  

 Bureau in Geneva is a secretariat constituted to serve the eight hundred centers of the Baha'i World Community, and to be a bureau of information on the Cause. 

 The Bureau exercises no authority whatsoever; neither is it subject to the jurisdiction  of any local or National Assembly. Although our local teaching activity aims at the eventual formation of a Local Spiritual 

Assembly, the Bureau's    

 sphere is international and its function cannot be impaired. 

 The prerogative of the Bureau and its obligation to Assemblies is that same Law of Consultation, which Baha'u'llah has legislated to harmonize affairs, and to solve the human problems arising through the interaction of the individual and the group. 

 Not in any way is the Bureau staff to be confused with elected administrative bodies. 

 Its function is essentially an intermediary  one to such elected bodies, as well as to other centers and even individuals. Our Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, has summarized: c!Geneva is auxiliary to the Center in Haifa. 

 It does not assume the place of Haifa, but is auxiliary. It exercises no international authority; it does not try to impose, but helps and acts as intermediary between Haifa and other Baha'i centers. It is international because it links the different countries; it is like a distributing center." 

 (Baha'i World, Vol. IV, p. 261.) 

 A life-sketch of this Baha'i institution is available in the Babd'i World, Vol. IV. More recent happenings include the arrival


<p131>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            131

  of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bishop in April of 1934. 

 They came to work under the direction of Mrs. Emogene Hoagg, there to reinforce the efforts of Miss Lentz and Mrs. Lynch, two members of staff who had carried  the Bureau routine for years. The former is German by birth, the latter Russian; both are versed in languages. 

 In July of 1934, Mrs. Hoagg, under medical orders and with the permission of Shoghi Effendi, withdrew from the Bureau on extended leave of absence. This rest she has strenuously earned by years of pioneer work for the Cause in 

Italy and Geneva.          

 Foremost among the Bureau's champions is Miss Julia Culver, now in California. These many years Miss Culver has assumed the quiet task of financing a diminutive institution in Geneva, reputedly one of the high-priced capitals of the world. 

 The only other regular subscriber is Shoghi Effendi, who sends nine pounds sterling every month to keep us on the credit side of the ledger. 

 Inasmuch as the Baha'i traveler invariably  greets us, "After all, what goes on in the Bureau?", decorum allows that we make reply and state what the Bureau's mechanism of service entails. 

 (a)     A modest charity, sometimes material,  but habitually the patient interview and encouragement of that inevitable drift of wanderers and maladjusted personalities, who are drawn into any religious stronghold  that keeps an open door on a public Street. 

 (b)     Attendance at the public sessions of the League of Nations, and cooperation with international societies which are not committed to party politics. The Bureau is absolutely nonpartisan, and free from political entanglements actual or conversational. 

 (c)     The persistent effort to contact international workers, and all lesser personalities,  who can be led from the universal social Principles revealed by Baha'u'llah to the recognition of His divine Manifestation. 

 (d)     Translations of the Teachings and other required materials into Esperanto, Spanish, Italian, Russian, French, German, and English. Materials for the Bureau's own use are translated independently; but translations for publication are made in collaboration with Assemblies, more particularly of late with the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Germany and Austria. 

 (e)     The publication of a news Bulletin, heretofore occasional, in French, German, and English, to the number of five hundred copies. 

 (f)     A world correspondence in various languages including Esperanto, supplying information or dealing with matters pertaining  to the Baha'i Faith. This is more intimately directed to isolated 

Baha'is and Assemblies     

 of the continent, who are pressing  for a firmer grasp of the Principles supporting the Administrative Order of Baha'i Faith. 

 (g)     The distribution of free literature to callers, or in response to letters of request;  besides, the sale and distribution of all Baha'i books when ordered. The maintenance of a free reading and lending Library, opened daily for morning and afternoon hours, is a prime feature of the Bureau. Incidentally, the enlargement of our Library depends upon the continuous donations made by the Bureau's friends, and the Assemblies of the Orient and Occident. 

 (h)     The entertainment of visiting Baha'is or their acquaintances, who bring cards of introduction. The weekly tea and social hour, sometimes with music, is the most conspicuous of Bureau pleasures, —  and, more seriously, the prolific field of Bah&is-to-be:    for association is the cause of unity; and unity is the source of order in the world." (Baha'u'llah) (i)     The conduct of a weekly evening meeting for the public, wherein the Teachings are presented in accordance with a program, published and issued to individuals and societies. This direct Baha'i method is varied by an occasional guest speaker on some universal perspective of today's work. 

   Since the Ridvan Season    

 1934, which is the time limit fixed for the commencement of this survey, visitors and guest speakers, who have contributed to the meetings, include:  Professor Pitman Potter, instructor

 several leaders in the Esperanto Movement; Baha'is from inn. 

    However, Miss Julia Goldman

 has been the traveling Baha'i teacher most frequently associated with Mrs. Bishop in the conduct of this teaching work. 

 In April of 1934, later in September through March of 1935, in September of 1935, Miss Goldman was in Geneva cultivating the field of contacts. 

 The orbit of Miss Goldman's activity extends to Florence, Paris, Brussels, in collaboration with the Princess Aussenac-de-Broglie; England, Copenhagen, Stockholm,  and some of the Baha'i centers in Germany, in collaboration with Mrs. Jeanne Bolles. 

 The archetype of traveling teachers is Miss Martha L. Root. After the publica-don of the modern Greek version of Baha'u'llah and the New Era [Athens, May 19341, she passed through the Balkan cities to Vienna, where the Assembly arranged meetings for her. She and Miss Lydia Zamenhof presented the Baha'i Faith at the International Esperanto Congress held in Stockholm, August 4th to the 11th, 1934. 
In Oslo, Norway, Miss      

Root assisted Miss Johanna 

 Schubartli in the wide distribution of the latter's translation of Baha'u'llah and the New Era, published in April, 1935. Now she is translating the Kitdb-i-iqdn into 

Norwegian.                 

 Throughout this period publicity was activated in Denmark, Sweden and Norway by some leading newspapers, which reviewed the aims and Principles of the Cause. Among the fine interviews were those accorded to Mrs. Stuart French, who made excellent contacts during two seasons of the northern cruise. 

In Copenhagen, Miss Johanna

 Sorenson keeps alive the interest  stimulated by these traveling teachers. 

 His Majesty, King Haakon, granted Miss Root an audience at the Royal Palace in Oslo on May 9th, 1935. Previously, 

His Majesty, the King      

 of Denmark, had accepted Baha'i literature presented by Mrs. Louise Erickson. 

 She was granted an audience by Crown Prince Adolph of Sweden. Among celebrities, Dr. Sven Hedin, noted for explorations and Chinese archaeology, encountered another Baha'i and accepted literature. A Swedish composer,  Count Waclimeister, is an ardent friend to the Cause and attends meetings in Paris. That Baha'i soui, brave "Man of the Trees," Richard St. Barbe Baker, did good work in Scandinavia in January, 1935. 

 Activity is always propitious, but the arrival of Mrs. 

Louise Erickson in Scandinavia 

 in February, 1935, is particularly so. The Master designated her to lift the spade of broken earth in the name of Scandinavia, when He dedicated the Universal House of Worship at Wilmette, Illinois, in 1912. She and Miss Root are now teaching in Finland, where indications are promising because observers agree that its folk are characterized by a high seriousness and an Oriental strain of religious insight. 

 During the summer months of 1935, Miss Root was acclaimed in Iceland. 

 She wrote that a friend at Reykjavik, won by Mrs. Thomas Collins with a booklet, became  the open door through which all subsequent reception was offered: interviews,  lectures, radio broadcasting, publicity. 

 Thereby is a tale lively and gratifying,  recent data towards the precept that a Baha'i may not neglect to make mention of Me on My earth"; for only the tcEssayer of Entities" can determine af ore-time the seeker's perception or the individual's  share in this universal Cause. 
     Holland is waiting for     

Miss Root's visit. There   

 she will be equipped with the Dutch translations of Baha'u'llah and the Neu~ Era and the Hidden Words. The latter is the excellent work of Captain Leyden, his first translation of a Text from Baha'u'llah. Both publications are gifts made during this


<p133>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             133

  period by Mr. and Mrs. Max Greeven of Bremen, supplemented by a donation from Shoghi Effendi. 

 To proceed with this enumeration of outposts: in Brussels, Belgium, a first-rate teacher, Mrs. May Maxwell, is active with Miss Mary Maxwell. No doubt, they will rally a group and hold regular meetings, for such is their record elsewhere. 

 Esthonia has its family of Baha'is, first led to the Cause by the Nova Ta go. In Praha, Czechoslovakia, a Baha'i cooperates with Esperantists, and brings peace movements  sonic cognizance of the Baha'i Faith. In Budapest, there are those who cherish the remembrance of tAbdu'1-BahA's presence  there. Nor is Baha'u'llah left without a witness in Albania, for Mr. Ref o Chapary translates and teaches in Gjinokaster. Meanwhile, the Delegate from Albania to the League of Nations, M. Kurti, stands for the ennobling spiritual and humanitarian Principles represented by the Baha'i 

Movement.                 

 Other centers in the Balkans require oniy the presence of a moving Baha'i spirit to guide interest to the height of consecration. Mrs. Louise Gregory has been working in Belgrade courageously; and, at this writing, her return is immediate. 

 Before her departure at the end of April in 1935, new Baha'is were declared; and a study class of six Russian students was formed. 

 Madame Draga Ilk became a Baha'i when she translated Baha'u'llah and the New Era into Serbian. A manuscript translation  of Some Answered 

Questions into Croatian    

 was made at the Bureau in Geneva, and sent to Belgrade for circulation. 

 The outlook is more than hopeful: Mrs. Gregory finds the Jugoslavs to be the most responsive I have found in any of the countries of Europe." 

 At a still more concrete stage is the status quo in Bulgaria. Miss Marion Jack, knowing  only French and English, but endowed by the Master with a winning spirit and a patience that subdues oppositions, has succeeded in the formation of a Spiritual Assembly, the first in the Balkans, elected in Sofia in July, 1934 by a Community of thirty or more. 

 In that Community men of professions and able translators, former Theosophists, and an Esperanto leader, are working together with less talented folk. 

 Interesting meetings are arranged to draw from a sympathetic circle double the size of the Community. 

 Now, the Spiritual Assembly of Sofia is reaching out to further the teaching work in Varna, Dubnitza, Plovdiv, and Starazagora. 

 Miss Jack describes the Bulgarians as open-minded and of religious temperament. Poised midway between Occident and Orient, they are singularly free from insular,  cultural prejudices. This acceptance of the Prophetic Message recalls the genuine religious passion with which they received Cyril and Methodius, the Christian Apostles sent out from Constantinople. 

 In the ninth century, by the conversion of the sovereign, Kh~n Boris, the people embraced Orthodoxy; and Bulgaria became an independent Church. Iiinian religion has been known there before, but it was a sophisticate and decadent form of it with which Bulgaria grappled from the tenth through the twelfth centuries (i.e. Manichaeism, 

"The Bogomil Heresy").     

 Martyrdoms, too. The poetic temperament ever seeks the romance of religion. 

 Conflicts are the index of aliveness. 

 If, through the informing Principles of the Baha'i Administrative Order, and the discipline of membership in World Community, a profound, religious subjectivity be converted into Unity — then Bulgaria may find a sublime destiny in the Commonwealth  of the Nations. 

 In Italy, Baha'is are to be found in Rome and Florence. In Rapallo, at New Year 1935, the Baha'i Faith was introduced by two talks given at the villa of an American singer, Mrs. Ephra Townley. Brigadier General MacGeorge, who was in command of troops in lr~n during the World War, was glad to hear of a Cause which fostered understanding and unity between East and 'West. 

 Mr. Ezra Pound admires 'Abdu'l-Baha, —  and met Him in London. A compelling poet, Mr. Pound has abandoned poetry to cry out for 'tSocial Credit," and applaud Movements to spiritualize man's material life.


<p134>
134             THE BAHA'I WORLD

     At the International Esperanto

 Congress, which traveled through the Italian cities during the week of August 3, 

1935, Miss Lidja Zamenhof 
presented the Baha'i Teachings.

 In Genoa, there is published in Italian a brilliant monthly review, which gives a world perspective on cultural, social, and spiritual achievements. 

 Exchange of literature from the Bureau, and a somewhat detailed correspondence with its Editor, Professor Lorenzo Caboara, becomes an index of the depths of pure consciousness resident in Italy, and directed towards the emergence of a New World Order based upon justice — and for humanity. 

   In France, the Spiritual  

 Assembly of Paris holds the largest regular meetings, and these according to high standard. Brilliant intellectual feats are performed by the students from tr~n, who select one of the youth group to prepare and read a paper at their own monthly meeting, sometimes attended by as many as fifty guests. 

This Union of Baha'i Students

 in Europe holds a yearly conference in Paris. 

 At the Conference  at Christmas time, 1934, the program  developed a correlation between the Baha'i Cause and essential world-trends. 

 The activities of an Armenian Baha'i in Marseilles have yielded a group which meets regularly. In Lyon, a study group of seven has been brought together by the combined efforts of Madame Bond, Miss Lidja Zamen-hof,  and M. 

Ezzatollali KhAn Zabili   

 of Isf~h4n. From Toulouse and Nancy, where Baha'is from Ir~n are residents, we anticipate  further reports of teaching activity. 

 A tract entitled Le Bahd'isme — son his-toire  — sa portde inondiale, and the new edition  of L'essai sur le Bahd'isrne, revised and annotated by Madame Dreyfus-Barney, are up-to-date equipment for the teaching work in France, — and throughout Europe as French is still the secondary language. 

     The National Spiritual    

 Assembly of the Baha'is of the British Isles appointed a National Teaching Committee in the spring of 1935, under the chairmanship of Mr. F.     St. George Spendlove. 

 By assisting resident teachers, and extending the orbit of traveling teachers, this Committee plans to draw the groups of the provinces into closer cooperation with London. 

 To that end, a northern representative was selected from Manchester, one of the oldest and strongest centers, much visited by the late Dr. Essle-mont,  the Americans and the Persians. Its earliest Baha'i, Mr. E. T. Hall, completes this year his first quarter-century in teaching  the Cause. 
  Meanwhile, in London,     

Mrs. Basil Hall's Drama   

 of the Kingdom and the challenging Promise of All Ages have been published. The variety and charm of the meetings have increased during this two-year period; and the flow of visitors from other countries has been constant. 

 At last the Youth Group has been properly  organized for regular meetings of study or sociability. 

 It numbers twenty-five and counts some fine trinian students among its members. 

 In October of 1935, the new Center in London was opened. It is more artistic and offers spacious quarters for meetings. In that same month the Committee sent forth a teacher to all the groups and their friends, more particularly to deepen the understanding of the evolving Administrative Order. All in all, the hour is auspicious and marks the time in which to increase the followers of Baha'u'llah in the British 

Isles.                    

 In Germany, on the other hand, teaching on a grand scale is not feasible now. In October of 1934, the government gave permission for the Baha'is to hold meetings throughout Germany, but these gatherings are necessarily invitational to Baha'is and their friends. 

 In some cities a police commissioner  attends special meetings. 

 Exceptional successes were as follows: the Feast of Baha'u'llah commemorated in Stuttgart on November 12th, 1934, consisting  of poetry, music, and addresses offered to an audience of several hundred; the public session of the Convention at Ridvan, 1935; the conference held in Berlin at Whitsuntide, 1935, for representatives of the northern centers. 

 By far the most spectacular teaching project is the yearly Summer Week at Esslingen, near Stuttgart. Besides the orientation courses, and Baha'i Teachings, the Administration has been presented during  the seasons of 1934 and 1935. 

The


<p135>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES            135

  School draws visitors from IrAn, America and Europe; and it is, indeed, among the rememberable adventures of a Baha'i on the continent. 

 Today, the program of activity in Germany  is fourfold: 1) translations and publications; 2) the subjective deepening in the Faith and the Unity; 3) the centralization of authority in the National Spiritual Assembly and the direction of its strength to the Assemblies and groups; 4) declaring the Manifestation to those who will bear. 

 This last is, in the deepest sense, the imperative throughout the countries under review here. To us it seems that Europe's spiritual oppression is too far advanced to admit of conversion in the mass: if souls escape the disiTlal atmosphere of religious orthodoxy, they are too frequently trapped in the sterility of a bitter unfaith. 

 Prejudices  abound, subtle and amazingly compiex — prejudices of religion, class, nation, race, besides the refined prejudices of history, tradition, and culture. 

 Addresses to the public notwithstanding, teaching in Europe at this eleventh hour resolves ultimately into the penetration of being in quest of souis inwardly taught and prepared by God for His Manifestation: I     saw another angel ascending from the East, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice tHurt not the earth until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.'

Great Name

Others will follow in rapid successrnn to alter life and manners at the roots; and, through that radical transformation, there will finally emerge the World Order of Baha'u'llah.

                    BAHA'U'LLAH

  From erGleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" MAN is the supreme Talisman. 

 Lack of a proper education hath, however, deprived him of that which he doth inherently  possess. Through a word proceeding out of the mouth of God he was called into being; by one word more he was guided to recognize the Source of his education;  by yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded. 

 The Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures and enable mankind to benefit therefrom. 

 If any man were to meditate on that which the Scriptures, sent down from the heaven of God's holy Will, have revealed, he will readily recognize that their purpose is that all men shall be regarded as one soui, so that the seal bearing the words ttThe Kingdom shall be God's" may be stamped on every heart, and the light of Divine bounty, of grace, and mercy may envelop all mankind. The one true God, exalted be His glory, hath wished nothing for Himself. The allegiance of mankind profiteth Him not, neither doth its perversity harm Him. The Bird of the Realm of Utterance roiceth continually this call: rcAll things have I willed for thee, and thee, too, for thine own sake." If the learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the fragrance of fellowship and love every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty, and discover the secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure. 

 Were the earth to attain this station and be illumined with its light it could then be truly said of it: "Thou shalt see in it no hollows or rising hills." 

 136 The generations that have gone before you — whither are they fled? And those round whom in life circled the fairest and the loveliest of the land, where now are they? Profit by their example, 0 people, and be not of them that are gone astray. 

 Others ere long will lay hands on what ye possess, and enter into your habitations. Incline your ears to My words, and be not numbered among the foolish. 

 For every one of you his paramount duty is to choose for himself that on which no other may infringe and none usurp from him. Such a thing — and to this the Almighty is My witness — is the iove of God, could ye but perceive it. Build ye for yourselves such houses as the rain and floods can never destroy, which shall protect you from the changes and chances of this life. This is the instruction of Him Whom the world hath wronged and forsaken. 

  Consider the pettiness of men's minds. They ask for that which injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth them. They are, indeed, of those that are far astray. We find some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein. Such men are in the depths of ignorance. 

 Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can quench. 

 Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. 

 Know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal. That which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of the mischief

  maker. Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness. 

 Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for their protection. 

 This, verily, is the truth, the certain truth. We approve of liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in others. 
We, verily, are the All-Knowing.

 Say: True liberty consisteth in man's submission unto My commandments, little as ye know it. Were men to observe that which 'We have sent down unto them from the Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty, attain unto perfect liberty. Happy is the man that hath apprehended the Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from the Heaven of His Will, that pervadeth all created things. Say: The liberty that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto God, the Eternal Truth. Whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven. 

  All-praise to the unity of God, and all-honor to Him, the sovereign Lord, the incomparable and all-glorious Ruler of the universe, Who, out of inter nothingness, hath created the reality of all things, Who, from naught, bath brought into being the most refined and subtle elements of His creation, and Who, rescuing His creatures from the abasernents of remoteness and the perils of ultimate extinction, bath received them into the Kingdom of incorruptible glory. 

 Nothing short of His all-encom-passing  grace, His all-pervading mercy, could have possibly achieved it. How could it, otherwise, have been possible for sheer nothingness to have acquired by itself the worthiness and capacity to emerge from its state of nonexistence into the realm of being? 

 Having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein, He, through the direct operation of His unconstrained and sovereign Will, chose to confer upon man the unique distinction and capacity to know Him and to love Him — a capacity that must needs be regarded as the gen crating impulse and the primary purpose underlying the whole of creation Upon the inmost reality of each and every created thing He hath shed the light of one of His names, and made it a recipient of the glory of one of His attributes. Upon the reality of man, however, He hath focused the radiance of all His names and attributes, and made it a mirror of His own Self. Alone of all created things man hath been singled out for so great a favor, so enduring a bounty. 

 These energies with which the DayStar of Divine bounty and Source of heavenly guidance hath endowed the reality of man lie, however, latent within him, even as the flame is hidden within the candle and the rays of light are potentially present in the lamp. The radiance of these energies may be obscured by worldly desires even as the light of the sun can be concealed beneath the dust and dross which cover the mirror. Neither the candle nor the lamp can be lighted through their own unaided efforts, nor can it ever be possible for the mirror to free itself from its dross. 

 It is clear and evident that until a fire is kindled the lamp will never be ignited, and unless the dross is blotted out from the face of the mirror it can never represent the image of the sun nor reflect its light and glory. 

 And since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true God with His creation, and no resemblance whatever can exist between the transient and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute, He hath ordained that in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Unto this subtle, this mysterious  and ethereal Being I-fe hath assigned a twofold nature; the physical, pertaining to the world of matter, and the spiritual, which is born of the substance of God Himself. He bath, moreover, conferred upon Him a double station. 

 The first station, which is related to His innermost reality, representeth Him as One 'Whose voice is the voice of God Himself. To this testifieth the tradition: "Manifold and mysterious is My relationship with God" The second station is the human station, exemplified by the following verses:


<p138>
138             THE BAHA'I WORLD
     am but a man like you."    

 "Say, praise be to my Lord! Am I more than a man, an apostle?" These Essences of Detachment, these resplendent Realities are the channels of God's all-pervasive grace. 

 Led by the light of unfailing guidance, and invested with supreme sovereignty, they are commissioned to use the inspiration of their words, the effusions of their infallible grace and the sanctifying breeze of their revelation  for the cleansing of every longing heart and receptive spirit from the dross and dust of earthly cares and limitations. Then, and only then, will the Trust of God, latent in the reality of man, emerge as resplendent as the rising Orb of Divine Revelation from behind the veil of concealment,  and implant the ensign of its revealed glory upon the summit of men's hearts. 

 From the foregoing passages and allusions it hath been made indubitably clear that in the kingdoms of earth and heaven there must needs be manifested a 

Being, an Essence Who      

 shall act as a Manifestation and Vehicle for the transmission of the grace of the Divinity 

Itself, the Sovereign Lord 

 of all. Through the Teachings of this DayStar of Truth every man will advance and develop until he attaineth the station at which he can manifest all the potential forces with which his inmost true self hath been endowed. 

 It is for this very purpose that in every age and dispensation the Prophets of God and His chosen Ones have appeared amongst men, and have evinced such power as is born of God and such might as only the eternal can reveal. 

 Can one of sane mind ever seriously imagine that, in view of certain words the meaning of which he cannot comprehend, the portal of God's infinite guidance can ever be closed in the face of men? Can he ever conceive for these Divine Luminaries, these resplendent Lights either a beginning or an end? 

 What outpouring flood can compare with the stream of His all-embrac-ing grace, and what blessing can excel the evidences of so great and pervasive a mercy? There can be no doubt whatever that if for one moment the tide of His mercy and grace were to be withheld from the world, it would completely perish. For this reason, from the beginning that hath no beginning the portals of Divine mercy have been flung open to the face of all created things, and the clouds of Truth will continue to the end that bath no end to rain on the soil of human capacity, reality and personality their favors and bounties. 

 Such bath been God's method continued from everlasting to everlasting. 

 The Purpose of the one true God, exalted be His glory, in revealing Himself unto men is to lay bare those gems that lie hidden within the mine of their true and inmost selves. That the divers communions of the earth, and the manifold systems of religious belief, should never be allowed to foster the feelings of animosity among men is, in this Day, of the essence of the Faith of God and His 

Religion.                  

  Consider the past. How many, both high and iow, have, at all times, yearningly awaited the advent of the Manifestations of God in the sanctified persons of His chosen Ones. 

 How often have they expected His coming, how frequently have they prayed that the breeze of Divine mercy might blow, and the promised Beauty step forth from behind the veil of concealment, and be made manifest to all the world. And whensoever the portals of grace did open, and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon mankind, and the light of the Unseen did shine above the horizon of celestial might, they all denied Him, and turned away from His face — the face of God Himself.... 

 Reflect, what could have been the motive for such deeds? What could have prompted such behavior towards the Revealers of the beauty of the All-Glorious? 

 Whatever in days gone by hath been the cause of the denial and opposition of those people hail now led to the perversity of the people of this age. To maintain that the testimony of Providence was incomplete, that it hath therefore been the cause of the denial of the people, is but open blasphemy. How far from the grace of the All-Bountiful and from His loving providence and tender mercies it is to single out a soul from amongst all men for the guidance of His creatures, and, on one hand, to withhold from Him the full measure of His divine


<p139>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 139

  testimony, and, on the other, inflict severe retribution on His people for having turned away from His chosen One! Nay, the manifold bounties of the Lord of all beings have, at all times, through the 

Manifestations  of His    

 Divine Essence, encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein. Not for a moment hath His grace been withheld, nor have the showers of Pus lovingkindness ceased to rain upon mankind. Consequently, such behavior can be attributed  to naught save the petty-minded-ness of such souis as tread the valley of arrogance and pride, are lost in the wilds of remoteness, walk in the ways of their idle fancy, and follow the dictates of the leaders of their faith. Their chief concern is mere opposition; their sole desire is to ignore the truth. Unto every discerning observer it is evident and manifest that had these people in the days of each of the Manifestations of the Sun of Truth sancti —  fled their eyes, their ears, and their hearts from whatever they had seen, heard, and felt, they surely would not have been deprived  of beholding the beauty of God, nor strayed far from the habitations of glory. 

 But having weighed the testimony of God by the standard of their own knowledge, gleaned from the teachings of the leaders of their faith, and found it at variance with their limited understanding, they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts. 
                           
    Consider Moses! Armed      

 with the rod of edestial dominion, adorned with the white band of Divine knowledge, and proceeding from the P~r~n of the love of God, and wielding the serpent of power and everlasting  majesty, He shone forth from the Sinai of light upon the world. 

 He summoned  all the peoples and kindreds of the earth to the kingdom of eternity, and invited  them to partake of the fruit of the tree of faithfulness. Surely you are aware of the fierce opposition of Pharaoh ~nd his people, and of the stones of idle fancy which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed Tree. So much so that Pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted their utmost endeavor to extinguish with the waters of falsehood and denial the lire of that sacred Tree, oblivious of the truth that no earthly water can quench the flames of Divine wisdom, nor mortar blasts extinguish the lamp of everlasting dominion. Nay, rather, such water cannot but intensify  the burning of the flame, and such blasts cannot but ensure the preservation of the lamp, were ye to observe with the eye of discernment, and walk in the way of God's boiy will and pleasure. 

  And when the days of Moses were ended, and the light of Jesus, shining forth from the DaySpring of the Spirit, encompassed the world, all the people of Israel arose in protest against Him. They clamored that He Whose advent the Bible had foretold must needs promulgate and fulfil the laws of Moses whereas this youthful Nazarene, who Laid claim to the station of the divine Messiah, had annulled the law of divorce and of the sabbath day — the most weighty of all the laws of Moses. Moreover, what of the signs of the Manifestation yet to come? 

 These people of Israel are even unto the present day still expecting that Manifestation which the Bible hath foretold!  How many Manifestations of Holiness,  how many Revealers of the light everlasting, have appeared since the time of Moses, and yet Israel, wrapt in the densest veils of satanic fancy and false imaginings, is still expectant that the idol of her own handiwork will appear with such signs as she herself bath conceived! Thus bath God laid hold of them for their sins, hath extinguished in then-i the spirit of faith, and tormented them with the flames of the nethermost fire. 

 And th~5 for no other reason except that Israel refused to apprehend the meaning of such words as have been revealed in the Bible concerning the signs of the coming Revelation. As she never grasped their true significance, and, to outward seeming, such events never came to pass, she, therefore, remained deprived  of recognizing the beauty of Jesus and of beholding the Face of God. And they still await His coming! From time immemorial even unto this day, all the kindreds and peoples of the earth have clung to such fanciful and unseemly thoughts, and thus have deprived themselves of the

  clear waters streaming from the springs of purity and holiness. 

 To them that are endowed with understanding,  it is clear and manifest that, when the lire of the love of Jesus consumed the veils of Jewish limitations, and His ~I go and another will come, Who will teli you all that I have not told you, and will fulfil all that I have said." Both these sayings  have but one meaning, were ye to ponder upon the Manifestations of the Unity of God with Divine insight.

  authority was made apparent and partially enforced, He, the Revealer of the unseen Beauty, addressing one day His disciples, referred unto His passing, and, kindling in their hearts the fire of bereavement, said unto them: "I go away and come again unto you." And in another place He said: Qasr Mazra~ih, Every discerning observer will recognize that in the Dispensation of the Qur'an both the Book and the Cause of Jesus were confirmed. 

 As to the matter of names, Muhammad, Himself, declared: '~I am Jesus." He recognized the truth of the signs, prophecies, and words of Jesus, and


<p141>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 141

  testified that they were all of God. In this sense, neither the person of Jesus nor His writings hath differed from that of Muhammad and of His holy Book, inasmuch  as both have championed the Cause of God, tittered His praise, and revealed His commandments. Thus it is that Jesus, Himself, declared: ~ go zway and come again unto you." 

 Consider the sun. Were it to say now, "I am the sun of yesterday," it would speak the truth. 

 And should it, bearing the sequence of time in mind, claim to be other than that sun, it still would speak the truth. 

 In like manner, if it be said that all the days are but one and the same, it is correct and true. 

 And if it be said, with respect to their particular names and designations, that they differ, that again is true. For though they are the same, yet one doth recognize in each a separate designation, a specific attribute, a particular character. 

 Conceive accordingly the distinction,  variation, and unity characteristic of the various Manifestations of holiness, that thou mayest comprehend the allusions made by the Creator of all names and attributes to the mysteries of distinction and unity, and discover the answer to thy question as to why that everlasting Beauty should have, at sundry times, called Himself by different names and titles. 

  It is evident that changes brought about in every Dispensation constitute the dark clouds that intervene between the eye of man s understanding and the Divine Luminary  which shineth forth from the dayspring  of the Divine Essence. Consider how men for generations have been blindly imitating their fathers, and have been trained according to such ways and manners as have been laid down by the dictates of their Faith. 'Mere these men, therefore, to discover suddenly that a Man, Who hath been living in their midst, Who, with respect  to every human limitation, bath been their equal, had risen to abolish every established principle imposed by their Faith — principLes by which for centuries they have been disciplined, and every opposer and denier of which they have come to regard as infidel, profligate and wicked, —  they would of a certainly be veiled and hindered from acknowledging His truth. Such things are as "clouds" that veil the eyes of those whose inner being hath not tasted the Salsabil of detachment, nor drunk from the Kawthar of the knowledge of God. Such men, when acquainted with those circumstances, become so veiled that, without the least question, they pronounce the Manifestation of God as infidel, and sentence Him to death. You must have heard of such things taking place all down the ages, and are now observing them in these days. 

 It behooveth us, therefore, to make the utmost endeavor, that, by God's invisible assistance, these dark veils, these clouds of Heaven-sent trials, may not hinder us from beholding the beauty of His shining Countenance,  and that we may recognize Him only by His own Self. 

  The beginning of all things is the knowledge  of God, and the end of all things is strict observance of whatsoever hath been sent down from the empyrean of the Divine Will that pervadeth all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth.

Speak, and hold not thy peace. The daystar of blissfulness shineth above the horizon of Our name, the Blissful, inasmuch as the kingdom of the name of God hath been adorned with the ornament of the name of thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens. 

 Arise before the nations of the earth, and arm thyself with the power of this Most Great Name, and be not of those who tarry. 

 Metbinks that thou hast halted and movest not upon My Tablet. Could the brightness of the Divine Countenance have bewildered thee, or the idle talk of the froward filled thee with grief and paralyzed thy movement? Take heed lest anything deter thee from extolling the greatness of this Day — the Day whereon the Finger of maiesty and power bath opened the seal of

  the Wine of Reunion, and called all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. Preferrest thou to tarry when the breeze announcing the Day of God hath already breathed over thee, or art thou of them that are shut out as by a veil from Him? 

 No veil whatever have I allowed, 0 Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, to shut me from the recognition of the glories of Thy Day — the Day which is the lamp of guidance unto the whole world, and the sign of the Ancient of Days unto all tbem that dwell therein. My silence is by reason of the veils that have blinded Thy creatures' eyes to Thee, and my muteness  is because of the impediments that have hindered Thy people from recognizing Thy truth. 

 Thou knowest what is in me, but I know not what is in Thee. Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By Thy name that excelleth all other names! If Thy overruling and all-compelling behest should ever reach me, it would empower me to revive the souls of all men, through Thy most exalted Word, which I have heard uttered by Thy Tongue of power in Thy Kingdom of glory. It would enable me to announce the revelation of Thy effulgent  countenance wherethrough that which lay hidden from the eyes of men hath been manifested in Thy name, the Perspicuous, the sovereign Protector, the Self-Subsist-ing. 

 Canst thou discover any one but Me, 0 Pen, in this Day? What bath become of the creation and the manifestations thereof? What of the names and their kingdom? "Whither are gone all created things, whether seen or unseen? What of the hidden secrets of the universe and its revelations? 

 Lo, the entire creation hath passed away! Nothing remaineth except My Face, the Ever-Abiding, the Resplendent,  the All-Glorious. 

 This is the Day whereon naught can be seen except the splendors of the Ligbt that shineth from the face of Thy Lord, the Gracious, the Most Bountiful. Verily, We have caused every soul to expire by virtue of Our irresistible and all-subduing sovereignty.  We have, then, called into being a new creation, as a token of Our grace unto men. I am, verily, the All-Bountiful, the 

Ancient of Days.          

  Beware, 0 believers in the Unity of God, lest ye be tempted to make any distinction between any of the Manifestations of His Cause, or to discriminate against the signs that have accompanied and proclaimed their Revelation. 

 This indeed is the true meaning of Divine Unity, if ye be of them that apprehend and believe this truth. 

 Be ye assured, moreover, that the works and acts of each and every one of these Manifestations of God, nay whatever perraineth unto them, and whatsoever they may manifest  in the future, are all ordained by God, and are a reflection of His 

Will and Purpose.  Whoso 

 maketh the slightest possible difference between their persons, their words, their messages, their acts and manners,  hath indeed disbelieved in God, hath repudiated His signs, and betrayed the Cause of His Messengers. 

  Look not upon the creatures of God except  with the eye of kindliness and of mercy, for Our loving providence bath pervaded all created things, and Our grace encompassed the earth and the heavens. This is the Day whereon the true servants of God partake of the life-giving waters of reunion, the Day whereon those that are nigh unto Him are able to drink of the soft-flowing river of immortality, and they who believe in His unity the wine of His Presence, through their recognition of Him Who is the Highest and Last End of all, in Whom the Tongue of Majesty and Glory voiceth the call: ccThe Kingdom is Mine. I, Myself, am, of Mine own right, its Ruler." 

 Attract the hearts of men, through the call of Him the one alone 

Beloved. Say:             

 This is the Voice of God, if ye do but hearken. 

 This is the DaySpring of the Revelation of God, did ye but know it. This is the Dawning-Place of the Cause of God, were ye to recognize it. This is the Source of the commandment of God, did ye but judge it fairly. This is the manifest and hidden Secret; would that ye might perceive it. 0 peoples of the world! Cast away, in My name that transcendeth all

EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 143

  other names, the things ye possess, and immerse yourselves in this Ocean in whose depths lay hidden the pearls of wisdom and of utterance, an ocean that surgeth in My name, the All-Merciful. 

  Lauded and glorified art Thou, 0 Lord, my God! 

 How can I make mention of Thee, assured as I am that no tongue, however deep its wisdom, can befittingly magnify  Thy name, nor can the bird of the human heart, however great its longing, ever hope to ascend into the heaven of Thy majesty and knowledge. 

 If I describe Thee, 0 my God, as Him Who is the All-Perceiving, I find myself compelled to admit that they Who are the highest Embodiments of perception have been created by virtue of Thy behest. And if I extol Thee as Him Who is the All-Wise, I, likewise, am forced to recognize that the WellSprings of wisdom have themselves been generated through the operation of Thy Will. 

 And if I proclaim Thee as the Incomparable One, I soon discover that They Who are the inmost essence of oneness  have been sent down by Thee and are but the evidences of Thine handiwork. And if I acclaim Thee as the Knower of all things, I must confess that They Who are the Quintessence of knowledge are but the creation and instruments of Thy Purpose. 

 Exalted, immeasurably exalted, art Thou above the strivings of mortal man to unravel  Thy mystery, to describe Thy glory, or even to hint at the nature of Thine Essence. For whatever such strivings may accomplish, they never can hope to transcend the limitations imposed upon Thy creatures, inasmuch as these efforts are actuated by Thy decree, and are begotten of Thine invention. 

 The loftiest sentiments which the holiest of saints can express  in praise of Thee, and the deepest wisdom which the most learned of men can utter in their attempts to comprehend Thy nature, all revolve around that Center Which is wholly subjected to Thy sovereignty, Which adoreth Thy Beauty, and is propelled through the movement of Thy Pen. 

 Nay, forbid it, 0 my God, that I should have uttered such words as must of neces-sky  imply the existence of any direct relationship between the Pen of Thy Revelation and the essence of all created things. Far, far are They "Who are related to Thee above the conception of such relationship! 

 All comparisons and likenesses fail to do justice to the Tree of Thy Revelation, and every way is barred to the comprehension of the Manifestation of Thy Self and the DaySpring of Thy Beauty. 

 Ear, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can affirm of Thee, or attribute unto Thee, or the praise with which he can glorify 

Thee! Whatever duty Thou   

 hast prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the utmost Thy majesty and glory is but a token of 'Thy grace unto them, that they may be enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own inmost being, the station of the knowledge of their own selves. 

 No one else besides Thee hath, at any time, been able to fathom Thy mystery, or befittingly to extol 

Thy greatness. Unsearchable 

 and high above the praise of men wilt Thou remain for ever. There is none other God but Thee, the Inaccessible, the Omnipotent, the Omniscient, the Holy of Holies. 

  All-praise and glory be to God Who, through the power of His might, bath delivered  His creation from the nakedness of nonexistence, and clothed it with the mantle of life. From among all created things He hath singled out for His special favor the pure, the gemlike reality of man, and invested it with a unique capacity of knowing Him and of reflecting the greatness of His glory. This twofold distinction  conferred upon him hath cleansed away from his heart the rust of every vain desire, and made him worthy of the vesture with which his Creator hail designed to clothe him. It hath served to rescue his soul from the wretchedness of ignorance. 

 This robe with which the body and soui of man hath been adorned is the very foundation  of his wellbeing and development. 0, how blessed the day when, aided by the grace and might of the one true God, man will have freed himself from the bondage

  and corruption of the world and all that is therein and will have attained unto true and abiding rest beneath the shadow of the Tree of Knowledge! 

  Know thou that, according to what thy Lord the Lord of all men, hath decreed in His Book, the favors vouchsafed by Him unto mankind have been, and will ever remain,  limitless in their range. First and foremost among these favors, which the Almighty hath conferred upon man, is the gift of understanding. 

 His purpose in conferring such a gift is none other except to enable His creature to know and recognize the one true God — exalted be His glory. This gift giveth man the power to discern the truth in all things, leadeth him to that which is right, and helpeth him to discover the secrets of creation. Next in rank, is the power of vision, the chief instrument whereby his understanding can function. The sense of hearing, of the heart, and the like, are similarly to be reckoned among the gifts with which the human body is endowed. 

 Immeasurably exalted is the Almighty  Who bath created these powers, and revealed them in the body of man. 

  Thine eye is My trust, suffer not the dust of vain desires to becloud its luster. Thine ear is a sign of My bounty, let not the tumult of unseemly motives turn it away from My Word that encompasseth all creation. 

 Thine heart is My treasury, allow  not the treacherous hand of self to rob thee of the pearls which I have treasured therein. 

 Thine hand is a symbol of My lovingkindness, hinder it not from holding fast unto My guarded and hidden 

Tablets.                   

 Unasked, I have showered upon thee My grace. Unpetitioned, I have fulfilled thy wish. 

 In spite of thy undeserving, I have singled thee out for My richest, My incalculable favors. 0 My servants! Be as resigned and submissive as the earth, that from the soil of your being there may blossom the fragrant, the holy and multicolored  hyacinths of My knowledge. Be ablaze as the fire, that ye may burn away the veils of heedlessness and set aglow, through the quickening energies of the love of God, the chilled and wayward heart. 

 Be light and untrammelled as the breeze, that ye may obtain admittance into the precincts  of My court, My inviolable 

Sanctuary.                

  O My servants! Let not your vain hopes and idle fancies sap the foundations of your belief in the All-Glorious God, inasmuch as such imaginings have been wholly unprofitable unto men, and failed to direct their steps unto the straight Path. 

 Think ye, 0 My servants, that the Hand of My all-en-compassing, My overshadowing, and transcendent  sovereignty is chained up, that the flow of Mine ancient, My ceaseless, and all-pervasive  mercy is checked, or that the clouds of My sublime and unsurpassed f a-vors  have ceased to rain their gifts upon men? 

 Can ye imagine that the wondrous works that have proclaimed My divine and resistless power are withdrawn, or that the potency of My will and purpose hath been deterred from directing the destinies of mankind? If it not be so, wherefore, then, have ye striven to prevent the deathless Beauty of My sacred and gracious Countenance  from being unveiled to men's eyes? Why have ye struggled to hinder the Manifestation of the Almighty and All-Glorious Being from shedding the radiance of His Revelation upon the earth? Were ye to be fair in your judgment, ye would readily recognize how the realities of all created things are inebriated with the joy of this new and wondrous Revelation, how all the atoms of the earth have been illuminated through the brightness of its glory. 

 Vain and wretched is that which ye have imagined and still imagine! 

 Retrace your steps, 0 My servants, and incline your hearts to Him Who is the Source of your creation. Deliver yourselves from your evil and corrupt affections, and hasten to embrace the light of the undying Fire that gloweth on the Sinai of this mysterious  and transcendent Revelation. 

 Corrupt  not the holy, the all-embracing, and primal Word of God, and seek not to profane  its sanctity or to debase its exalted character. 

 0 heedless ones! Though the wonders of My mercy have encompassed all created things, both visible and invisible, and though the revelations of My grace


<p145>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 145

  and bounty have permeated every atom of the universe, yet the rod with which I can chastise the wicked is grievous, and the fierceness of Mine anger against them terrible.  'With ears that are sanctified from vainglory and worldly desires hearken unto the counsels which I, in My merciful kindness, have revealed unto you, and with your inner and outer eyes contemplate the evidences  of My marvelous 

Revelations.              
                          
  0     My servants! Deprive

 not yourselves of the unfading and resplendent Light that shineth within the Lamp of Divine glory. Let the flame of the love of God burn brightly within your radiant hearts. 

 Feed it with the oil of Divine guidance, and protect  it within the shelter of your constancy. Guard it within the globe of trust and detachment from all else but God, so that the evil whisperings of the ungodly may not extinguish its light. 0 My servants! 

 My holy, My divinely ordained Revelation may be likened unto an ocean in whose depths are concealed innumerable pearls of great price, of surpassing luster. 

 It is the duty of every seeker to bestir himself and strive to attain the shores of this ocean, so that he may, in proportion to the eagerness of his search and the efforts he hath exerted, partake  of such benefits as have been preordained  in God's irrevocable and hidden Tablets. 

 If no one be willing to direct his steps towards its shores, if every one should fail to arise and find Him, can such a failure  be said to have robbed this ocean of its power or to have lessened, to any degree, its treasures? How vain, how contemptible,  are the imaginations which your hearts have devised, and are still devising! 

 0 My servants! The one true God is My witness! This most great, this fathomless and surging  Ocean is near, astonishingly near, unto you. Behold it is closer to you than your life-vein! 

 Swift as the twinkling of an eye ye can, if ye but wish it, reach and partake  of this imperishable favor, this God-given grace, this incorruptible gift, this most potent and unspeakably glorious bounty. 

 o     My servants! Could ye apprehend with what wonders of My munificence and bounty I have willed to entrust your souis, ye would, of a truth, rid yourselves of attachment to all created things, and would gain a true knowledge of your own selves — a knowledge which is the same as the comprehension of Mine own Being. Ye would find yourselves independent of all else but Me, and would perceive, with your inner and outer eye, and as manifest as the revelation of My effulgent name, the seas of My loving kindness and bounty moving within you. Suffer not your idle fancies, your evil passions, your insincerity and blindness of heart to dim the luster, or stain the sanctity, of so lofty a station. Ye are even as the bird which soareth, with the full force of its mighty wings and with complete and joyous confidence, through the immensity of the heavens, until, impelled  to satisfy its hunger, it turneth longingly  to the water and clay of the earth below it, and, having been entrapped in the mesh of its desire, findeth itself impotent to resume its flight to the realms whence it came. Powerless to shake off the burden weighing on its sullied wings, that bird, hitherto an inmate of the heavens, is now forced to seek a dwelling-place upon the dust. Wherefore, 0 My servants, defile not your wings with the clay of waywardness and vain desires, and suffer them not to be stained with the dust of envy and hate, that ye may not be hindered from soaring in the heavens of My divine knowledge. 

 0     My servants! Through

 the might of God and His power, and out of the treasury of His knowledge and wisdom, I have brought forth and revealed unto you the pearls that lay concealed in the depths of His everlasting ocean. 

 I have summoned the Maids of Heaven to emerge from behind  the veil of concealment, and have clothed them with these words of Mine —  words of consummate power and wisdom. I have, moreover, with the hand of divine power, unsealed the choice wine of My Revelation,  and have wafted its holy, its hidden,  and musk-laden fragrance upon all created things. Who else but yourselves is to be blamed if ye choose to remain unendowed  with so great an outpouring of God's transcendent and all-encompassing grace, with so bright a revelation of His resplendent mercy?


<p146>
146             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  O     My servants! There shineth nothing else in Mine heart except the unfading light of the Morn of Divine guidance, and out of My mouth proceedeth naught but the essence of truth, which the Lord your God hath revealed. 

 Follow not, therefore, your earthly desires, and violate not the Covenant of God, nor break your pledge to Him. With firm determination, with the whole affection of your heart, and with the full force of your words, turn ye unto Him, and waik not in the ways of the foolish. The world is but a show, vain and empty, a mere nothing, bearing the semblance of reality. 

 Set not your affections upon it. Break not the bond that uniteth you with your Creator, and be not of those that have erred and strayed from His ways. Verily I say, the world is like the vapor in a desert, which the thirsty dreameth to be water and striveth after it with all his might, uncil when he cometh unto it, he findeth it to be mere illusion. It may, moreover, be likened unto the lifeless image of the beloved whom the lover hath sought and found, in the end, after long search and to his utmost regret, to be such as cannot "fatten nor appease his hunger." 

 o     My servants! Sorrow not if, in these days and on this earthly plane, things contrary  to your wishes have been ordained and manifested by God, for days of blissful joy, of heavenly delight, are assuredly in store for you. Worlds, holy and spiritually glorious, will be unveiled to your eyes. You are destined by Him, in this world and hereafter, to partake of their benefits, to share in their joys, and to obtain a portion of their sustaining grace. 

  Know thou assuredly that the essence of all the Prophets of God is one and the same. Their unity is absolute. God, the Creator saith: There is no distinction whatsoever among the Bearers of My Message. 

 They all have but one purpose; their secret is the same secret. To prefer one in honor to another,  to exalt certain ones above the rest, is in no wise to be permitted. 

 Every true Prophet hath regarded His Message as fundamentally  the same as the Revelation of every other Prophet gone before Him. If any man, therefore, should fail to compre hend this truth, and should consequently indulge in vain and unseemly language, no one whose sight is keen and whose understanding is enlightened would ever allow such idle talk to cause him to waver in his belief. 

 The measure of the revelation of the Prophets of God in this world, however, must differ. Each and every one of them hath been the Bearer of a distinct Message, and hath been commissioned to reveal Himself  through specific acts. It is for this reason that they appear to vary in their greatness. Their Revelation may be likened unto the light of the moon that sheddeth its radiance upon the earth. Though every time it appeareth, it revealeth a fresh measure  of its brightness, yet its inherent splendor can never diminish, nor can its light suffer extinction. 

 It is ckar and evident, therefore, that any apparent variation in the intensity of their light is not inherent in the light itself, but should rather be attributed to the varying receptivity of an everchanging world. Every 

Prophet Whom the Almighty  

 and Peerless Creator hath purposed to send to the peoples of the earth hath been entrusted with a Message, and charged to act in a manner, that would best meet the requirements of the age in which He appeared. God's Purpose in sending His Prophets unto men is twofold. The first is to liberate the children of men from the darkness of ignorance, and guide them to the light of true understanding. 

 The second is to ensure the peace and tranquillity of mankind, and provide all the means by which they can be established. 

 Little wonder, then, if the treatment prescribed by the physician in this day should not be found to be identical with that which he prescribed  before. 

 How could it be otherwise when the ills affecting the sufferer necess~ —  tate at every stage of his sickness a special remedy? 

 In like manner, every time the Prophets of God have illumined the world with the resplendent radiance of the DayStar  of Divine knowledge, they have invariably  summoned its people to embrace the light of God through such means as best befitted the exigencies of the age in which they appeared. 
They were thus able


<p147>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 147

  to scatter the darkness of ignorance, and to shed upon the world the glory of their own knowledge. 

 It is towards the inmost essence  of these Prophets, therefore, that the eye of every man of discernment must be directed, inasmuch as their one and only purpose hath always been to guide the erring,  and give peace to the afflicted. 

 These are not days of prosperity and triumph. The whole of mankind is in the grip of manifold ills. 

 Strive, therefore, to save its life through the wholesome medicine which the almighty hand of the unerring Physician hath prepared. 

  Justice is, in this day, bewailing its plight, and Equity groanech beneath the yoke of oppression. 

 The thick clouds of tyranny have darkened the face of the earth, and enveloped its peoples. Through the movement of Our Pen of glory We have, at the bidding of the omnipotent Ordainer,  breathed a new life into every human frame, and instilled into every word a fresh potency. All created things proclaim  the evidences of this worldwide regeneration. 

 This is the most great, the most joyful tidings imparted by the pen of this wronged One to mankind. 

 Wherefore, fear ye, 0 My well-beloved ones! 

 Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse generation is molded. 

 The mere act of your gathering together is enough to scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people. 

 Every man of insight will, in this day, readily admit that the counsels which the Pen of this wronged One hail revealed constitute the supreme animating power for the advancement of the world and the exaltation  of its peoples. 

 Arise, 0 people, and, by the power of God's might, resolve to gain the victory over your own selves, that haply the whole earth may be freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of its idle fancies — gods that have inflicted such loss upon, and are responsible for the misery of, their wretched worshipers. 

 These idols form the obstacle that impeded man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection. 

 ~Mc cherish the hope that the Hand of Divine power may lend its assistance stance to mankind, and deliver it from its state of grievous abasement. 

 in one of the Tablets these words have been revealed: 0 people of God! Do not busy yourselves in your own concerns; let your thoughts be fixed upon that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the hearts and sonis of men. This can best be achieved through pure and holy deeds, through a virtuous life and a goodly behavior. Valiant acts will ensure the triumph of this Cause, and a saintly character will reinforce its power. 

 Cleave unto righteousness, Q people of Baha! This, verily, is the commandment which this wronged One hail given unto you, and the first choice of His unrestrained Will for every one of you. 

 0 friends! It behoveth you to refresh and revive your souls through the gracious favors which in this Divine, this soul-stir-ring  Springtime are being showered upon you. 

 The DayStar of His great glory hath shed its radiance upon you, and the clouds of His limitless grace have overshadowed you. How high the reward of him that hath not deprived himself of so great a bounty, nor failed to recognize the beauty of his Best-Beloved in this, His new attire. Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait, ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led by the light of the name of the All-Seeing  God, make your escape from the darkness that surroundeth you. Let your vision be world-embracing, rather than confined to your own self. The Evil One is he that hindereth the rise and obstruct-eth the spiritual progress of the children of men. 

 It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold fast unto whatsoever will promote  the interests, and exalt the station, of all nations and just governments. Through each and every one of the verses which the Pen of the Most High hath revealed the doors of love and unity have been unlocked and flung open to the face of men. We have erewhile declared — and Our Word is the truth — : "Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship." 

 "Whatsoever bath led the children  of men to shun one another, and bath

  caused dissensions and divisions amongst them, hath, through the revelation of these words, been nullified and abolished. From the heaven of God's Will, and for the purpose  of ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men, hath been sent down that which is the most effective instrument for the education of the whole human race. 

 The highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever the peoples of old have either said or written  hath, through this most potent Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the All-Possessing, the 

Ever-Abiding  God. Of     

 old it hath been revealed: "Love of one's country is an element  of the Faith of God." The Tongue of Grandeur bath, however, in the day of His manifestation proclaimed: ttlt is not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his who loveth the world." 

 Through the power released by these exalted words He hath lent a fresh impulse, and set a new direction, to the birds of men's hearts, and hath obliterated every trace of restriction and limitation from God's holy Book. 

 0     people of Justice! Be as brilliant as the lighc, and as splendid as the lire that blazed in the Burning Bush. The brightness of the fire of your love will no doubt fuse and unify the contending peoples and kindreds of the earth, whilst the fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot but result in strife and ruin. We beseech God that He may shield His creatures from the evil designs of His enemies. 

 He verily Lab power over all things. 

  This is the Day in which God's most excellent favors have been poured out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into all created things. It is incumbent upon all the peoples  of the world to reconcile their differences, and, with perfect unity and peace, abide beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and lovingkindness. 

 It behoveth them to cleave to whatsoever will in this Day be conducive to the exaltation of their stations, and to the promotion of their best interests. Happy are those whom the all-glorious Pen was moved to remember, and blessed are those men whose names, by vir rue of Our inscrutable decree, We have preferred to conceal. 

 Beseech ye the one true God to grant that all men may be graciously assisted to fulfil that which is acceptable in Our sight. Soon will the presentday order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead. Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth, and is the Knower of things unseen. 

  0 ye the beloved of the one true God! Pass beyond the narrow retreats of your evil and corrupt desires, and advance into the vast immensity of the realm of God, and abide ye in the meads of sanctity and of detachment, that the fragrance of your deeds may lead the whole of mankind to the ocean of God's unfading glory. 

 Forbear ye from concerning yourselves with the affairs of this world and all that pertain-eth  unto it, or from meddling with the activities of those who are its outward leaders. 

 The one true God, exalted be His glory, hath bestowed the government of the earth upon the kings. 

 To none is given the right to act in any manner that would run counter to the considered views of them who are in authority. 

 That which He bath served for Himself are the cities of men hearts; and of these the loved ones of Him Who is the Sovereign Truth are, in this Day, as the keys. 

 Please God they may, one and all, be enabled to unlock, through the power of the Most Great Name, the gates of these cities. 

 This is what is meant by aiding the one true God — a theme to which the Pen of Him Who causeth the dawn to break hath referred in all His Books and Tablets. 

  As to those that have tasted of the fruit of man's earthly existence, which is the recognition of the one true God, exalted be His glory, their life hereafter is such as We are unable to describe. The knowledge thereof is with God, alone, the Lord of all worlds. 

  This is the Day whereon the Ocean of God's mercy hath been manifested unto men, the Day in which the DayStar of His lovingkindness hath shed its radiance upon


<p149>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 149

  them, the Day in which the clouds of His bountiful favor have overshadowed the whole of mankind. 

 Now is the time to cheer and refresh the downcast through the invigorating breeze of love and fellowship, and the living waters of friendliness and charity. 

 They who are the beloved of God, in whatever place they gather and whomsoever they may meet must evince, in their attitude towards God, and in the manner of their celebration of His praise and glory, such humility and submissiveness that every atom of the dust beneath their feet may attest the depth of their devotion. The conversation carried by these holy souis should be informed with such power that these same atoms of dust will be thrilled by its influence. 

 They should conduct themselves in such manner that the earth upon which they tread may never be allowed to address them such words as these; "I am to be preferred above you. 

 For witness, how patient I am in bearing the burden which the husbandman layeth upon me. I am the instrument that continually impart-eth unto all beings the blessings with which He Who is the Source of all grace hath entrusted  me. Notwithstanding the honor conferred upon me, and the unnumbered evidences of my wealth — a wealth that sup-plieth  the needs of all creation — behold the measure of my humility, witness with what absolute submissiveness I allow myself to be trodden beneath the feet of men Show forbearance and benevolence and love to one another. 

 Should any one among you be incapable of grasping a certain truth, or be striving to comprehend it, show forth, when conversing with him, a spirit of extreme kindliness and goodwill. Help him to see and recognize the truth, without esteeming yourself to be, in the least, superior to him, or to be possessed of greater endowments. 

 The whole duty of man in this Day is to attain that share of the flood of grace which God poureth forth for him. Let none, therefore, consider the largeness or smallness of the receptacle. The portion of some might lie in the palm of a man's hand, the portion of others might fill a cup, and of others even a gallon-measure. 

 Every eye, in this Day, should seek what will best promote the Cause of God. 

  Great indeed is this Day! 

 The allusions made to it in all the sacred Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. 

 The soul of every Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, bath thirsted for this wondrous  Day. 

 All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to attain it. No sooner, however, had the DayStar of His Revelation manifested itself in the heaven of God's Will, than all, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to guide, were found dumbfounded and heedless. 

 0 thou that hast remembered Me! The most grievous veil hath shut out the peoples  of the earth from His glory, and hindered them from hearkening to His Call. God grant that the Light of unity may envelop  the whole earth, and that the seal, ~tthe Kingdom is God's," may be stamped upon the brow of all its peoples. 

 Arise, 0 wayfarer in the path of the Love of God, and aid thou His Cause. 

Say:                      

 Barter not away this Youth, 0 people, for the vanities of this world or the delights of heaven. By the righteousness of the one true God! One hair of Him excelleth all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. 

 Beware, 0 men, lest ye be tempted to part with Him in exchange for the gold and silver ye possess. 

 Let His iove be a storehouse of treasure for your souls, on the Day when naught else but Him shall profit you, the Day when every pillar shall tremble, when the very skins of men shall creep, when all eyes shall stare up with terror.  Say: 0 people! rear ye God, and turn not away disdainfully from His Revelation. 

 Fall prostrate on your faces before God, and celebrate His praise in the daytime  and in the night-season. 

 Let thy soul glow with the flame of this undying Fire that burneth in the midmost heart of the world, in such wise that the waters of the universe shall be powerless to cool down its ardor. Make, then, mention of thy Lord, that haply the heedless among Our servants may be admonished through thy words, and the hearts of the righteous be gladdened.


<p150>
150             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Say: 0 men! This is a matchless Day. Matchless must, likewise, be the tongue that celebrateth the praise of the Desire of all nations, and matchless the deed that aspir-eth to be acceptable in His sight. The whole human race hath longed for this Day, that perchance it may fulfil that which well beseemeth its station, and is worthy of its destiny. 

 Blessed is the man whom the affairs  of the world have failed to deter from recognizing Him Who is the Lord of all things. 

 So blind hath become the human heart that neither the disruption of the city, nor the reduction of the mountain in dust, nor even the cleaving of the earth, can shake off its torpor. The allusions made in the Scriptures have been unfolded, and the signs recorded therein have been revealed, and the prophetic cry is continually being raised. And yet all, except such as God was pleased to guide, are bewildered in the drunkenness of their heedlessness! 

 0 SalmAn! The door of the knowledge of the Ancient Being bath ever been, and wiii continue for ever to be, closed in the face of men. No man's understanding shall ever gain access unto His holy court. As a token of His mercy, however, and as a proof of His lovingkindness, He hath manifested  unto men the DayStars of His divine guidance, the Symbols of His divine unity, and hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self. Whoso recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call, hath hearkened to the Voice of God, and whoso testi-fieth to the truth of their Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God Himself. Whoso turneth away from them, hath turned away from God, and whoso disbe-lieveth in them, hath disbelieved in God. Every one of them is the Way of God that connecteth this world with the realms above, and the Standard of His Truth unto every one in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. They are the 

Manifestations of God      

 amidst men, the evidences of His Truth, and the signs of His glory. 

  A drop of the billowing ocean of His endless mercy hath adorned all creation with the ornament of existence, and a breath wafted from His peerless Paradise hath invested all beings with the robe of His sanctity and glory. A sprinkling from the unfathomed deep of His sovereign and all-pervasive Will hath, out of utter nothingness,  called into being a creation which is infinite in its range and deathless in its duration. 

 The wonders of His bounty can never cease, and the stream of His merciful grace can never be arrested. 

 The process of His creation hath had no beginning, and can have no end. 

 In every age and cycle He hath, through the splendorous light, shed by the Manifestations of His wondrous Essence, recreated all things, so that whatsoever reflecteth in the heavens and on the earth the signs of His glory may not be deprived of the outpourings  of His mercy, nor despair of the showers of His favors. How all-encom-passing are the wonders of His boundless grace! Behold how they have pervaded the whole of creation. 

 Such is their virtue that not a single atom in the entire universe can be found which doth not declare the evidences of His might, which dab not glorify  His holy Name, or is not expressive of the effulgent light of His unity. So perfect and comprehensive is His creation that no mind nor heart, however keen or pure, can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant  of His creatures; much less fathom the mystery of Him Who is the DayStar of Truth, Who is the invisibk and unknowable  Essence. 

 The conceptions of the de-vourest  of mystics, the attainments of the most accomplished amongst men, the highest  praise which human tongue or pen can render are all the product of man's finite mind and are conditioned by its limitations. 

  Shake off, 0 heedless ones, the slumber of negligence, that ye may behold the radiance  which His glory hath spread through the world. How foolish are those who murmur against the premature birth of His light. 0 ye who are inly blind! Whether too soon or too late, the evidences of His effulgent glory are now actually manifest. It behoveth you to ascertain whether or not such a light hath appeared. It is neither within your power nor mine to set the time


<p151>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 151

  at which it should be made manifest. God's inscrutable Wisdom bath fixed its hour be.-forehand.  Be content, 0 people, with that which God bath desired for you and predestined unto you. 0 my ill-wishers! The DayStar of eternal Guidance beareth me witness: Had it been in my power, I would have, under no circumstances, consented to distinguish myself amongst men, for the Name I bear utterly disdaineth to associate itsdf with this generation whose tongues are sullied and whose hearts are false. And whenever I chose to hold my peace and be still, lo, the voice of the Holy Ghost, standing on my right hand, aroused me, and the Supreme Spirit appeared before my face, and Gabriel overshadowed me, and the Spirit of Glory stirred within my bosom, bidding me arise and break my silence. 

 If your hearing be purged and your ears be attentive, ye will assuredly perceive that every limb of my body, nay all the atoms of my being, proclaim and tear witness  to this call: CCGod besides Whom is none other God, and He, Whose beauty is now manifest, is the reflection of His glory unto all that are in heaven and on earth." 

  0     Kamil! The heights which through the most gracious favor of God, mortal man can attain in this Day are as yet unrevealed to his sight. The world of being hath never had, nor doth it yet possess the capacity for, such a revelation. The day, however, is fast approaching when the potentialities  of so great a favor will, by virtue of His behest, be manifested unto men. 

 Though the forces of the nations be arrayed against Him, though the kings of the earth be leagued to undermine His Cause, the power of His might shall stand unshaken. 

 He, verily, speaketh the truth, and summoneth all mankind to the way of Him who is the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. 

 All men have been created to carry f or-ward  an ever-advancing civilization. 

The Almighty beareth Me   

 witness: To act like the beasts of the field is unworthy of man. Those virtues that befit his dignity are forbearance, mercy, compassion and lovingkindness  towards all the peoples and kindreds eds of the earth. Say: 0 friends! Drink your fill from this crystal stream that flow-eth  through the heavenly grace of Him who is the Lord of Names. Let others partake of its waters in My name, that the leaders of men in every land may fully recognize  the purpose f or which the Eternal Truth hath been revealed, and the reason for which they themselves have been created. 

  The vitality of men's belief in God is dying out in every land; nothing short of His wholesome medicine can ever restore it. The corrosion of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human society; what else but the Elixir of 

His potent Revelation     

 can cleanse and revive it? Is it within human power, 0 Hakim, to effect in the constituent  elements of any of the minute and indivisible  particles of matter so complete a transformation as to transmute it into purest gold? Perplexing and difficult as this may appear, the still greater task of converting  satanic strength into heavenly power is one that We have been empowered  to accomplish. 

 The Force capable of such a transformation transcendeth the potency  of the Elixir itsdf. The Word of God, alone, can claim the distinction of being endowed with the capacity required for so great and far-reaching a change. 

  The Great Being saith: 0 ye children of men! 

 The fundamental purpose animating the Faith of 

God and His Religion      

 is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. Suffer it not to become a source of dissension and discord, of hate and enmity. This is the straight path, the fixed and immovable  foundation. 

 Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure. Our hope is that the world's religious leaders and the rulers thereof will undoubtedly arise for the reformation  of this age and the rehabilitation of its fortunes. Let them, after meditating on its needs, take counsel together and, through anxious and full deliberation, ad

152             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  minister to a diseased and sorely-afflicted world the remedy it requires. 

 It is incumbent  upon them who are in authority to exercise moderation in all things. 'Whatsoever passeth upon the limits of moderation  will cease to exert a beneficial influence.  Consider for instance such things as liberty, civilization and the like. However much men of understanding may favorably regard them, they will, if carried to excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon men. 

 Please God, the peoples of the world may be led, as the result of the high endeavors  exerted by their rulers and the wise and learned amongst men, to recognize their best interests. How long will humanity persist in its waywardness? How long will injustice continue? 

 How long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men? 

 How long will discord agitate the face of society? The winds of despair arc, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife that divideth and ailhicteth the human race is daily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned,  inasmuch as the prevailing order appeareth to be lamentably defective. 

 I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He may graciously awaken the peoples of the earth, may grant that the end of their conduct  may be profitable unto them, and aid them to accomplish that which beseemeth their station. 

  0     contending peoples and kindreds of the earth! 

 Set your faces towards unity, and let the radiance of its light shine upon you. Gather ye together and, for the sake of God, resolve to root out whatever is the source of contention amongst you. Then will the effulgence of the world's great Luminary envelop the whole earth, and its inhabitants become the citizens of one city, and the occupants of one and the same throne. This wronged One hath, ever since the early days of His life, cherished none other desire but this, and will continue to entertain no wish except this wish. 

 There can be no doubt whatever that the peoples of the world, of whatever race or religion, derive their inspiration from one heavenly source, and are the subjects of one God. The difference between the ordinances un der which they abide should be attributed to the varying requisites and exigencies of the age in which they were revealed. All of them, except a few which are the outcome  of human perversity, were ordained of God, and are a reflection of His Will and Purpose. 

 Arise and, armed with the power of faith, shatter to pieces the gods of your vain imaginings, the sowers of dissension amongst you. Cleave unto that which draweth you together and uniteth you. 

 This, verily, is the most exalted Word which the Mother Book hath sent down and revealed unto you. To this beareth witness the Tongue of Grandeur from His habitation of glory. 

  Behold the disturbances which, for many a long year, have afflicted the earth, and the perturbation that hath seized its peo-pies.  It hath either been ravaged by war, or tormented by sudden and unforeseen calamities. 

 Though the world is encompassed with misery and distress, yet no man hath paused to reflect what the cause or source of that may be. Whenever the True Counsellor uttered a word in admonishment, lo, they all denounced Him as a mover of mischief and rejected His claim. How bewildering, how confusing is such behavior! No two men can be found who may be said to be outwardly and inwardly united. The evidences of discord and malice  are apparent everywhere, though all were made for harmony and union. The Great Being saith: 0 well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. 

 We cherish the hope that the light of justice may shine upon the world and sanctify it from tyranny. 

 If the rulers  and kings of the earth, the symbols of the power of God, exalted be His glory, arise and resolve to dedicate themselves to whatever will promote the highest interests of the whole of ~humanity, the reign of justice will assuredly be established amongst the children of men, and the effulgence of its light will envelop the whole earth. The Great Being saith: The structure of world stability and order bath been reared upon, and will continue to be sustained by, the


<p153>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 153

  twin pillars of reward and punishment. In another passage He hath written: Take heed, 0 concourse of the rulers of the world! 

 There is no force on earth that can equal in its conquering power the force of justice and wisdom. Blessed is the king who marcheth with the ensign of wisdom  unfurled before him, and the battalions of justice massed in his rear. He verily is the ornament that adorneth the brow of peace and the countenance of security. There can be no doubt whatever that if the daystar of justice, which the clouds of tyranny have obscured, were to shed its light upon men, the face of the earth would be completely transformed. 

  0     ye the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel together,  and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind, and better-eth  the condition thereof, if ye be of them that scan heedfully. 

 Regard the world as the human body which, though at its creation  whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians  who gave full rein to their personal desires, and have erred grievously. 

 And if, at one time, through the care of an able physician, a member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before. Thus informeth you the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 

 We behold it, in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot  discern clearly their own best advan tage, much less recognize a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. 

 And whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been his own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness of this motive hail limited his power to heal or cure. 

 That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument  for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician. 

 This, verily, is the truth, and all else naught but error. 

  The purpose underlying the revelation of every heavenly Book, nay of every divinely revealed verse, is to endue all men with righteousness and understanding, so that peace and tranquillity may be firmly established amongst them. Whatsoever instilleth assurance into the hearts of men, whatsoever exalteth their station or promoteth their contentment, is acceptable in the sight of God. How lofty is the station which man, if he but chooseth to fulfil his high destiny, can attain! To what depths of degradation he can sink, depths which the meanest of creatures have never reached! Seize, 0 friends, the chance which this Day offereth you, and deprive not yourselves of the liberal effusion of His grace. I beseech God that He may graciously enable every one of you to adorn himself, in this blessed Day, with the ornament of pure and holy deeds. He, verily, doeth whatsoever He willeth.

                    UNDERSTANDING

  greatest gift to man is that of intellect, or understanding. 

 The understanding is the power by which man acquires his knowledge of the several kingdoms of creation, and of various stages of existence, as well as of much which is invisible. 

 Possessing this gift, he is, in himself, the sum of earlier creations — he is able to get into touch with those kingdoms; and by this gift, he can frequently, through his scientific knowledge, reach out with prophetic  vision. 

 Intellect is, in truth, the most precious gift bestowed upon man by the divine bounty. Man alone, among created beings, has this wonderful power. 

 All creation, preceding man, is bound by


<p154>
154             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the stern law of nature. 

 The great sun, the multitudes of stars, the oceans and seas, the mountains, the rivers, the trees, and all animals,  great or small — none are able to evade obedience to nature's law. 

 Man alone has freedom, and, by his understanding or intellect, has been able to gain control of and adapt some of those natural laws to his own needs. 

 By the power of his intellect he has discovered means by which he not oniy traverses great continents in express trains and crosses vast oceans in ships, but, like the fish, he travels under water in submarines, and, imitating the birds, he flies through the air in airships. 

 Man has succeeded in using electricity in several ways — for light, for motive power, for sending messages from one end of the earth to the other — and by electricity he can even hear a voice many miles away. 

 By this gift of understanding or intellect he has also been able to use the rays of the sun to picture people and things, and even to capture the form of distant heavenly bodies. 

 We perceive in what numerous ways man has been able to bend the powers of nature to his will. 

 How grievous it is to see how man has used his God-given gift to frame instru ments of war, for breaking the commandment  of God ccThou shalt not kill," and for defying Christ's injunction to ccLove one another." 

 God gave this power to man that it might be used for the advancement of civilization,  for the good of humanity, to increase  love and concord and peace. But man prefers to use this gift to destroy instead of to build, for injustice and oppression,  for hatred and discord and devastation, for the destruction of his fellow-creatures, whom Christ has commanded that he should love as himself! 

 I hope that you will use your understanding  to promote the unity and tranquillity of mankind, to give enlightenment and civilization  to the people, to produce love in all around you, and to bring about the Universal 

Peace.                     

 Study the sciences, acquire more and more knowledge. 

 Assuredly one may learn to the end of one's life! 

 Use your knowledge  always for the benefit of others; so may war cease from off the face of this beauti~u1 earth, and a glorious edifice of peace and concord be raised. Strive that your high ideals may be realized in the Kingdom of God on earth, as they will be in heaven.

EVOLUTION OF THE SOUL      

  GOD, in His bounty, has given us a foretaste here, has given us certain proofs of the difference that exists between body, soul and spirit. 

 We see that cold, heat, suffering, etc., only concern the body, they do not touch the spirit. 

 How often do we see a man poor, sick, miserably clad, and with no means of support,  yet spiritually strong. Whatever his body has to suffer, his spirit is free and well. Again, how often do we see a rich man, physically strong and healthy, but with a soui sick unto death. 

 It is quite apparent to the seeing mind that a man's spirit is something very different  to his physical body. 

 The spirit is changeless, indestructible. 

 The progress and development of the soui, the joy and sorrow of the soui, are independent  of the physical body. 

 If we are caused joy or pain by a friend, if a love prove true or false, it is the soul that is affected. If our dear ones are far from us — it is the soui that grieves, and the grief or trouble of the soui may react on the body. 

 Thus, when the spirit is fed with holy virtues, then is the body joyous; if the soul falls into sin, the body is in torment. 

 When we find truth, constancy, fidelity and love, we are happy; but if we meet with lying, faithlessness and deceit, we are miserable. 

 These are all things pertaining to the soui, and are not bodily ills. Thus, it is


<p155>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 155

  apparent that the soul, even as the body, has its own individuality. 

 But if the body undergoes a change, the spirit need not be touched. When you break a glass on which the sun shines, the glass is broken, but the sun still shines. 

 If a cage containing a bird is destroyed, the bird is unharmed. If a lamp is broken, the flame can still burn bright. 

 The same thing applies to the spirit of man. 

 Though death destroy his body, it has no power over his spirit — this is eternal, everlasting, both birthiess and deathless. 

 As to the soui of man after death, it remains in the degree of purity to which it has evolved during life in the physical body, and after it is free from the body it remains plunged in the ocean of God's mercy. 

 From the moment the soul leaves the body and arrives in the heavenly world, its evolution is spiritual, and that evolution is: The approaching unto God. 

 In the physical creation, evolution is from one degree of perfection to another. The mineral passes with its mineral perfections to the vegetable; the vegetable, with its perfection,  passes to the animal world, and so on to that of humanity. 

 This world is full of seeming contradictions; in each of these kingdoms (mineral, vegetable and animal) life exists in its degree; though, when compared  to the life in a man, the earth appears to be dead, yet she, too, lives and has a life of her own. In this world things live and die, and live again in other forms of life, but in the world of the spirit it is quite otherwise. 

 The soul does not evolve from degree to degree as a law — it only eyolves nearer to God, by the mercy and bounty of God. 

 Try with all your hearts to be willing channels for God's bounty. For I say unto you that He has chosen you to be His messengers  of love throughout the world, to be His bearers of spiritual gifts to man, to be the means of spreading unity and concord on the earth. 

 Thank God with all your hearts that such a privilege has been given unto you. 

 For a life devoted to praise is not too long in which to thank God for such a favor. 

 Lift up your hearts above the present and look with eyes of faith into the future! Today the seed is sown, the grain falls upon the earth, but behold the day will come when it shall rise a glorious tree and the branches thereof shall be laden with fruit. Rejoice and be glad that this day has dawned, try to realize its power, for it is indeed wonderful! God has crowned you with honor and in your hearts has He set a radiant star; verily the light thereof shall brighten the whole world.

                    IMMORTALITY

  ACCORDING to divine philosophy, there are two important and universal conditions in the world of material phenomena; one which concerns life, the other concerning death; one relative to existence, the other nonexistence; one manifest in composition, the other in decomposition. 

 Some define existence as the expression of reality or being, and nonexistence as non-being, imagining that death is annihilation. 

 This is a mistaken idea, for total annihilation is an impossibility. At most, composition is ever subject to decomposition or disintegration; that is to say, existence implies the group~ ing of material elements in a form or body, and nonexistence is simply the dc-compos-ing  of these groupings. This is the law of creation in its endless forms and infinite variety of expression. Certain elements have formed the composite creature man. 

 This composite association of the elements in the form of a human body is therefore subject to disintegration which we call death, but after disintegration the elements themselves persist unchanged. Therefore total annihilation  is an impossibility, and existence can never become nonexistence. This would be equivalent to saying that light can become darkness, which is manifestly untrue  and impossible. 

 As existence can never become nonexistence, there is no death for man; nay, rather, man is everlasting and everliving. The rational proof of this is that the atoms of the material elements are


<p156>
156             TI-IL BAHA'I WORLD

  transferable from one form of existence to another, from one degree and kingdom to another, lower or higher. 

 ror example, an atom of the soil or dust of earth may traverse  the kingdoms from mineral to man by successive incorporations into the bodies of the organisms of those kingdoms. At one time it enters into the formation of the mineral or rock; it is then absorbed by the vegetable kingdom and becomes a constituent of the body and fibre of a tree; again it is appropriated by the animal, and at a still later period is found in the body of man. Throughout these degrees of its traversing the kingdoms from one form of phenomenal  being to another, it retains its atomic existence and is never annihilated nor relegated  to nonexistence. 

 Nonexistence therefore is an expression applied to change of form, but this transformation  can never be rightly considered annihilation, for the elements of composition are ever present and existent as we have seen in the journey of the atom through successive kingdoms, unimpaired; hence there is no death; life is everlasting. 

 So to speak, when the atom entered into the composition  of the tree, it died to the mineral kingdom, and when consumed by the animal,  it died to the vegetable kingdom, and so on until its transference or transmutation into the kingdom of man; but throughout its traversing it was subject to transformation and not annihilation. 

 Death therefore is applicable to a change or transference from one degree or condition to another. In the mineral realm there was a spirit of existence;  in the world of plant life and organisms  it reappeared as the vegetative spirit; thence it attained the animal spirit and finally aspired to the human spirit. These are degrees and changes but not oh-literation; and this is a rational proof that man is everlasting, ever living. Therefore death is only a relative term implying change. For example, we will say that this light before me, having reappeared in another  incandescent lamp, has died in the one and lives in the other. 
This is not death in reality.

 The perfections of the mineral are translated into the vegetable and from thence into the animal, the virtue always attaining a plus or superlative degree in the upward change. In each kingdom we find the same virtues manifesting themselves more fully, proving that the reality has been transferred from a lower to a higher form and kingdom of being. 

 Therefore nonexistence is only relative and absolute nonexistence inconceivable. This rose in my hand will become disintegrated and its sym-n-ietry  destroyed, but the elements of its composition remain changeless; nothing affects  their elemental integrity. They cannot become nonexistent; they are simply transferred from one state to another. 

 Through his ignorance, man fears death; but the death he shrinks from is imaginary and absolutely unreal; it is only human imagination. 

 The bestowal and grace of God have quickened the realm of existence with life and being. For existence there is neither change nor transformation; existence is ever existence; it can never be translated into nonexistence. It is gradation; a degree be-iow  a higher degree is considered as nonexistence. 

 This dust beneath our feet, as compared with our being, is nonexistent. When the human body crumbles into dust we can say it has become nonexistent; therefore its dust in relation to living forms of human being is as nonexistent but in its own sphere it is existent, it has its mineral being. Therefore it is well proved that absolute  nonexistence is impossible; it is only relative. 

 The purpose is this; — that the everlasting bestowal of God vouchsafed to man is never subject to corruption. Inasmuch as He has endowed the phenomenal world with being, it is impossible for that world to become non-being, for it is the very genesis of God; it is in the realm of origination; it is a creational and not a subjective world, and the bounty descending upon it is continuous  and permanent. Therefore man the highest creature of the phenomenal world is endowed with that continuous bounty bestowed  by divine generosity without cessation. 

 For instance, the rays of the sun are continuous, the beat of the sun emanates from it without cessation; no discontinuance  of it is conceivable. Even so the bestowal of God is descending upon the world of humanity, never ceasing, con


<p157>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 157

  tinuous, forever. If we say that the bestowal of existence ceases or falters it is equivalent to saying that the sun can exist with cessation of its effulgence. Is this possible?  Therefore the effulgences of existence are ever-present and continuous. 

 The conception of annihilation is a factor in human degradation, a cause of human debasement and lowliness, a source of human fear and abjection. 

 It has been conducive to the dispersion and weakening of human thought whereas the realization of existence and continuity has upraised man to sublimity of ideals, established the foundations  of human progress and stimulated the development of heavenly virtues; therefore  it behooves man to abandon thoughts of nonexistence and death which are absolutely imaginary and see himself ever living, everlasting in the divine purpose of his creation. He must turn away from ideas which degrade the human soul, so that day by day and hour by hour he may advance upward and higher to spiritual perception of the continuity of the human reality. 

 If he dwells upon the thought of non-exist-ence he will become utterly incompetent; with weakened willpower his ambition for progress will be lessened and the acquisition of human virtues will cease. 

 Therefore you must thank God that He has bestowed upon you the blessing of life and existence in the human kingdom. Strive diligently to acquire virtues befitting your degree and station. Be as lights of the world which cannot be hid and which have no setting in horizons of darkness. 

 Ascend to the zenith of an existence which is never beclouded by the fears and forebodings of nonexistence. When man is not endowed with inner perception he is not informed of these important mysteries. 

 The retina of outer vision though sensitive and delicate may nevertheless be a hindrance to the inner eye which alone can perceive. 

 The bestowaL of God which are manifest in all phenomenal life are sometimes hidden by intervening veils of mental and mortal vision which render man spiritually blind and incapable but when those scales are removed  and the veils rent asunder, then the great signs of God will become visible and he will witness the eternal light filling the world. The bestowals of God are always manifest. 

 The promises of heaven are ever present. The favors of God are all-sur-rounding but should the conscious eye of the soul of man remain veiled and darkened he will be led to deny these universal signs and remain deprived of these manifestations of divine bounty. Therefore we must endeavor  with heart and soul in order that the veil covering the eye of inner vision may be removed, that we may behold the manifestations of the signs of God, discern His mysterious graces, and realize that material blessings as compared with spiritual bounties  are as nothing. 

 The spiritual blessings of God are greatest. When we were in the mineral kingdom, although endowed with certain gifts and powers, they were not to be compared with the blessings of the human kingdom. In the matrix of the mother we were the recipients of endowments and blessings of God, yet these were as nothing compared to the powers and graces bestowed upon us after birth into this human world. Likewise if we are born from the matrix of this physical and phenomenal environment into the freedom and loftiness of the life and vision spiritual,  we shall consider this mortal existence and its blessings as worthless by comparison. 

 In the spiritual world, the divine bestowals are infinite, for in that realm there is neither separation nor disintegration which characterize the world of material existence. 

 Spiritual existence is absolute immortality, completeness and unchangeable being. Therefore we must thank God that He has created for us both material blessings and spiritual bestowals. 

 He has given us material gifts and spiritual graces, outer sight to view the lights of the sun and inner vision by which we may perceive the glory of God. He has designed the outer ear to enjoy the melodies of sound and the inner hearing wherewith we may hear the voice of our Creator. We must strive with energies of heart, soul and mind to develop and manifest the perfections and virtues latent within the realities of the phenomenal world, for the human reality may be compared to a seed. If we sow the seed, a mighty tree appears from it. The


<p158>

  virtues of the seed are revealed in the tree; it puts forth branches, leaves, blossoms, and produces fruits. All these virtues were hidden and potential in the seed. Through the blessing and bounty of cultivation these virtues became apparent. Similarly the merciful God our Creator has deposited within human realities certain virtues latent and potential. Through education and cuP ture, these virtues deposited by the loving God will become apparent in the human reality even as the unfoldment of the tree from within the germinating seed.

                  THE DIVINE SPIRIT

  HE greatest power in the realm and range of human existence is spirit — the divine breath which animates and pervades all things. 

 It is manifested throughout creation in different degrees or kingdoms. In the vegetable kingdom it is the spirit augmentative or power of growth, the animus of life and development in plants, trees and organisms of the floral world. 

 In this degree of its manifestation, spirit is unconscious  of the powers which qualify the kingdom of the animal. 

 The distinctive virtue or pius of the animal is sense perception; it sees, hears, smells, tastes and feels but is incapable in turn, of conscious idea-non  or reflection which characterize and differentiate the human kingdom. The animal neither exercises nor apprehends this distinctive human power and gift. 

 From the visible it cannot draw conclusions regarding the invisible whereas the human mind from visible and known premises attains knowledge of the unknown and invisible.  For instance, 

Christopher Columbus      

 from information based upon known and provable facts drew conclusions which led him unerringly across the vast ocean to the unknown continent of America. Such power of accomplishment is beyond the range of animal intelligence. Therefore this power is a distinctive attribute of the human spirit and kingdom. The animal spirit cannot penetrate and discover the mysteries of things. It is a captive of the senses. No amount of teaching, for instance, would enable it to grasp the fact that the sun is stationary and the earth moves around it. Likewise the human spirit has its limitations. 

 It cannot comprehend the phenomena of the kingdom transcending the human station, for it is a captive of powers and life forces which have their operation upon its own plane of existence and it cannot go beyond that boundary. 

 There is however another spirit which may be termed the divine, to which Jesus Christ refers when he declares that man must be born of its quickening and baptized  with its living fire. Souls deprived of that spirit are accounted as dead, though they are possessed of the human spirit. His Holiness Jesus Christ has pronounced them dead inasmuch as they have no portion of the divine spirit. 

 He says rcLet the dead bury their dead." in another instance he declares, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit." 

 By this he means that sonis though alive in the human kingdom are nevertheless dead if devoid of this particular spirit of divine quickening. They have not partaken of the divine life of the higher kingdom; for the sour which partakes of the power of the divine spirit is verily living. 

 This quickening spirit has spontaneous emanation from the Sun of Truth, from the reality of divinity and is not a revelation or a manifestation. It is like the rays of the sun. The rays are emanations from the sun. This does not mean that the sun has become divisible; that a part of the sun has come out into space. 

 This plant beside me has risen from the seed; therefore it is a manifestation and unfoldment of the seed. The seed, as you can see, has unfolded in manifestation and the result is this plant. Every leaf of the plant is a part of the seed. But the reality of divinity is indivisible and each individual of human kind cannot be a part of it as is often claimed. 

 Nay, rather, the individual realities of mankind when spiritually born are emanations from the reality of divinity, lust as the flame, heat


<p159>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 159

  and light of the sun are the effulgence of the sun and not a part of the sun itself. Therefore a spirit has emanated from the reality of divinity, and its effulgences have become visible in human entities or realities. This ray and this heat are permanent. There is no cessation in the effulgence. As long as the sun exists the heat and light will exist, and inasmuch as eternality is a property  of divinity, this emanation is everlasting. 

 There is no cessation in its outpouring. The more the world of humanity develops, the more the effulgences or emanations of divinity will become revealed, just as the stone when it becomes polished and pure as a mirror will reflect in fuller degree the glory and splendor of the sun. The mission of the prophets, the revelation  of the Hoiy Books, the manifestation of the heavenly teachers and the purpose of divine philosophy all center in the training of the human realities so that they may become  clear and pure as mirrors and reflect the light and love of the Sun of Reality. Therefore I hope that whether you be in the east or the west you will strive with heart and soul in order that day by day the world of humanity may become glorified, more spiritual, more sanctified; and that the splendor of the Sun of Reality may be revealed  fully in human hearts as in a mirror. This is worthy of the world of mankind. This is the true evolution and progress of humanity. 

 This is the supreme bestowal. Otherwise, by simple development along material lines man is not perfected. At most, the physical aspect of man, his natural  or material conditions may become stabilized and improved but he will remain deprived of the spiritual or divine bestowal. He is then like a body without a spirit, a lamp without the light, an eye without the power of vision, an ear that hears no sound, a mind incapable of perceiving, an intellect minus the power of reason. 

 Man has two powers, and his development  two aspects. 

 One power is connected with the material world and by it he is capable of material advancement. 

 The other power is spiritual and through its development his inner, potential nature is awakened. These powers are like two wings. 

 Both must be developed, for flight is impossible with one wing. Praise be to God! material advancement has been evident  in the world but there is need of spiritual advancement in like proportion. We must strive unceasingly and without rest to accomplish the development of the spiritual nature in man, and endeavor with tireless energy to advance humanity toward the nobility of its true and intended station. For the body of man is accidental; it is of no importance. 

 The time of its disintegration will inevitably come. 

 But the spirit of man is essential and therefore eternal. It is a divine bounty. It is the effulgence of the Sun of Reality and therefore of greater importance than the physical body.

                 NATURE AND THE WORD

  NATURE is the material world. When we look upon it we see that it is dark and imperfect. For instance, if we allow a piece of land to remain in its natural condition, we will find it covered with thorns and thistles; useless weeds and wild vegetation will flourish upon it and it will become like a jungle. The trees will be fruitless, lacking beauty and symmetry; wild animals, noxious insects and reptiles will abound in its dark recesses. This is the incompleteness and imperfection of the world of nature. To chaAge these conditions, we must clear the ground and cultivate it so that flowers may grow instead of thorns and weeds; that is to say, we must illumine the dark world of nature. 

 In their primal natural state, the forests are dim, gloomy, impenetrable. 

 Man opens them to the light, clears away the tangled underbrush and plants fruitful trees. Soon the wild woodlands  and jungle are changed into productive  orchards and beautiful gardens; order has replaced chaos; the dark realm of nature has become illumined and brightened by Cultivation. 

 If man himself is left in his natural state, he will become lower than the animal and


<p160>
160             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  continue to grow more ignorant and imperfect.  The savage tribes of Central Africa are evidences of this. 

 Left in their natural condition, they have sunk to the lowest depths and degrees of barbarism, dimly groping in a world of mental and moral obscurity. If we wish to illumine this dark plane of human existence we must bring man forth from the hopeless captivity of nature, educate him and show him the pathway of light and knowledge, until, up-hf  ted from his condition of ignorance, he becomes wise and knowing; no longer savage and revengeful, lie becomes civilized and kind; once evil and sinister, he is endowed  with the attributes of heaven. But left in his natal condition without education  and training, it is certain that he will become more depraved and vicious than the animal, even to the extreme degree 

Witnessed  among African  
tribes who practice cannibalism.

 It is evident therefore that the world of nature is incomplete, imperfect until awakened and illumined by the light and stimulus of education. 

 In these days there are new schools of philosophy blindly claiming that the world of nature is perfect. If this is true, why are children trained and educated in schools, and what is the need of extended courses in sciences, arts and Letters in colleges and universities? What would be the result if humanity was left in its natal condition without education of training? All scientific discoveries and attainments are the outcomes of knowledge and education. The telegraph, phonograph, telephone were latent and potential in the world of nature but would never have come forth into the realm of visibility unless man through education had pentrared and discovered the laws which control them. All the marvelous  developments and miracles of what we call civilization would have remained hidden, unknown and so to speak, nonexistent, if man had remained in his natural conditon, deprived of the bounties, blessings and benefits of education and mental culture. The intrinsic difference between the ignorant man and the astute philosopher is that the former has not been lifted out of his natural condition, while the latter has undergone systematic training and edu cation in scbools and colleges until his mind has awakened and unfolded to higher realms of thought and perception; otherwise both are human and natural. 

 God has sent forth the prophets for the purpose of quickening the soui of man into higher and divine recognitions. He has revealed the heavenly books for this great purpose. 

 For this the breaths of the Holy Spirit have been wafted through the gardens of human hearts, the doors of the divine kingdom opened to mankind and the invisible inspirations sent forth from on high. This divine and ideal power has been bestowed upon man in order that he may purify himself from the imperfections of nature and uplift his soul to the realm of might and power. God has purposed that the darkness of the world of nature shall be dispelled and the imperfect attributes of the natal self be effaced in the effulgent reflection of the Sun of Truth. The mission  of the prophets of God has been to train the souls of humanity and free them from the thraldom of natural instincts and physical tendencies. 

 They are like unto gardeners, and the world of humanity is the field of their cultivation, the wilderness and untrained jungle growth wherein they proceed  to labor. 

 They cause the crooked branches to become straightened, the fruitless  trees to become fruitful, and gradually transform this great wild uncultivated field into a beautiful orchard producing wonderful abundance and outcome. 

 If the world of nature was perfect and complete in itself, there would be no need of such training and cultivation in the human world; no need of teachers, schools and universities, arts and crafts. The reve-larions of the prophets of God would not have been necessary and the heavenly books would have been superfluous. 

 If the world of nature was perfect and sufficient for mankind we would have no need of God and our belief in Him. Therefore the bestowal  of all these great helps and accessories to the attainment of divine life is because the world of nature is incomplete and imperfect. Consider this Canadian country during the early history of Montreal when the land was in its wild, uncui-tivated  and natural condition. The soil was


<p161>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 161

  unproductive, rocky and almost uninhabitable, vast forests stretching in every direction. What invisible power caused this great metropolis to spring up amid such savage and forbidding conditions? 
It was the human mind.     

 Therefore nature and the effect of nature's laws were imperfect. The mind of man remedied and removed this imperfect condition, until now we behold  a great city instead of a savage unbroken wilderness. Before the coming of Columbus, America itself was a wild, uncultivated expanse of primeval forest, mountains and rivers — a very world of nature. Now it has become the world of man. 

 It was dark, forbidding and savage; now it has become illumined with a great civilization and prosperity. Instead of forests, we behold productive farms, beautiful  gardens and prolific orchards. 

 Instead of thorns and useless vegetation, we find flowers, domestic animals and fields await~ ing harvest. If the world of nature was perfect, the condition of this great country would have been left unchanged. 

 If a child is left in its natural state and deprived of education, there is no doubt that it will grow up in ignorance and illiteracy,  its mental faculties dulled and dimmed; in fact it will become like an animal. This is evident among the savages of Central Africa who are scarcely higher than the beast in mental development. 

 The conclusion is irresistible that the splendors of the Sun of Truth, the Word of God have been the source and cause of human upbuilding and civilization. The world of nature is the kingdom of the animal. In its natural condition and plane of limitation the animal is perfect. The ferocious beasts of prey have been completely  subject to the laws of nature in their development. They are without education or training; they have no power of abstract reasoning and intellectual ideals; they have no touch with the spiritual world and are without conception of God or the Holy Spirit. 

 The animal can neither recognize  nor apprehend the spiritual power of man, and makes no distinction between man and itself for the reason that its susceptibilities  are limited to the plane of the senses. It lives under the bondage of nature and nature's laws. All the animals are materialists. 

 They are deniers of God and without realization of a transcendent power in the universe. They have no knowledge of the divine prophets and holy books; mere captives of nature and the sense world. 

 In reality they are like the great philosophers of this day who are not in touch with God and the Holy Spirit; deniers 6f the prophets, ignorant of spiritual susceptibilities, deprived  of the heavenly bounties and without belief in the power supernatural. 

 The animal lives this kind of life blissfully and untroubled whereas the material philosophers labor and study for ten or twenty years in schools and colleges, denying God, the Hdy Spirit and divine inspirations. The animal is even a greater philosopher, for it attains the ability to do this without labor and study. 

 For instance, the cow denies God and the Holy Spirit, knows nothing of divine inspirations, heavenly bounties or spiritual emotions and is a stranger to the world of hearts. Like the philosophers, the cow is a captive of nature and knows nothing beyond the range of the senses. 

 The philosophers however glory in this, saying, "We are not captives of superstitions;  we have implicit faith in the impressions of the senses and know nothing beyond the realm of nature which contains and covers everything." 

 But the cow with-our  study or proficiency in the sciences, modestly and quietly views life from the same standpoint, living in harmony with nature's laws in the utmost dignity and nobility. 

 This is not the glory of man. The glory of man is in the knowledge of God, spir~ itual susceptibilities, attainment to transcendent powers and the bounties of the Holy Spirit. The glory of man is in being informed of the teachings of God. 
This is the glory of humanity.

 Ignorance is not glory but darkness. Can these souls who are steeped in the lower strata of ignorance become informed of the mysteries of God and the realities of existence yet His Holiness  Jesus Christ be without knowledge of them? Is the intellect of these people greater than the intellect of 

Christ? His Holiness Christ

 was heavenly, divine and belonged to the world of the kingdom.

  He was the embodiment of spiritual knowledge. 

 His intellect was superior to these philosophers, his comprehension deeper, his perception keener, his knowledge more perfect. 

 How is it that he overlooked and denied himself everything in this world? He attached little importance to this material  life, denying himself rest and composure, accepting trials and voluntarily suffering vicissitudes because he was endowed with spiritual susceptibilities and the power of the Holy Spirit. He beheld the splendors of the divine kingdom, embodied the bounties of God and possessed ideal powers. He was illumined with love and mercy and so likewise were all the prophets of God.

THE MEDIATOR               

  HE divine Reality is unthinkable, limitless,  eternal, immortal and invisible. 

 The woild of creation is bound by natural  law, finite and mortal. 

 The infinite Reality cannot be said to ascend or descend. 

 It is beyond the understanding of man, and cannot be described in terms which apply to the phenomenal sphere of the created world. 

 Man, then, is in extreme need of the only power by which he is able to receive help from the divine reality, that power alone bringing him into contact with the source of all life. 

 An intermediary is needed to bring two extremes into relation with each other. Riches and poverty, plenty and need: without an intermediary power there could be no relation between these pairs of opposites. 

 So we can say that there must be a Mediator between God and man, and this is none other than the Holy Spirit, which brings the created earth into relation with the "Unthinkable One," the divine Reality. 

 The divine Reality may be likened to the sun and the Holy Spirit to the rays of the sun. As the rays of the sun bring the light and warmth of the sun to the earth, giving life to all created beings, so do the CCMani~ festations" bring the power of the Holy Spirit from the divine Sun of Reality to give light and life to the souls of men. 

 Behold, there is an intermediary necessary between the sun and the earth; the sun does not descend to the earth, neither does the earth ascend to the sun. This contact is made by the rays of the sun which bring light and warmth and heat. 

 The Holy Spirit is the light from the Sun of Truth bringing, by its infinite power, life and illumination to all mankind, flooding all souls with divine radiance, conveying  the blessings of God's mercy to the whole world. The earth, without the medium of the warmth and light of the rays of the sun, could receive no benefits from the sun. 

    Likewise the Holy Spirit   

 is the very cause of the life of man; without the Holy Spirit he would have no intellect, he would be unable to acquire his scientific knowledge by which his great influence over the rest of creation is gained. The illumination of the Holy Spirit gives to man the power of thought, and enables him to make discoveries  by which he bends the laws of nature to his will. 

 The Holy Spirit it is which, through the mediation of the prophets of God, teaches spiritual virtues to man and enables him to attain eternal life. 

 All these blessings are brought to man by the Holy Spirit; therefore we can understand  that the Holy Spirit is the Intermediary  between the creator and the created. 

 The light and heat of the sun cause the earth to be fruitful, and create life in all things that grow; and the Holy Spirit quickens the souis of men. 

 The two great Apostles, St. Peter and St. John the Evangelist, were once simple, humble workmen, toiling for their daily bread. 

 By the power of the Holy Spirit their souls were illumined, and they received the eternal blessings of 

Christ.

                THE MYSTERY OF SACRIFICE

  TIPHIS evening I wish to speak to you concerning the mystery of sacrifice. 

 There are two kinds of sacrifice, the physical and the spiritual. The explanation made by the churches concerning this subject is in reality superstition. 

 For instance it is recorded in the gospel that His Holiness Christ said, "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever." 

 He also said, CCThi wine is my blood which is shed for the remission of sins." These verses have been interpreted by the churches in such a superstitious way that it is impossible for human reason to understand or accept the explanation. 

 They say that His Holiness Adam disobeyed  the command of God and partook of the fruit of the forbidden tree thereby committing a sin which was transmitted as a heritage to his posterity. 

 They teach that because of Adam's sin all his descendants have likewise committed transgression and have become responsible through inheritance; consequently all mankind deserves punishment and must make retribution; and that God sent forth His son as a sacrifice  in order that man might be forgiven and the human race delivered from the consequences of Adam's transgression. 

 We wish to consider these statements from the standpoint of reason. Could we conceive of His Highness the Divinity who is justice itself, inflicting punishment upon the posterity of Adam for Adam s own sin and disobedience? Even if we should see a governor, an earthly ruler punishing a son for the wrongdoing of his father, we would look upon that ruler as an unjust man. Granted the father committed a wrong, what was the wrong committed by the son? There is no connection between the two. AWn-n's sin was not the sin of his posterity especially as Adam is a thousand generations back of the man today. If the father of a thousand generations committed a sin, is it just to demand that the present generation should suffer the consequences thereof? 

 There are other questions and evidences to be considered. 

His Holiness Abraham       

 was a manifestation of God and a descendant of Adam; likewise His 

Holiness Ishmaci, His      
Holiness Isaac, His Holiness

 Jeremiah and the whole line of prophets including David, Solomon and Aaron were among his posterity. Were all these holy men condemned to a realm of punishment because of a deed committed by the first father, because of a mistake said to have been made by their mutual and remotest ancestor His Holiness Adam? The explanation is made that when His Holiness Christ came and sacrificed himself, all the line of holy prophets who preceded him became free from sin and punishment. 

 Even a child could not justly make such an assertion. These interpretations and statements are due to a misunderstanding of the meanings of the 

Bible.                     

 In order to understand the reality of sacrifice let us consider the crucifixion and death of His Holiness Jesus Christ. It is true that be sacrificed himself for our sake. What is the meaning of this? 

When His Holiness Christ   

 appeared, he knew that be must proclaim himself in opposition to all the nations and peoples of the earth. He knew that mankind would arise against him and inflict upon him all manner of tribulations. 

 There is no doubt that one who put forth such a claim as Christ announced, would arouse the hostility of the world and be subjected to personal abuse. He realized that his blood would be shed and his body rent by violence. 

 Notwithstanding his knowledge of what would befall him, he arose to proclaim his message, suffered all tribulation and hardships from the people and finally offered his life as a sacrifice in order to illumine humanity; gave his blood in order to guide the world of mankind. He accepted every calamity and suffering in order to guide men to the truth. 

 Had he desired to save his own life and were he without wish to offer himself in sacrifice he would not have been able to guide a single soul. 

 There was no doubt that his blessed blood would be shed and his body broken. Nevertheless that hoiy soul accepted calam-fry and death in his love for mankind. This is one of the meanings of sacrifice.


<p164>
164             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  As to the second meaning, he said, N am the bread which came down from heaven." It was not the body of Christ which came from heaven. 

 His body came from the womb of Mary but the Christ perfections descended from heaven; the reality of Christ came down from heaven. 

 The spirit of Christ and not the body descended from heaven. The body of Christ was but human. There could be no question that the physical body was born from the womb of Mary. 

 But the reality of Christ, the spirit of Christ, the perfections of Christ all came from heaven. Consequently by saying  he was the bread which came from heaven he meant that the perfections which he showed forth were divine perfections, that the blessings within him were heavenly gifts and bestowals, that his light was the light of reality. 

 He said, "If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever." That is to say whosoever assimilates these divine perfections which are within me will never die; whosoever has a share and partakes of these heavenly bounties I embody will find eternal life; he who takes unto himself these divine lights shall find life everlasting. How manifest the meaning is! How evident! 

 For the soul which acquires divine perfections and seeks heavenly illumination from the teachings of Christ will undoubtedly  live eternally. This is also one of the mysteries of sacrifice. 

  In reality His Holiness    

 Abraham sacrificed  himself, for he brought heavenly teachings to the world and conferred heavenly food upon mankind. 

 As to the third meaning of sacrifice, it is this: — If you plant a seed in the ground a tree will become manifest from that seed. The seed sacrifices itself to the tree that will come from it. The seed is outwardly lost, destroyed but the same seed which is sacrificed will be absorbed and embodied in the tree, its blossoms, fruit and branches. If the identity of that seed had not been sacrificed to the tree which became manifest  from it, no branches, blossoms or fruits would have been forthcoming. 

 His Holiness  Christ outwardly disappeared. His personal identity became hidden from the eyes even as the identity of the seed disappeared, but the bounties, divine qualities and perfections of Christ became manifest iii the Christian community which Christ founded through sacrificing himself. When you look at the tree you will realize that the perfections, blessings, properties and beauty of the seed have become manifest in the branches, twigs, blossoms and fruit; consequently the seed has sacrificed itself to the tree. Had it not done so, the tree would not have come into existence. 

 His Holiness Christ like unto the seed sacrificed himself for the tree of 

Christianity. Therefore    

 his perfections, bounties, favors, lights and graces became manifest in the Christian community, for the coming of which he sacrificed himself. 

 As to the fourth significance of sacrifice, it is the principle that a reality sacrifices its own characteristics. 

 Man must sever himself from the influences of the world of matter, from the world of nature and its laws; for the material world is the world of corruption and death. It is the world of evil and darkness, of animalism and ferocity, bloodthirstiness, ambition and avarice, of self-worship, egotism and passion; it is the world of nature. 

 Man must strip himself of all these imperfections, must sacrifice these tendencies which are peculiar to the outer and material world of existence. 

 On the other hand man must acquire heavenly qualities and attain divine attributes. 

 He must become the image and likeness of God. He must seek the bounty of the eternal, become the manifester of the love of God, the light of guidance, the tree of life and the depository of the bounties of God. That is to say man must sacrifice the qualities and attributes of the world of nature for the qualities and attributes of the world of God. For instance  consider the substance we call iron. Observe its qualities; it is solid, black, cold. These are the characteristics of iron. 'When the same iron absorbs heat from the fire, it sacrifices its attribute of solidity for the attribute of fluidity. 

 It sacrifices its attribute of darkness for the attribute of light which is a quality of the lire. It sacrifices its attribute of coldness to the quality of heat which the fire possesses; so that in the iron there remains no solidity, darkness or cold. It becomes ilLumined and trans

  formed, having sacrificed its qualities to the qualities and attributes of the fire. 

 Likewise man when separated and severed from the attributes of the world of nature sacrifices the qualities and exigencies of that mortal realm and manifests the perfections of the Kingdom, just as the qualities of the iron disappeared and the qualities of the fire appeared in their place. 

 Every man trained through the teachings of God and illumined by the light of His guidance, who becomes a believer in God and His signs and is enkindled with the fire of the love of God sacrifices the imperfections  of nature for the sake of divine perfections. Consequently every perfect person, every illumined, heavenly individual stands in the station of sacrifice. 

 It is my hope that through the assistance and providence of God and through the bounties of the kingdom of AbM you may be entirely severed from the imperfections of the world of nature, purified from selfish, human desires, receiving life from the kingdom  of Abhi and attaining heavenly graces. May the divine light become manifest upon your faces, the fragrances of holiness refresh your nostrils and the breath of the Holy Spirit quicken you with eternal life.

             SPIRITUAL TRUTH IS REVEALED

  IT is a selfevident fact that phenomenal existence can never grasp nor comprehend the ancient and essential reality. Utter weakness cannot understand absolute strength. 

 When we view the worM of creation we discover differences in degree which make it impossible for the lower to comprehend the higher. For example, the mineral kingdom, no matter how much it may advance can never comprehend the phenomena of the vegetable kingdom. Whatever development the vegetable may attain, it can have no message from nor come in touch with the kingdom of the animal. 

 However perfect may be the growth of a tree it cannot realize the sensation of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch; these are beyond its limitation. Although it is the possessor of existence in the world of creation, a tree nevertheless has no knowledge of the superior degree of the animal kingdom. 

 Likewise no matter how great the advancement of the animal it can have no idea of the human plane; no knowledge of intellect and spirit. Difference in degree is an obstacle to this comprehension. 

 A lower degree cannot comprehend a higher although all are in the same world of creation, whether mineral, vegetable or animal. Degree is the barrier and limitation. 

 In the human plane of existence we can say we have knowledge of a vegetable, its qualities and product, hut the vegetable has no knowledge or corn-prehension ion whatever of us. No matter how near perfection this rose may advance in its own sphere it can never possess hearing and sight. Inasmuch as in the creational world which is phenomenal, difference of degree is an obstacle or hindrance to comprehension,  how can the human being, which is a created exigency, comprehend the ancient divine reality which is essential? 

 This is impossible because the reality of divinity is sanctified beyond the comprehension of the created being man. 

 Furthermore, that which man can grasp is finite to man, and man to it is as infinite. Is it possible then for the reality of divinity to be finite and the human creature infinite?  On the contrary the reverse is true; the human is finite while the essence of divinity is infinite. 

 Whatever comes within the sphere of human comprehension must be limited and finite. 

 As the essence of divinity transcends the comprehension of man, therefore God brings forth certain Manifestations of the divine reality upon whom He bestows heavenly effulgences in order that they may be intermediaries between  humanity and 

Himself. These holy Manifestations

 or prophets of God are as mirrors which have acquired illumination from the Sun of Truth, but the Sun does not descend from its high zenith and does not effect entrance within the mirror. In truth this mirror has attained complete polish and purity until the utmost capacity

  of reflection has been developed in it, therefore the Sun of Reality with its fulLest effulgence and splendor is revealed therein. These mirrors are earthly whereas the reality of divinity is in its highest apogee. Although its lights are shining and its heat is manifest in them, although these mirrors are telling their story of its effulgence, the Sun nevertheless remains in its own lofty station; it does not descend, it does not effect entrance, because it is holy and sanctified. 

 The Sun of Divinity and of Reality has revealed itself in various mirrors. 

 Though these mirrors are many, yet the Sun is one. The bestowals of God are one; the reality of the divine religion is one. Consider how the one and same light has reflected itself in the different mirrors or manifestations of it. There are certain souls who are lovers of the Sun; they perceive the effulgence of the Sun from every mirror. They are not fettered or attached to the mirrors; they are attached to the Sun itself and adore it no matter from what point it may shine. But those who adore the mirror and are attached to it, become deprived of witnessing the light of the Sun when it shines forth from another mirror. For instance, the Sun of Reality revealed itself from the Mosaic mirror. The people who were sincere accepted and believed in it. When the same Sun shone from the Messianic mirror, the Jews who were not lovers of the Sun and who were fettered by their adoration of the mirror of Moses did not perceive the lights and effulgences of the Sun of Reality resplendent in Jesus, therefore  they were deprived of its bestowals. Yet the Sun of Reality, the Word of God shone from the Messianic mirror through the wonderful channel of Jesus Christ more fully and more wonderfully. Its effulgences were manifestly radiant but even to this day the Jews are holding to t~e Mosaic mirror. Therefore they are bereft of witnessing the lights of eternity in Jesus. 

 In brief; the sun is one sun, the light is one light which shines upon all phenomend being. Every creature has a portion thereof, but the pure mirror can reveal the story of its bounty more fully and completely.  Therefore we must adore the light of the Sun no matter through what mirror it may be revealed. 

 We must not entertain prejudice, for prejudice is an obstacle to realization. Inasmuch as the effulgence is one effulgence, the human realities must all become recipients of the same light, recog-rnzing  in it the compelling force that unites them in its illumination. 

 As this is the radiant century, it is my hope that the Sun of Truth may illumine all humanity. 

 May the eyes be opened and the ears become attentive; may souls become  resuscitated and consort together in the utmost harmony as recipients of the same light.

               THE NEED OF AN EDUCATOR

  we consider existence, we see that the mineral, vegetable, animal, and human worlds are all in need of an educator. 

 If the earth is not cultivated it becomes a jungle where useless weeds grow; but if a cultivator comes and tills the ground, it produces crops which nourish living creatures. 

 It is evident, therefore, that the soil needs the cultivation of the farmer. 

 Consider  the trees: if they remain without a cultivator they will be fruitless, and without  fruit they are useless; but if they receive the care of a gardener, these same barren trees become fruitful, and through cultivation, fertilization, and engrafting, the trees which had bitter fruits yield sweet fruits. 

 These are rational proofs; in this age the peoples of the world need the arguments  of reason. 

 The same is true with respect to animals: notice that when the animal is trained it becomes domestic, and also that man, if he is left without training, becomes bestial, and, moreover, if left under the rule of nature, becomes lower than an animal; whereas if he is educated he becomes an angel. For the greater number of animals

EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 167

  do not devour their own kind, but men, among the negroes of Central Africa, kill and eat each other. 

 Now reflect that it is education that brings the East and the West under the authority of man; it is education that produces  wonderful industries; it is education that spreads glorious sciences and arts; it is education that makes manifest new discoveries  and laws. 

 If there were no educator, there would be no such things as comforts, civilization, facilities, or humanity. 

 If a man be left alone in a wilderness where he sees none of his own kind, he will undoubtedly become a mere brute; it is then clear that an educator is needed. 

 But ~ducation is of three kinds: material, human, and spiritual. Material education is concerned with the progress and development  of the body, through gaining its sustenance, its material comfort and ease. This education is common to animals and man. 

 Human education signifies civilization and progress: that is to say, government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and handicrafts, sciences, great inventions  and discoveries of physical laws, which are the activities essential to man as distinguished from the animal. 

 Divine education is that of the Kingdom of God: it consists in acquiring divine perfections,  and this is true education; for in this estate man becomes the center of divine appearance, the manifestation of the words, ccLet us make man in our image and after our likeness." This is the supreme goal of the world of humanity. 

 Now we need an educator who will be at the same time a material, human, and spiritual educator, and whose authority will be effective in all conditions. 

 So if any one should say, "I possess perfect comprehension and intelligence, and I have no need of such an educator," he would be denying that which is clear and evident, as though a child should say, "I have no need of education;  I will act according to my reason and intelligence, and so I shall attain the perfections  of existence"; or as though the blind should say, ttj am in no need of sight, because many other blind people exist without  difficulty." 

 Then it is plain and evident that man needs an educator, and this educator must be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in all respects, and distinguished above all men. For otherwise he cannot be their educator. 

 More particularly because he must be at the same time their material and human as well as their spiritual educator; that is to say, he will teach men to organise and carry out physical matters, and to regulate the form of society with regard to the establThhing of help and assistance in life, so that material affairs may be organized  and regulated for any circumstances that may occur. In the same way he will establish human education; that is to say, he must educate intelligence and thought in such a way that they may attain complete development, so that knowledge and science may increase, and the reality of things, the mysteries of beings, and the properties of existence may be discovered; that day by day instructions, inventions, and laws may be improved; and from things perceptible to the senses conclusions as to intellectual things may be deduced. 

 He must also impart spiritual education; so that intelligence and comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world, and may receive benefit from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit, and may enter into relationship with the Supren-ie Concourse. He must so educate the human reality that it may become the center of the divine appearance, to such a degree that the attributes  and the names of God shall be resplendent in the mirror of the reality of man, and the holy verse, c~nwe will make man in Our image and likeness," shall become  true. 

 It is clear that human power is not able to fill such a great office, and that the reason alone could not undertake the responsibility  of so great a mission. How can one solitary person without help and without support lay the foundations of such a noble construction? 

 He must depend on the help of the spiritual and divine power to be able to undertake this mission. One Holy Soul gives life to the world of humanity, changes the aspect of the terrestrial globe, causes intelligence to progress, vivifies souls, lays the foundation of a new

  existence, establishes the basis of a marvellous creation, organizes the world, brings nations and religions under the shadow of one standard, delivers man from the world of imperfections and vices, and inspires him with the desire and need of natural and acquired perfections. Certainly nothing short of a divine power could accomplish so great a work. We ought to consider this with justice, for this is the office of justice. 

 A Cause which all the governments and peoples of the world, with all their powers and armies, cannot promulgate and spread, one Holy Soul can promote without help or support! Can this be done by human power? No, in the name of God! For example, Christ, alone and solitary, upraised  the standard of spiritual peace and righteousness, a work which all the victorious  governments with all their hosts were unable to accomplish. 

 Consider what was the fate of so many and diverse empires  and peoples: the Roman Empire, France, Germany, Russia, England, etc.; all were gathered together under the same tent; that is to say, the appearance of Christ brought about a union among these diverse nations; some of whom, under the influence of Christianity, became so united that they sacrificed their lives and property for one another. After the time of Constantine, who was the protagonist of Christianity,  divisions broke out among them. The point I wish to make is that Christ sustained a cause that all the kings of the earth could not establish! He united the various religions and modified ancient customs. Consider what great divergences existed between  IRomans, Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Phcrnicians, Israelites, and other peopies of Europe. Christ removed these divergences, and became the cause of love between these communities. 

 Although after some time empires destroyed this union, the work of Christ was accomplished. 

 Therefore the universal educator must be at the same time not oniy a material, but also a human and spiritual educator; and he must possess a supernatural power, so that he may hold the position of a divine teacher. If he does not show forth such a holy power, he will not be able to educate, for if he be imperfect, how can he give a perfect education? if he be ignorant, how can he make others wise? If he be unjust, how can he make others just? If he be earthly, how can he make others heavenly? 

 Now we must consider justly: did these Divine Manifestations 1 who have appeared possess all these qualifications or not? If they had not these qualifications and these perfections, they were not real educators. 

 Therefore it must be our task to prove to the thoughtful by reasonable arguments the prophethood of Moses, of Christ, and of the other Divine Manifestations. 

 And the proofs and evidences which we give must not be based on traditional but on rational arguments. 

 It has now been proved by rational arguments that the world of existence is in the utmost need of an educator, and that its education must be effected by a divine power. 

 There is no doubt that this holy power is due to inspiration, and that the world must be educated through this power which is above human power.

             THE FIVE ASPECTS OF SPIRIT

  KNOW that, speaking generally, there are five divisions of the spirit. First the vegetable spirit: this is a power which results from the combination of elements and the mingling of substances by the decree of the Supreme God, and from the influence, the effect, and connection of other existences. When these substances and elements are separated from each other, the power of growth also ceases to exist; so, to use another figure, eLectricity results from the combination of elements, and when these elements are separated, the electric force is dispersed and lost. Such is the vegetable spirit. 

 After this is the animal spirit, which also


<p169>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 169

  results from the mingling and combination of elements; but this combination is more complete, and through the decree of the Almighty Lord a perfect mingling is obtained, and the animal spirit, in other words the power of the senses, is produced. 

 It will perceive the reality of things from that which is seen and visible, audible, edible, tangible, and that which can be smelt. 

 After the dissociation and decomposition  of the combined elements, this spirit also will naturally disappear. 

 It is like this lamp which you see: when the oil and wick and fire are brought together, light is the result; but when the oil is finished and the wick consumed, the light will also vanish and be lost. 

 The human spirit may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on crystal. The body of man, which is composed from the elements, is combined and mingled in the most perfect form; it is the most solid construction, the noblest combination, the most perfect existence. 

 It grows and de~ velops through the animal spirit. 

 This perfected body can be compared to a crystal, and the human spirit to the sun. Nevertheless, if the crystal breaks, the bounty of the sun continues; and if the crystal is destroyed or ceases to exist, no harm will happen to the bounty of the sun which is everlasting. 

 This spirit has the power of discovery; it encompasses all things. All these wonderful signs, these scientific discoveries, great enterprises and important historical events which you know, are due to it. From the realm of the invisible and hidden, through spiritual power, it brought them to the plane of the visible. 

 So, man is upon the earth, yet he makes discoveries in the heavens. From known realities, that is to say from the things which are known and visible, he discovers  unknown things. For example, mail is in this hemisphere, but, like Columbus, through the power of his reason he discovers  another hemisphere, that is America, which was until then unknown. 

 His body is heavy, but through the help of an instrument  which be invents, he is able to soar aloft. 

 He is slow of movement, but by an instrument which he invents he travels to the East and 'West with extreme rapidity. Briefly, this power embraces all things. 

 But the spirit of man has two aspects: one divine, one satanic; that is to say, it is capable of the utmost perfection, or it is capable of the utmost imperfection. 

 If it acquires virtues it is the most noble of the existing beings, and if it acquires vices it becomes the most degraded existence. 

 The fourth degree of spirit is the heavenly spirit; it is the spirit of faith and the bounty of God; it comes from the breath of the Holy Spirit, and by the divine power it becomes the cause of eternal life. It is the power which makes the earthly man heavenly, and the imperfect man perfect.  It makes the impure to be pure, the silent eloquent; it purifies and sanctifies those made captive by carnal desires; it makes the ignorant wise. 
    The fifth spirit is the   

Holy Spirit. This Holy    

 Spirit is the mediator between God and His creatures. 

 It is iike a mirror facing the sun. As the pure mirror receives  light from the sun and transmits this bounty to others, so the Holy Spirit is the mediator of the Holy Light from the Sun of Reality, which it gives to the sancti —  fled realities. 

 It is adorned with all the divine perfections. 

 Every time it appears the world is renewed, and a new cycle is founded. 

 The body of the world of humanity puts on a new garment. It can be compared to the spring; whenever it comes, the world passes from one condition to another. 

 Through the advent of the season of spring the black earth and the fields and wildernesses will become verdant and blooming, and all sorts of flowers and sweet-scented herbs will grow; the trees will have new life, and new fruits will appear, and a new cycle is founded. 

 The appearance  of the Holy Spirit is like this. 

 Whenever  it appears, it renews the world of humanity and gives a new spirit to the human realities: it arrays the world of existence in a praiseworthy garment, dispels  the darkness of ignorance, and causes the radiation of the light of perfections. Christ with this power has renewed this cycle; the heavenly spring with the utmost freshness and sweetness spread its tent in

  the world of humanity, and the life-giving breeze perfumed the nostrils of the enlightened  ones. 

 In the same way, the appearance of Baha'u'llah was like a new springtime which appeared with holy breezes, with the hosts of everlasting life, and with heavenly power. It established the Throne of the Divine Kingdom in the center of the world, and by the power of the Holy Spirit re. 'viyed souis and established a new cycle.

  THE DIVINITY CAN ONLY BE COMPREHENDED THROUGH THE

                DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS

  Question. — What connection has the Reality of Divinity with the Lordly Rising-places and the Divine Dawning-points? 

 Answer. — Know that the Reality of Divinity or the substance of the Essence of Oneness is pure sanctity and absolute holiness:  that is to say, it is sanctified and exempt from all praise. 

 The whole of the supreme attributes of the degrees of existence,  in reference to this plane, are oniy imaginations. 

 It is invisible, incomprehensible, inaccessible, a pure essence which cannot be described; for the Divine Essence surrounds all things. Verily that which surrounds is greater than the surrounded, and the surrounded cannot contain that by which it is surrounded, nor comprehend its reality. 

 However far mind may progress, though it may reach to the final degree of comprehension, the limit of understanding, it beholds the divine signs and attributes in the world of creation, and not in the world of God. 

 For the essence and the attributes of the Lord of Unity are in the heights of sanctity, and for the minds and understandings there is no way to approach that position. tThe way is closed and seeking is forbidden." 

  IT is evident that the human understanding  is a quality of the existence of man, and that man is a sign of God, how can the quality of the sign surround the creator of the sign? that is to say, how can the understanding which is a quality of the existence of man, comprehend God? Therefore the Reality of the Divinity is hidden from all comprehension, and concealed from the minds of all men. It is absolutely impossible to ascend to that plane. 

 'We see that everything which is lower is powerless to comprehend the reality of that which is higher. So the stone, the earth, the tree, however much they may evolve, cannot comprehend the reality of man, and cannot imagine the powers of sight, of hearing, and of the other senses, although they are all alike created. Therefore how can man, the created, understand the reality of the pure Essence of the Creator? This plane is unapproachable by the understanding, no explanation is sufficient for its comprehension,  and there is no power to indicate it. What has an atom of dust to do with the pure world, and what relation is there between  the limited mind and the infinite world? Minds are powerless to comprehend God, and the souis become bewildered in explaining Him. "The eyes see Him not, but He seeth the eyes. He is the Omniscient, the Knower."' Consequently, with reference to this plane of existence, every statement and elucidation is defective, all praise and all description are unworthy, every conception is vain, and every meditation is futile. But for this Essence of the essences, this Truth of truths, this Mystery of mysteries, there are reflections, auroras, appearances and resplendencies,  in the world of existence. 

 The dawning-place of these splendors, the place of these reflections, and the appearance of these manifestations, are the Holy Dawn-ing-places, the Universal Realities and the Divine Beings, who are the true mirrors of the sanctified Essence of God. All the perfections, the bounties, the splendors which come from God, are visible and evident  in the Reality of the Holy Manifestations, like the sun which is resplendent in a clear polished mirror with all its perfections  and bounties. If it be said that the mirrors are the manifestations of the sun ' Qur'an, S&ih 6.


<p171>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 171

  and the dawning-places of the rising star, this does not mean that the sun has descended  from the height of its sanctity and become incorporated in the mirror, nor that the Unlimited Reality is limited to this place of appearance. God forbid! 

 This is the belief of the adherents of anthropornor-phism. 

 No; all the praises, the descriptions and exaltations refer to the Holy Manifestations. 

 That is to say, all the descriptions, the qualities, the names and the attributes which we mention, return to the Divine Manifestations; but as no one has attained to the reality of the Essence of Divinity, so no one is able to describe, explain, praise or glorify it. Therefore all that the human reality knows, discovers, and understands of the names, the attributes, and the perfec-dons  of God, refer to these Holy 

Manifestations.  There    

 is no access to anything else: "the way is closed, and seeking is forbidden." 

 Nevertheless we speak of the names and attributes of the Divine Reality, and we praise Him by attributing to Him sight, hearing, power, life, and knowledge. 

 We affirm these names and attributes, not to prove the perfections of God, but to deny that He is capable of imperfections. 

 When we look at the existing world, we see that ignorance is imperfection and knowledge is perfection, therefore we say that the sancti-fled Essence of God is wisdom. 

 Weakness is imperfection and power is perfection; consequently we say that the sanctified Essence  of God is the acme of power. It is not that we can comprehend His knowledge, His sight, His power and life, for it is beyond  our comprehension; for the essential names and attributes of God are identical with His 

Essence, and His Essence   
is above all comprehension.

 If the attributes are not identical with the Essence, there must also be a multiplicity of preexistences, and differences between the attributes and the Essence must also exist: and as Preexistence is necessary, therefore the sequence of pre —  existences would become infinite. 
This is an evident error.  

 Accordingly all these attributes, names, praises, and eulogies apply to the Places of Manifestation; and all that we imagine and suppose beside them is mere imagination, for we have no means of comprehending that which is invisible and inaccessible. This is why it is said: C(AJJ that you have distinguished through the illusion of your imagination in your subtle mental images, is but a creation like unto yourself, and returns to you." 1 It is clear that if we wish to imagine the Reality of Divinity, this imagination is the surrounded, and we are the surrounding one; and it is sure that the one who surrounds is greater than the surrounded. 

 From this it is certain and evident that if we imagine a Divine Reality outside of the HdLy Manifestations, it is pure imagination; for there is no way to approach the Reality of Divinity which is nor cut off to us, and all that we imagine is mere supposition. 

 Therefore reflect that different peoples of the world are revolving around imagina-Uons,  and are worshippers of the idols of thoughts and conjectures. 

 They are not aware of this; they consider their imaginations  to be the Reality which is withdrawn from all comprehension, and purified from all descriptions. 

 They regard themselves as the people of Unity, and the others as worshippers of idbls; but idols at least have a mineral existence, while the idols of thoughts and the imaginations of man are but fancies; they have not even mineral existence. 

 C(Take warning, 0 possessors of perception!" 

 Know that the attributes of perfection, the splendor of the divine bounties, and the lights of inspiration, are visible and evident in all the Holy Manifestations; but the glorious Word of God, Christ, and the Greatest Name, Baha'u'llah, are manifestations  and evidences which are beyond imagination; for they possess all the perfections of the former Manifestations, and more than that, they possess some perfections which make the other Manifestations dependent upon them. So all the Prophets of Israel were centers of inspiration; Christ also was a receiver of inspiration; but what a difference  between the inspiration of the Word of God and the revelations of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Elijah! 

 Reflect that light is the expression of the vibrations of the etheric matter: the nerves 1 From a kladith.

  of the eye are affected by these vibrations, and sight is produced. The light of the lamp exists through the vibration of the etheric matter, so also does that of the sun; but what a difference between the light of the sun and that of the stars or the lamp! 

 The spirit of man appears and is manifest in the embryonic condition, and also in that of childhood and of maturity, and it is resplendent and evident in the condition of perfection. The spirit is one, but in the embryonic condition the power of sight and of hearing is lacking. In the state of maturity and perfection it appears in the utmost splendor and brilliance. 

 In the same way the seed in the beginning becomes leaves, and is the place where the vegetable spirit appears; in the condition of fruit it manifests the same spirit, that is to say, the power of growth appears in the utmost perfection: but what a difference between the condition of the leaves and that of the fruit! 

 For from the fruit a hundred thousand  leaves appear, though they all grow and develop through the same vegetable spirit. 

 Notice the difference between the virtues and perfections of Christ, the splendors and brilliance of Baha'u'llah, and the virtues of the Prophets of Israel, such as Ezekiel or Samuel. All were the manifestations  of inspiration, but between them there is an infinite difference.

  THE THREE STATIONS OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS

  KNOW' that the Holy Manifestations, though they have the degrees of endless perfections, yet, speaking generally, have only three stations. 

 The first station is the physical; the second station is the human, which is that of the rational soul; the third is that of the divine appearance and the heavenly splendor. 

 The physical station is phenomenal; it is composed of elements, and necessarily everything that is composed is subject to decomposition: it is not possible that a composition should not be disintegrated. 

 The second is the station of the rational soul, Which is the human reality; this also is phenomenal, and the Holy Manifestations share it with all mankind. 

 Know that, although the human soul has existed on the earth for prolonged times and ages, yet it is phenomenal. As it is a divine sign, when once it has come into existence it is eternal. The spirit of man has a beginning, but it has no end; it con —  tinues eternally. 

 In the same way the species existing on this earth are phenomenal,  f or it is established that there was a time when these species did not exist on the surface of the earth. Moreover, the earth has not always existed, but the world of existence has always been; for the universe is not limited to this terrestrial globe. The meaning of this is, that although human souis are phenomenal, they are nevertheless immortal, everlasting, and perpetual; for the world of things is the world of imperfection in comparison with that of man, and the world of man is the world of perfection  in comparison with that of things. When imperfections reach the station of perfection, they become eternal.' 

 This is an example of which you must comprehend the meaning. 

 The third station is that of the divine appearance and heavenly splendor: it is the Word of God, the Eternal Bounty, the Holy Spirit. It has neither beginning nor end, for these things are related to the world of contingencies, and not to the divine world. For God, the end is the same thing as the beginning. So the reckoning of days, weeks, months, and years, of yesterday and today, is connected with the terrestrial globe; but in the sun there is no such thing — there is neither yesterday, today, nor tomorrow, neither months nor years — all are equal. In the same way the Word of God is purified from all these conditions and is exempt from the boundaries, the laws, and the limits of the world of contingency. 

 Therefore the reality of prophethood, which is the Word of God and the perfect state of manifestation, did 1 i.e. in the kingdom of man, where alone the Spirit manifests immortality.

  not have any beginning, and will not have any end; its rising is different from all others, and is like that of the sun. For example,  its dawning in the sign of Christ was with the utmost splendor and radiance, and this is eternal and everlasting. 

 See how many conquering kings there have been, how many statesmen and princes, powerful organizers, all of whom have disappeared, whereas the breezes of Christ are still blowing,  his light is still shining, his melody is still resounding, his standard is still waving, his armies are still fighting, his heavenly voice is still sweetly melodious, his clouds are still showering gems, his lightning is still flashing, his reflection is still clear and brilliant, his splendor is still radiating and luminous; and it is the same with those souls who are under his protection and are shining with his light. 

 Then it is evident that the Manifestations possess three conditions: the physical condition,  the condition of the rational soul, and the condition of the divine appearance and heavenly splendor. The physical condition  will certainly become decomposed, but the condition of the rational soul, though it has a beginning, has no end: nay, it is endowed with everlasting life. 

 But the Holy Reality, of which 

Christ says "The Father    

 is in the Son," has neither beginning nor end. When beginning is spoken of, it signifies the state of manifesting; and symbolically, the condition of silence is compared  to sleep. 

 For example, a man is sleeping  — when he begins to speak he is awake —  but it is always the same individual, whether he be asleep or awake; no difference has occurred in his station, his elevation, his glory, his reality, or his nature. The state of silence is compared to sleep, and that of manifestation to wakefulness. A man sleeping or waking is the same man; sicep is one state, and wakefulness is another. The time of silence is compared to sleep, and manifestation and guidance are compared to wakefulness. 

 In the Gospel it is said, "In the beginning  was the Word, and the NVord was with God." Then it is evident and clear that Christ did not reach to the station of Mcssiahship and its perfections at the time of baptism, when the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the likeness of a dove. Nay, the Word of God from all eternity has always  been, and will be, in the exaltation of sanctification. 

Some Answered Questions.   
                           
 THE HUMAN CONDITION AND THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF

              THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS

  WE said that the Manifestations have three planes. First, the physical reality, which depends upon the body; secondly, the individual reality, that is to say, the rational soul; thirdly, the divine appearance, which is the divine perfections, the cause of the life of existence, of the education of souls, of the guidance of p~ople, and of the enlightenment of the contingent world. 

 The physical state is the human state which perishes, because it is composed of elements, and all that is composed of elements  will necessarily be decomposed and dispersed. 

 But the individual reality of the Manifestations of God is a holy reality, and for that reason it is sanctified, and in that which concerns its nature and quality, is distinguished from all other things. 

 It is like the sun, which by its essential nature produces light, and cannot be compared to the moon, just as the particles that compose  the globe of the sun cannot be compared  with those which compose the moon. The particles and organization of the former produce rays, but the particles of which the moon is composed do not produce rays, but need to borrow light. 

 So other human realities are those souls who, like the moon, take light from the sun; but that holy reality  is luminous in himself. 

 The third plane of that Being 1 is the Divine Bounty, the splendor of the Preexistent  Beauty, and the radiance of the light of the Almighty. The individual realities of the Divine Manifestations have no separation from the Bounty of God and 

1 The Manifestation.


<p174>

  the Lordly Splendor. In the same way the orb of the sun has no separation from the light. Therefore it may be said that the ascension of the Holy Manifestation is simply the leaving of this elemental form. For example, if a lamp illumines this niche, and if its light ceases to illuminate it because  the niche is destroyed, the bounty of the lamp is not cut off. Briefly, in the Holy 

Manifestations the Preexistent

 Bounty is like the light, the individuality is represented  by the glass globe, and the human body is like the niche: if the niche is destroyed, the lamp continues to burn. The Divine Manifestations are so many different mirrors, because they have a special individuality,  but that which is reflected in the mirrors is one sun. It is clear that the reality of Christ is different from that of Moses. 

 Verily from the beginning that Holy Reality 1 is conscious of the secret of existence,  and from the age of childhood signs of greatness appear and are visible in him. Therefore how can it be that with all these bounties and perfections he should have no consciousness? 

 We have mentioned that the Holy Manifestations have three planes. The physical condition, the individual reality, and the center of the appearance of perfection: it is like the sun, its heat and its light. Other individuals have the physical plane, the 

1 The Manifestation.      

 plane of the rational soul — the spirit and mind. 

 So the saying ~ was asleep and the divine breezes passed over me and I awoke," is like Christ's saying: ccThe body is sad and the spirit is happy," or again: ~tJ am afflicted, or I am at ease, or I am troubled" — these refer to the physical condition, and have no reference to the individual reality nor to the manifestation of the Divine Reality. 

 Thus consider what thousands of vicissitudes can happen to the body of man, but the spirit is not affected by them; it may even be that some members of the body are entirely crippled, but the essence of the mind remains and is everlasting. A thousand accidents may happen to a garment,  but for the wearer of it there is no danger. These words which Baha'u'llah said: ~ was asleep, and the breeze passed over me and awakened me," refer to the body. 

 In the world of God there is no past, no future, and no present; all are one. So when Christ said: ttJn the beginning was the Word" — that means it was, is, and shall be; for in the world of God there is no time. Time has sway over creatures, but not over God. For example, in the prayer he says: !tThy name is hallowed"; the meaning is that Thy name was, is, and shall be hallowed.  Morning, noon, and evening are related to this earth, but in the sun there is neither morning, noon, nor evening. 

Some Answered Questions.  
                          
     THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS

  Question. — One of the powers possessed by the Divine Manifestations is knowledge: to what extent is it limited? 

 Answer. — Knowledge is of two kinds: one is subjective, and the other objective knowledge; that is to say, an intuitive knowledge and a knowledge derived from perception. 

  HE knowledge of things which men universally have, is gained by reflection or by evidence: that is to say, either by the power of the mind the conception of an object is formed, or from beholding an object  the form is produced in the mirror of the heart. The circle of this knowledge is very limited, because it depends upon effort and attainment. 

 But the second. sort of knowledge, which is the knowledge of being, is intuitive, it is like the cognizance and consciousness that man has of himself. 

 For example, the mind and the spirit of man are cognizant of the conditions and states of the members and component parts of the body, and are aware of all the physical  sensations; in the same way they are aware of their power, of their feelings, and of their spiritual conditions. 

 This is the knowledge of being which man realizes and

EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 175

  perceives; for the spirit surrounds the body, and is aware of its sensations and powers. This knowledge is not the outcome of effort and study; it is an existing thing, it is an absolute gift. 

 Since the Sanctified Realities, the universal  Manifestations of God, surround the essence and qualities of the creatures, transcend and contain existing realities and understand all things, therefore their knowledge  is divine knowledge, and not acquired: that is to say, it is a holy bounty, it is a divine revelation. 

 We will mention an example, expressly for the purpose of comprehending this subject.  The most noble being on the earth is man. He embraces the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms: that is to say, these conditions are contained in him to such an extent that he is the possessor of these conditions  and states; he is aware of their mysteries  and of the secrets of their existence. This is simply an example, and not an analogy. 
Briefly, the universal     

Manifestations  of God    

 are aware of the reality of the mysteries of beings, therefore they establish laws which are suitable and adapted to the state of the world of man; for religion is the essential connection which proceeds from the realities of things. 

 The Manifestation,  that is, the Holy Lawgiver, unless he is aware of the realities of beings, will not comprehend the essential connection which proceeds from the realities of things, and he will certainly not be able to establish a religion conformable to the facts and suited to the conditions. The Prophets of God, the universal Manifestations, are like skilled physicians, and the contingent world is like the body of man: the divine laws are the remedy and treatment. 

 Consequently  the doctor must be aware of, and know, all the members and parts, as well as the constitution and state of the patient, so that he can prescribe a medicine which will be beneficial against the violent poison of the disease. In reality the doctor deduces from the disease itself the treatment  which is suited to the patient, for he diagnoses the malady, and afterwards prescribes  the remedy for the illness. Until the malady be discovered, how can the remedy and treatment be prescribed? 

 The doctor then must have a thorough knowledge of the constitution, members, organs, and state of the patient, and be acquainted with all diseases and all remedies, in order to prescribe a fitting medicine. 

 Religion, then, is the necessary connection which emanates from the reality of things; and as the universal Manifestations of God are aware of the mysteries of beings, therefore they understand this essential  connection, and by this knowledge establish the Law of God.

                THE UNIVERSAL CYCLES

  Question. — .What is the real explanation of the cycles which occur in the world of existence? 

 Answer. — Each one of the luminous bodies in this limitless firmament has a cycle of revolution which is of a different duration, and every one revolves in its own orbit, and again begins a new cycle. 

 So the earth, every three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes and a fraction, completes a revolution; and then it begins a new cycle, that is to say, the first cycle is again renewed. In the same way, for the whole universe, whether for the heavens or for men, there are cycles of great events, of important facts and occurrences. 

 rences. When a cycie is ended, a new cycle begins, and the old one, on account of the great events which take place, is completely forgotten, and not a trace or record of it will remain. As you see, we have no records of twenty thousand years ago, although we have before proved by argument that life on this earth is very ancient. It is not one hundred thousand, or two hundred thousand, or one million or two million years old; it is very ancient, and the ancient records  and traces are entirely obliterated. 

  EACH of the Divine Manifestations has likewise a cycle, and during the cycle his laws and commandments prevail and are

EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS 177

  performed. When his cycle is completed by the appearance of a new Manifestation, a new cycie begins. In this way cycles begin, end, and are renewed, until a universal  cycle is completed in the world, when important events and great occurrences will take place which entirely efface every trace and every record of the past; then a new universal cycle begins in the world, for this universe has no beginning. We have before  stated proofs and evidences concerning this subject; there is no need of repetition. 

 Briefly, we say a universal cycle in the world of existence signifies a long duration of time, and innumerable and incalculable periods and epochs. In such a cycle the Manifestations appear with splendor in the realm of the visible, until a great and universal Manifestation makes the world the center of his radiance. His appearance causes the world to attain to maturity, and the extension of his cycie is very great. Afterwards other Manifestations will arise under his shadow, who according to the needs of the time will renew certain commandments relating to material questions and affairs, while remaining under his shadow. 

 We are in the cycle which began with Adam, and its universal Manifestation is Baha'u'llah.

THE WORLD ORDER OF
                     BAHA'U'LLAH
          PRESENTDAY ADMINISTRATION OF THE
                    BAHA'I FAITH

               INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

                  By Horace Holley

  IT HAS been the general characteristic of religion that organization marks the interruption  of the true spiritual influence and serves to prevent the original impulse from being carried into the world. The organization has invariably become a substitute for religion rather than a method or an instrument  used to give the religion effect. The separation of peoples into different traditions unbridged by any peaceful or constructive intercourse has made this inevitable. 

 Up to the present time, in fact, no Founder of a revealed religion has explicitly laid down the principles that should guide the administrative machinery of the Faith He has established. 

 In the Baha'i Cause, the principles of world administration were expressed by Baha'u'llah,  and these principles were developed in the writings of tAbdu'1-Bahi, more especially  in His 

Will and Testament.        

 The purpose of this organization is to make possible a true and lasting unity among peoples of different races, classes, interests, characters, and inherited creeds. 

 A close and sympathetic study of this aspect of the Baha'i Cause will show that the purpose and method of Baha'i administration is so perfectly adapted to the fundamental spirit of the Revelation that it bears to it the same relationship as body to soul. In character, the principles of Baha'i administration  represent the science of cooperation; in application, they provide for a new and higher type of morality worldwide in scope. In the clash and confusion of sectarian prejudice, the Baha'i religion is impartial and sympathetic, offering a foundation upon which reconciliation can be firmly based. Amid the complex interrelations of governments,  the religion stands absolutely neutral as to political purposes and entirely obedient to all recognized authority. 

 It will not be overlooked by the student that Baha'u'llah is the oniy religious teacher making obedience to just governments and rulers a definite spiritual command. 

 In this brief analysis of the several features of the Baha'i system of administration the purpose is rather to place in the hands or the believers themselves a convenient summary of the available instructions than to clarify this aspect of the teachings to the non-BabA'i. Until one has made contact  with the spirit of the Baha'i teachings and desires to cooperate wholeheartedly with their purpose, the administrative phase of the Faith can have little real meaning or appeal. 

 At the time of the passing of tAbdu'1-BaM,  the organization was fully defined but not yet established among His followers.  The responsibility for carrying out the instructions was placed by tAbdu'1-BaM upon His grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to whom was assigned the function of "Guard-ian of the Cause." Obedience to the authority  of the Guardian was definitely enjoined  upon all Baha by tAbdu'1-Bah4, but this authority carries with it nothing of an arbitrary or personal character, being limited as to purpose and method by the writings of Baha'u'llah and ~Abd'IBh' The Guardian unifies the efforts to bring 181


<p182>
182             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  into complete application those principles of world administration already clearly defined. 

 To assist the Guardian in his manifold responsibilities and duties and particularly in the promotion of the teaching work, tAb-du'1-Bahi provided for the appointment of a group of coworkers to be known as "The Hands of the Cause of God." 

 The appointment  of this body is a function of the Guardian, and these from their own number are to elect nine persons who will be closely associated with the Guardian in the discharge of his duties. 

 It is the function of the Guardian also to appoint his own successor, this appointment to be ratified by the nine Hands of the Cause. 

 It is the genius of the Baha'i Faith that the principle underlying the administration of its affairs aims to improve the life and uphuild the character of the individual believer  in his own local community, wherever  it may be, and not to enhance the prestige of those relatively few who, by election or appointment, hold positions of higher authority. 

 Baha'i authority is measured by self-sacrifice and not by arbitrary power. 

 This fundamental aim can be seen clearly on studying the significant emphasis which tAbdu'1-BahA placed upon the local Baha'i community. The local group, involving  as it does men and women in all the normal activities and relations of life, is the foundation upon which rests the entire  evolution of the Cause. The local Baha'i  community is given official recognition oniy after its number of adult declared believers  has become nine or more. 

 Up to this point, the community exists as a voluntary  group of workers and students of the Cause. 

 In this connection, the word ttcommu-nity"  is not used in the sense of any local-fry,  exclusively Baha'i in membership, nor of any manner of living differing outwardly from the general environment, such as has been attempted by religionists and also members of philosophic and economic movements  in the past. 

 A Baha'i community is a unity of minds and hearts, an association of people entirely vdluntary in character, established upon a common experience of devotion to the universal aims of Baha'u'llah and agreement as to the methods by which these aims can be advanced. 

 A Baha community differs from other voluntary gatherings in that its foundation is so deeply laid and broadly extended that it can include any sincere soul. Whereas other associations are exclusive, in effect if not in intention, and from method if not from ideal, Baha'i association is inclusive, shutting the gates of fellowship to no sincere  soul. In every gathering there is latent or developed some basis of selection. 

 In religion this basis is a creed limited by the historical nature of its origin; in politics this is party or platform; in economics this is a mutual misfortune or mutual power; in the arts and sciences this basis consists of special training or activity or interest. 

 In all these matters, the more exclusive the basis of selection, the stronger the move-ncwnt  — a condition diametrically opposed to that existing in the Baha'i Cause. Hence the Cause, for all its spirit of growth and progress, develops siowiy as regards the numbers  of its active adherents. For people are accustomed to exclusiveness and division  in all affairs. 

 The important sanctions have ever been warrants and justifications of division. 

 To enter the Baha'i religion is to leave these sanctions behind — an experience  which at first invariably exposes one to new trials and sufferings, as the human  ego revolts against the supreme sanction of universal love. The scientific must associate with the simple and unlearned, the rich with the poor, the white with the colored, the mystic with the literalist, the Christian with the Jew, the Muslim with the Parsee: and on terms removing the advantage of long established presumptions and privileges. 

 But for this difficult experience there are glorious compensations. Let us remember that art grows sterile as it turns away from the common humanity, that philosophy likewise loses its vision when developed in solitude, and that politics and religion never succeed apart from the general needs of mankind. Human nature is not yet known, for we have all lived in a state of mental, moral, emotional or social defense, and the psychology of defense is the psychology of inhibition. But the love of God removes


<p183>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH            183

  fear; the removal of fear establishes the latent powers, and association with others in spiritual love brings these powers into vital, positive expression. 

 A Baha'i community  is a gathering where this process can take place in this age, siowiy at first, as the new impetus gathers force, more rapidly as the members become conscious of the powers unfolding the flower of unity among men. 

 Where the community is small and insignificant, in comparison with the population of the city or town, the first condition of growth is understanding of the Manifestation of Baha'u'llah, and the next condition is that of true humility. If these two conditions exist, the weakest soul becomes en-ciowed  with effective power in service to the Cause. The result of unity, in fact, is to share the powers and faculties of all with each. 

 The responsibility for and supervision of Local Baha'i affairs is vested in a body known as the Spiritual Assembly. This body (limited to nine members) is elected annually on April 21st, the first day of Ridy ~in (the Festival commemorating the Declaration of Baha'u'llah) by the adult declared believers of the community, the voting list being drawn up by the outgoing Spiritual 

Assembly. Concerning       

 the character  and fuActions of this body, cAbdut. BaM has written as follows: tcIt is incumbent upon everyone (every believer) not to take any step (of Baha'i activity) without consulting the Spiritual Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with heart and soui its bidding and be submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well arranged. Otherwise every person will act independently and, after his own judgment, will follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause. 

 "The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance  of spirit, detachment from all cisc save God, attraction to His divine fragrance,  humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and longsuffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Bah4 shall be vouchsafed safed to them. In this day, Assemblies of consultation arc of the greatest importance and a vital necessity. Obedience unto them is essential and obligatory. The members thereof must take counsci together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresses with absolute freedom  his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. 

 Should anyQne oppose, he must on no account feel hurt, for not until matters  are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. 

 The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If after discussion a decision be carried unanimously, well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices must prevail. 

 t~Th first condition is absolute iove and harmony amongst the members of the Assembly.  They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves  the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. 

 Should harmony of thought and absolute  unity be nonexistent, that gathering shall be dispersed and that Assembly be brought to naught. 

 "The second condition: They must when coming together turn their faces to the Kingdom on high and ask aid from the realm of Glory. Discussions must all be confined to spiritual matters that pertain to the training of souis, the instruction of children, the relief of the poor, the help of the feeble throughout all classes in the world, kindness to all peoples, the diffusion of the fragrances of God and the exaltation of 

His Holy Word. Should      

 they endeavor to fulfil these conditions the grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them and that Assembly shall become the center of the divine blessings, and hosts of divine confirmation shall come to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of spirit." 

 The letters of Shoghi Effendi quote the fundamental instructions contained in the writings of Baha'u'llah and CAbd 'lBh' on the character of Baha'i administration, and


<p184>
184              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  give them definite application: "A careful study of Baha'u'llah's and tAbdu'1-BaM's Tablets will reveal that other duties (besides teaching the Cause), no less vital to the interests  of the Cause, devolve upon the elected representatives of the friends in every locality. 

 '~They must endeavor to promote amity and concord amongst the friends and secure an active and wholehearted cooperation for the service of the Cause. 

 "They must do their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to the poor, the sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective of color, caste and creed. 

 (cThey must promote by every means in their power the material as well as spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of children; institute, whenever possible, Baha educational institutions; organize  and supervise their work, and provide the best means for their progress and development. 

 ccThey must bend every effort to promote the interests of the Mashriqu'1 — Adhkir (that is, House of Worship) 1 and hasten the day when the work of this glorioss Edifice2 will have been consummated. 

 !cThey must encourage and stimulate by every means at their command, through subscriptions, reports and articles, the development  of the various Baha'i magazines. 

 ttThey must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the friends, the feasts and anniversaries, as well as the special gatherings designed to serve and promote  the social, intellectual and spiritual interests of their fellowmen. 

 "They must supervise in these days when the cause is still in its infancy all Baha'i publications and translations, and provide in general for a dignified and accurate presentation  of all Baha'i literature and its distribution to the general public. 

 tcThese rank among the most outstanding obligations of the members of every 

Spiritual  Assembly. In   

 whatever locality the Cause has sufficiently expanded, and in order to insure efficiency and avoid confusion, each of these manifold functions 1 Referring particularly to Spiritual Assemblies in America. 
     2 On the shore of Lake     

Michigan.                  

 will have to be referred to a special Committee, responsible to that Assembly, elected by it from among the friends in that local-fry, and upon whose work the Assembly will have to exercise constant and general supervision. 

 CCIn every locality, be it city or hamlet, where the number of adult declared believers  exceed nine, a local Spiritual Assembly must be forthwith established. 

 (cAs the progress and extension of spiritual  activities is dependent and conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that immediately after the establishment  of local as well as national Spiritual Assemblies, a Baha'i Fund be established, to be placed under the exclusive control of the 

Spiritual Assembly. All    

 donations and contributions should be offered to the Treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of promoting the interests of the Cause throughout that locality or country. It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of Baha'u'llah,  who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely and generously for the increase of that Fund. The members of the Spiritual Assembly will at their own discretion expand it to promote the teaching  campaign, to help the needy, to establish educational Baha'i institutions, to extend  in every way their sphere of service. 

 ceNothing whatever should be given to the public by any individual among the friends, unless fully considered and approved by the Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and, if this (as is undoubtedly the case) is a matter that pertains to the general interests of the Cause in that land, then it is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration and approval  of the National Body representing all the various local Assemblies. 

 Not only with regard to publication, but all matters without any exception whatsoever, regarding  the interests of the Cause in that locality, individually or collectively, should be referred exclusively to the Spiritual Assembly in that locality, which shall decide upon it, unless it be a matter of national interest, in which case it shall be referred to the National 

(Baha'i) Body. With this National

 Body also will rest the decision


<p185>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 185

  whether a given question is of local or national interest. (By national affairs is not meant matters that are political in their character, for the friends of God the world over are strictly forbidden to meddle with political affairs in any way whatever, but rather things that affect the spiritual activities of the body of the friends in that land.) 

 "Full harmony, however, as well as cooperation among the various local Assemblies  and the members themselves, and particularly between each Assembly and the National Body is of the utmost importance, for upon it depends the unity of the Cause of God, the solidarity of the friends, the full, speedy and efficient working of the spiritual activities of His loved ones. 

 "The various Assemblies, local and national,  constitute today the bedrock upon the strength of which the 

Universal House (of Justice)

 is in future to be firmly established  and raised. 

 Not until these function vigorously and harmoniously can the hope for the termination of this period of transition be realized. Bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not dictatorial  authority, but humble fellowship; not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and loving consultation. 

 Nothing short of the spirit of a true Baha'i can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the right of the individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand, and fellowship,  candor, and courage on the other." 

 Experience in the life of a Baha'i community and participation in the details of its several activities impresses one with the fact that Baha'i unity has in it new elements  which work powerfully to expand one's area of sympathy, deepen one's insight, develop one's character and bring order and stability into all of one's affairs. 

 There can be no higher privilege than the experience of attempting to serve faithfully upon a Spiritual Assembly, conscious as its members  are of the unique standard upheld by ~Abdu'1 — Bah4 and bringing as it does the opportunity of dealing with a large range and diversity of human problems from an impersonal point of view. It is inevitable that the nine elected members shall exemplify diverse interests and types of character,  with the result that unity of heart and conscience with the other eight members  is a direct training to enter into spiritual unity with the larger body of mankind. No such schools of discipline and inspiration  exist on earth today, for one must bear in mind that a Baha'i community can never be an exclusive group nor a closed circle of interests but, on the contrary, its fundamental purpose is to unify and cooperate  with every possible element in the surrounding population. 

    The local Spiritual Assembly

 after election  organizes by electing from its own number a chairman, corresponding secretary, recording secretary and treasurer. It should appoint from its own members or from the local Baha'i community working committees responsible for the various permanent  activities of the Cause. 

  Since a Spiritual Assembly 

 is established upon a new and higher ideal, the character, knowledge and purity of its members is essential  to success. 

 Wherever personal ambition, narrowness or impurity enters a Spiritual  Assembly, the results are invariably to check the growth of the Cause and, if these conditions are prolonged, to destroy the foundation already laid. The careful student of the teachings will accept this result as one more vindication of the all-surround-ing spirit protecting this Faith. The elimination of an unworthy group from the Baha'i Cause would be a bitter disappointment but not an evidence that the Cause had failed. 

 On the contrary, the Cause could only be declared a failure if personal ambition, pride, narrowness and impurity should so prevail as to build a worldwide organization able to pervert the original purpose. 

    The local Spiritual Assemblies

 of a country  are linked together and coordinated through another elected body of nine members,  the 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 This body comes into being by means of an annual election held by elected delegates representing the local Baha'i communities. The delegates are elected by all the adult declared believers of a community in which a Spiritual Assembly exists. The National


<p186>
186             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Convention in which the delegates are gathered together is composed of an elective  body based upon the principle of proportional  representation. 

 The total number  of delegates is fixed by Shoghi Effendi for each country, and this number is fulfilled  by assigning to each local community the number of delegates called for by its relative numerical strength. These National Conventions are preferably held during the period of Ridvan, the twelve days beginning April 21, which commemorate the Declaration made by Baha'u'llah in the Garden of Ridvan near Baghd~d. 

 The recognition of delegates is vested in the outgoing 

National Spiritual Assembly.
     A National Convention      

 is an occasion for deepening one's understanding of Baha'i activities  and of sharing reports of national and local activities for the period of the elapsed year. It has been the custom to hold a public Baha Congress in connection with the Convention. The function of a Baha'i delegate is limited to the duration of the National Convention and participation in the election of the new National 

Spiritual  Assembly. While

 gathered together, the delegates are a consultative and advisory body whose recommendations are to be carefully considered by the members of the elected 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 Delegates unable to attend the Convention  in person are permitted to vote for the new National Spiritual Assembly by mail. 

 The relation of the National Spiritual Assembly  to the local Spiritual Assemblies and to the body of the believers in the country is thus defined in the letters of the Guardian  of the 

Cause:                     

 "Regarding the establishment of National Assemblies, it is of vital importance that in every country, where the conditions are f a-vorable  and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size —  that a National Spiritual Assembly be immediately established, representative of the friends throughout that country. 

 "Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate, by frequent personal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends as well as the local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the Cause in that country. 

 "It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as in the course of time it shall evolve into the 

National House of Justice  

 (referred to in tAbdu'1-BaM's Will as the cSecondary House of Justice') which according to the explicit text of the Testament will have, in conjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world, to elect directly the members of the International or Universal House of 

Justice, that Supreme      

 Council that will guide, organize and unify the affairs of the Movement throughout the world. 

 (cTbis National Spiritual Assembly which, pending the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, will have to be reelected once a year, obviously assumes grave responsibilities  for it has to exercise full authority  over all the local Assemblies in its province, and will have to direct the activities  of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in general. 

 ccVital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country, such as the matter  of translation and publication, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the teaching work, and other similar matters that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly. 

 ttlt will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local Assemblies, to a special committee, to be elected by the members of the National Spiritual Assembly from among all the friends in that country, which will bear to it the same relations as the local committees bear to their respective local Assemblies. 

 "With it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is strictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the consideration and decision of the local Assembly,  or whether it should fall under its own province and be a matter which ought to receive its special attention. 

 cdt is the bounden duty, in the interest of the Cause we all love and serve, of the members of the incoming National Assembly, once elected by the delegates at Convention time, to seek and have the utmost regard,


<p187>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 187

  individually as well as collectively, for. the advice, the considered opinion and the true sentiments of the assembled delegates. 

 Banishing  every vestige of secrecy, of undue reticence, of dictatorial aloofness from their midst, they should radiantly and abundantly unfold to the eyes of the delegates by whom they were elected, their plans, their hopes and their cares. They should familiarize the delegates with the various matters that will have to be considered in the current year, and calmly and conscientiously study and weigh the opinions and judgments of the delegates. 

 The newly elected National Assembly,  during the few days when the Convention is in session, and after the dispersion of the delegates, should seek ways and means to cultivate understanding, facilitate and maintain the exchange of views, deepen confidence, and vindicate by every tangible evidence their one desire to serve and advance  the common weal. 

 "The National Spiritual    

 Assembly, however,  in view of the unavoidable limitations imposed upon the convening of frequent and longstanding sessions of the Convention,  will have to retain in its hands the final decision on all matters that affect the interests of the Cause — such as the right to decide whether any local Assembly is functioning in accordance with the principles  laid down for the conduct and the advancement of the Cause. 

 t~The seating of delegates to the Convention  (that is, the right to decide upon the validity of the credentials of the delegates at a given Convention), is vested in the outgoing National Assembly, and the right to decide who has the voting privilege is also ultimately placed in the hands of the National Spiritual Assembly, either when a Local Spiritual Assembly is for the first time being formed in a given locality, or when differences arise between a new applicant and an already established local Assembly. 

 tt'Mere the National Spiritual Assembly to decide, after mature deliberation, to omit the holding of the Baha'i Convention and Congress in a given year, then they could, only in such a case, devise ways and means to insure that the annual election of the National Spiritual Assembly should be held by mail, provided it can be conducted with sufficient thoroughness, efficiency and dispatch. 

 It would also appear to me unobjectionable to enable and even to require in the last resort such delegates as cannot possibly undertake the journey to the seat of the Baha'i Convention to send their votes, for the election of the 

National Spiritual  Assembly
only, by mail to the       

National  Secretary."     

 Concerning the matter of drawing up the voting list to be used at the annual local Baha'i elections, the responsibility for this is placed upon each local Spiritual Assembly, and as a guidance in the matter the Guardian  has written the following: "To state very briefly and as adequately as present circumstances permit, the principal  factors that must be taken into consideration  before deciding whether a person may be regarded a true believer or not: Full recognition of the station of the 

Forerunner, the Author     

 and the True Exemplar of the Baha'i Cause, as set forth in ~ Will and Testament; unreserved acceptance of and submission to whatsoever has been revealed by their Pen; loyal and steadfast adherence to every clause of our Beloved's sacred Will; and close association with the spirit as well as the form of the presentday Baha'i administration — these I conceive to be the fundamental and primary considerations that must be fairly, discreetly and thoughtfully ascertained before reaching such a vital decision.~~ Abdu'l-Baha's instructions provide for the further development of Baha'i organization  through an International Spiritual Assembly to be elected by the members of the National 

Spiritual Assemblies.      

 This international body has not yet come into existence, but its special character has been clearly defined: ttAnd now, concerning the Assembly (Baytu~1~~CAd~1: that is, House of Justice) which God bath ordained as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. 

 Its members must be manifestations of the fear of God, and daysprings  of knowledge and understanding, must be steadfast in God's Faith, and the well-wishers of all mankind. By this Assembly  is meant the 

Universal Assembly:


<p188>
188              THE  BAHA'I  WORLD

  that is, in each country a secondary Assembly  must be instituted, and these secondary Assemblies must elect the members of the Universal one. 

 "Unto this body all things must be referred.  It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit  Holy Text. 

 By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved, and the Guardian of the Cause is its sacred head and the distinguished member, for life, of that body. 

 Should he not attend in person its deliberations, he must appoint one to represent him. This assembly enacteth the laws and the executive enforceth them. The legislative body must reinforce the executive,  the executive must aid and assist the legislative body, so that, through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the foundation of fairness and justice  may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the world may become even as Paradise itself. 

 ccUntO the Most Holy Book everyone must turn, and all that is not expressly recorded  therein must be referred to the Universal Assembly. That which this body, either unanimously or by a majority, doth carry, that is verily the truth and the purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant." 

 Even at the present time, the Baha'is in all parts of the world maintain an intimate and cordial association by means of regular correspondence and individual visits. 

 This contact of members of different races, nationalities and religious traditions is concrete  proof that the burden of prejudice and the historical factors of division can be entirely overcome through the spirit of oneness  established by Baha'u'llah. 

 The general student of religion will not fail to note four essential characteristics of Baha'i administration. The first is its completely  successful reconciliation of the usually  opposed claims of democratic freedom and unanswerable authority. 

 The second is the entire absence from the Baha'i Cause of anything approaching the institution of a salaried professional clergy. The Baha'i conception ception of religion i•s one which combines mysticism, which is a sacred personal experience,  with practical morality, which is a useful contact between the individual and his fellow man. In the nature of things, some souL are more advanced than others, and the function of spiritual teaching is given special importance in the writings of Baha'u'llah and CAbd~1Bh~ The Baha'i teacher, however, has no authority over the individual conscience. 

 The individual conscience must be subordinated to the decisions  of a duly elected Spiritual Assembly, but this relationship is entirely different in character and results from the relationship of an individual with minister or priest. 

 The third characteristic is the absence of internal factionalism, that bane of all organized  effort, and the sure sign of the presence of spiritual disease. 

 The predominant  spirit of unity which distinguishes the Baha'i Cause in its relation to the world, making its followers strive for reconciliation rather than partisan victory, creates an internal condition, unlike that which exists in movements whibh accept partisan victory, in one or another form, as their very reason for being. Such movements can but disintegrate from within; the Baha'i Order can but grow. 

 Significant also is the fourth characteristic, namely, that the Baha'i Cause has within it an inherent necessity operating slowly but surely to bring its administration  into the hands of those truly fitted for the nature of the work. 

 The lesser vision gives way invariably for the larger vision, itself replaced by the still larger vision in due time. The result is an inevitable improvement in the qualities placed at the service of the Cause, until the highest attributes of humanity will be enrolled. 

 In the Baha'i Cause we are actually witnessing the fulfilment of that strange and cryptic  saying, ttThe meek shall inherit the earth." 

 That the administrative machinery is not an end in itself but merely the means to spread everywhere the light of faith and brotherhood, is frequently expressed by the Guardian in his general letters, and this brief survey may well close with one of those passages:


<p189>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 189

 fCNot by the force of numbers, not by the mere exposition of a set of new and noble principles, not by an organized campaign of teaching — no matter how worldwide  and elaborate in its character — not even by the staunchness of our faith or the exaltati6n of our enthusiasm, can we ultimately  hope to vindicate in the eyes of a critical and skeptical age the supreme claim of the Abhd Revel ation. 

 One thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely the extent to which our own inner life and private character mirror forth in their manifold asftects the splendor of those eternal principles proclaimed by Baha'u'llah." 
                           
      A PROCEDURE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE LOCAL
                 SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY

  Adopted by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the 

              United States and Canada

       INTRODUCTION               

  tCA perusal of some of the words of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-Bahi on the duties and functions of the Spiritual Assemblies in every land (later to be designated as the local Houses of Justice), emphatically reveals the sacredness of their nature, the wide scope of their activity, and the grave responsibility which rests upon them." —  SHOGHI EFFENDI, March 5, 1922. 

  "The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number  of Bah4. 

 It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, 0 ye that perceive." — 

BAHA'I  'LLAH             

  "It is incumbent upon every one not to take any step without consulting the Spiritual  Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with heart and soui its bidding and be submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well arranged. Otherwise wise every person will act independently and after his own judgment, will follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause. 

 "The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance  of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrance, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and longsuffering in diflicul-ties  and servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be vouchsafed to them. In this day, Assemblies of consultation  are of the greatest importance and a vital necessity. 

 Obedience unto them is essential  and obligatory. 

 The members thereof  must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument.  Should any one oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. 

 The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions.  If, after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously, well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise a majority of voices must prevail. 

 ttTh first condition is absolute iove and harmony amongst the members of the Assembly.  They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in them


<p190>
190             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  selves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be nonexistent, that gathering  shall be dispersed and that Assembly be brought to naught. The second condition: —  They must when coming together turn their faces to the Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation to express their views. They must in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence  in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. The honored members must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion arise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to the majority. 

 It is again not permitted that any one of the honored members object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for such criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. 

 In short, whatsoever thing is arranged  in harmony and with love and purity of motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement prevail the re —  suit shall be darkness upon darkness. 

 If this be so regarded, that Assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to cooiness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One. Discussions must all be confined to spiritual matters that pertain to the training of souis, the instruction of children,  the relief of the poor, the help of the feeble throughout all classes in the world, kindness to all peoples, the diffusion of the fragrances of God and the exaltation of 

His Holy Word. Should     

 they endeavor to fulfil these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that Assembly shall become the center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their aid and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of ~ C(T1~e importance, nay the absolute necessity of these local Assemblies is manifest when we realize that in the days to come they will evolve into the local House of Justice, and at present provide the firm foundation on which the structure of the Master's 'Will is to be reared in future. 

 "In order to avoid division and disruption,  that the Cause may not fall a prey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its purity and pristine vigor, that its affairs may be conducted with efficiency and promptness, it is necessary that every one (that is, every member of the Baha'i community)  should conscientioudy take an active part in the election of these Assemblies,  abide by their decision, enforce their decree, and cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task of stimulating the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. 

 The members of these Assemblies. on their part, must disregard utterly their own likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and concentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce  to the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i community and promote the common  weal." — Snocnr EFFENDI, March 12, 1923. 

 "Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated  assurance that every Assembly elected in that rarified atmosphere of selflessness  and detachment is, in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and with cheerfulness.

 Assembly, and all members of the local Baha'i community, shall be guided and controlled by the provisions of those 

ByLaws.                   
                           
        II.          MEETINGS OF THE LOCAL
SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY         

  In addition to its observance of the general  functions vested in the institution of a Spiritual Assembly, each Spiritual Assembly has need of a procedure for the conduct of its meetings. 

 The following items represent the outline of the parliamentary rules of procedure which the National Spiritual Assembly  has adopted and recommends to each and every local Spiritual Assembly throughout  the 

United States and Canada.  
                           
Calling of Meetings        

  A meeting of the Spiritual Assembly is valid oniy when it has been duly called, that is, when each and every member has been informed of the time and place. The general practice is for the Assembly to decide upon some regular time and place for its meetings throughout the Baha'i year, and this decision when recorded in the Minutes is sufficient notice to the members. 

 When the regular schedule cannot be followed, or the need arises for a special meeting, the secretary, on request by the chairman or any three inembers of the Spiritual Assembly, should send due notice to all the members. 
                           
Order of Business          

  Roll call by the Secretary (or Recording Secretary). 

  Prayer.                    

 Reading and approval of Minutes of previous meetings. 

 Report of Secretary (or Corresponding Secretary), including presentation of letters received by the Assembly since its last meeting, and of any and all recommendations duly adopted by the community at the last Nineteen 

Day Feast.                 
  Report of Treasurer.       
  Report of Committees.      
  Unfinished business.       

 New business, including conferences with members of the community and with applicants for enrollment as members of the community. 

        Closing Prayer.            
                           
Conduct of Business        

  A Spiritual Assembly, in maintaining its threefold function of a body given (within the limits of its jurisdiction) an executive, a legislative and a judicial capacity, is charged with responsibility for initiating action and making decisions. 

 Its meetings, therefore, revolve around various definite matters which require deliberation and collective  decision, and it is incumbent upon the members, one and all, to address themselves to the subject under discussion and not engage in general speeches of an irrelevant  character. 

 Every subject or problem before an Assembly  is most efficiently handled when the following process is observed: first, ascertainment and agreement upon the facts; second, agreement upon the spiritual or administrative Teachings which the question involves; third, full and frank discussion of the matter, leading up to the offering of a resolution; and fourth, voting upon the resolution. 

 A resolution, or motion, is not subject to discussion or vote until duly made and seconded. It is preferable to have each resolution clear and complete in itself, but when an amendment is duly made and seconded, the chairman shall call for a vote on the amendment first and then on the original motion. An amendment must be relevant to, and not contravene, the subject matter of the motion. 

 The chairman, or other presiding officer, has the same power and responsibility for discussion and voting upon motions as other members of the Assembly. 

 Discussion of any matter before the Assembly  may be terminated by a motion duly made, seconded and voted calling upon the chairman to put the matter to a vote or to proceed to the next matter on the agenda. The purpose of this procedure is to prevent any member or members from prolonging the discussion beyond the point at which full opportunity has been given all members to express their views. 

 'When the Assembly has taken action


<p192>
192             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  upon any matter, the action is binding upon all members, whether present or absent from the meeting at which the action was taken. Individual views and opinions must be subordinated  to the will of the Assembly when a decision has been made. A Spiritual Assembly is an administrative unit, as it is a spiritual unit, and therefore no distinction between ttmajority~~ and "minority" groups or factions can be recognized. 

 Each member  must give undivided loyalty to the institution to which he or she has been elected. 

 Any action taken by the Assembly can be reconsidered at a later meeting, on motion  duly made, seconded and carried. This reconsideration, according to the result of the consultation, may lead to a revision or the annulment of the prior action. If a majority is unwilling to reconsider the prior action, further discussion of the matter by any member is improper. 

 The Assembly has a responsibility in filling  a vacancy caused by the inability of any member to attend the meetings. "It is only too obvious that unless a member can attend regularly the meetings of his local Assembly,  it would be impossible for him to discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfil his responsibilities as a representative  of the community. Membership in a local Spiritual Assembly carries with it, indeed, the obligation and capacity to remain  in close touch with Local Baha'i activities, and ability to attend regularly the sessions of the Assembly." — SHOGHI EFFENDI, January 27, 1935. 

 The Spiritual Assembly, as a permanent body, is responsible for maintaining all its records, including Minutes of meetings, correspondence  and financial records, throughout  its existence as a Baha'i institution. Each officer, therefore, on completing his or her term of office, shall turn over to the Assembly all records pertaining to the business  of the 

Assembly.                 
                          
III. CONSULTATION WITH    
THE                       
                          
        COMMUNITY                 

  A.  The institution of the Nineteenth Day Feast provides the recognized and regular occasion for genera] consultation on the part of the community, and for consulta tion between the Spiritual Assembly and the members of the community. The conduct of the period of consultation at Nineteen Day Feasts is a vital function of each Spiritual  Assembly. 
   From Words of tAbdu~1~BaM,

"The Nineteen Day Feast   

 was inaugurated by the BTh and ratified by Baha'u'llah, in His Holy Book, the Aqdas, so that people may gather together and outwardly show fel —  lowship and love, that the Divine mysteries may be disclosed. 

 The object is concord, that through this fellowship hearts may become  perfectly united, and reciprocity and mutual helpfulness be established. Because the members of the world of humanity are unable to exist without being banded together,  cooperation and helpfulness is the basis of human society. Without the realization  of these two great principles no great movement is pressed forward." London,  England, December 29, 1912. (Quoted in BAHA'I NEWS No. 33.) 
                          
     The Nineteen Day Feasi    

 has been described  by the Guardian as the foundation of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 It is to be conducted according to the following program: the first part, entirely spiritual in character, is devoted to readings from Baha'i Sacred 'Writings; the second part consists of general consultation on the affairs of the Cause. The third part is the material feast and social meeting of all the believers, and should maintain the spiritual nature of the Feast. 

 Baha'is should regard this Feast as the very heart of their spiritual activity, their participation in the mystery of the Holy Utterance, their steadfast unity one with another in a universality raised high above the limitations of race, class, nationality, sect, and personality, and their privilege of contributing to the power of the Cause in the realm of collective action.

     The Spiritual Assembly     

 is responsible for the holding of the Nineteen 

Day Feast. If the Baha'i   

 calendar for some adequate reason  cannot be observed, the Assembly may arrange to hold a Feast at the nearest possible  date. 

 Only members of the Baha'i community, and visiting Baha'is from other communities, may attend these meetings, but young people of less than twenty-one years of age, who have studied the Teachings and declared their intention of joining the community  on reaching the age of twenty-one, may also attend. 

 Regular attendance at the Nineteen Day Feast is incumbent upon every Baha'i, illness  or absence from the city being the only justification for absence. Believers are expected  to arrange their personal affairs so as to enable them to observe the Baha'i calendar. 

  Order of Business for the 

Consultation Period        

  The chairman or other appointed representative of the Spiritual Assembly presides during the period of consultation. 

    The Spiritual Assembly     

 reports to the community whatever communications have been received from the Guardian and the National Spiritual Assembly, and provides opportunity for general discussion. 

 The Assembly likewise reports its own activities and plans, including committee appointments that may have been made since the last Feast, the financial report, arrangements made for public meetings, and in general share with the community all matters that concern the Faith. 

 These reports  are to be followed by general consultation. 

 A matter of vital importance at this meeting is consideration of national and international Baha'i affairs, to strengthen the capacity of the community to cooperate in promotion of the larger Baha'i interests and to deepen the understanding of all believers  concerning the relation of the local community to the Baha'i World Community. 

 Individual Baha'is are to find in the Nineteen Day Feast the channel through which to make suggestions and recommen dations to the National 

Spiritual Assembly. These  

 recommendations are offered first to the local community, and when adopted by the community come before the local Assembly,  which then may in its discretion forward the recommendation to the National  Spiritual Assembly accompanied by its own considered view. 

 Provision is to be made for reports from committees, with discussion of each report. Finally, the meeting is to be open for suggestions and recommendations from individual  believers on any matter affecting the Cause. 

 The local Baha'i community may adopt by majority vote any resolution which it wishes collectively to record as its advice and recommendation to the 

Spiritual Assembly.       

 Upon each member of the community lies the obligation to make his or her utmost contribution to the consultation, the ideal being a gathering of Baha inspired with one spirit and concentrating upon the one aim to further the interests of the 

Faith.                     

 The Secretary of the Assembly records each resolution adopted by the community, as well as the various suggestions advanced during the meeting, in order to report these to the Spiritual Assembly for its consideration. 

 'Whatever action the Assembly takes is to be reported at a later Nineteen 

Day Feast.                 

 Matters of a personal nature should be brought before the Spiritual Assembly and not to the community at the Nineteen 

Day Feast. Concerning      

 the attitude with which believers should come to these Feasts, the Master has said, CCYOU must free yourselves from everything that is in your hearts, before  you enter." (Baha'i News Letter of the N. S. A. of Germany and Austria, December, 1934.) 

 B.    The Annual Meeting on April 21, called for the election of the Spiritual Assembly,  provides the occasion for the presentation of annual reports by the Assembly and by all its Committees. 

 The chairman of the outgoing Assembly presides at this meeting. 

 The order of Business includes: Reading of the call of the meeting, reading of appropriate Baha'i passages bearing upon the


<p194>
194              THE BAHA'I WORLD

 subject of the election, appointment of tellers, distribution of ballots, prayers for the spiritual guidance of the voters, the election,  presentation of annual reports, tellers' report of the election, approval of the tellers'  report. 

 C.  The Annual Meeting for the election of Convention delegate (or delegates) is likewise  presided over by the Assembly chairman,  and except for the annual reports the Order of Business is similar to that observed at the meeting held each April 21. It is preferable for the Spiritual Assembly to arrange a special meeting for the election of delegates, and not hold this election during the consultation period of a Nineteen 

Day Feast.                 

 D.   In addition to these occasions for general consultation, the Spiritual Assembly is to give consultation to individual believers whenever requested. 

 During such consultation with individual believers, the Assembly should observe the following principles: the impartiality of each of its members with respect to all matters  under discussion; the freedom of the individual Baha'i to express his views, feelings  and recommendations on any matter affecting the interests of the Cause, the confidential character of this consultation, and the principle that the Spiritual Assembly does not adopt any resolution or make any final decision, until the party or parties have withdrawn from the meeting. 

 Appeals from decisions of a local Spiritual Assembly are provided for in the ByLaws  and the procedure fully described in a statement published in BAT-L&'i NEWS, February, 1933. 

 When confronted with evidences of unhappiness, whether directed against the Assembly or against members of the community,  the Spiritual Assembly should realize that its relationship to the believers is not merely that of a formal constitutional body but also that of a spiritual institution called upon to manifest the attributes of courtesy, patience and loving insight. 

 Many conditions are not to be remedied by the exercise of power and authority but rather by a sympathetic understanding of the sources of the difficulty in the hearts of the friends. 

 As cAbdu~1~BahA has explained, some of the people are children and must be trained, some are ignorant and must be educated,  some are sick and must be healed. Where, however, the problem is not of this order but represents flagrant disobedience and disloyalty to the Cause itself, in that case the Assembly should consult with the National Spiritual Assembly concerning the necessity for disciplinary action. 

 Members of the Baha'i community, for their part, should do their utmost by prayer and meditation to remain always in a positive  and joyous spiritual condition, bearing in mind the Tablets which call upon Baha'is to serve the world of humanity and not waste their precious energies in negative complaints. 

  IV.          BAHA'I ANNIVERSARIES, 

FESTIVALS AND DAYS OF      
FASTING                    

  The Spiritual Assembly, among its various  duties and responsibilities, will provide for the general observance by the local community  of the following

             THE ANNUAL BAHA CONVENTION

   A Statement by the National Spiritual Assembly

 (Approved by the Guardian) Despite the repeated explanations given by the Guardian on this subject, there seems to exist each year, prior to and also during the Convention period, some misunderstanding  as to the nature of the Annual 

Meeting.                   

 In order to establish a definite standard of Convention procedure, the following statement has been approved and adopted, and in accordance with the vote taken by the National Assembly, a copy of the statement is placed in the hands of the presiding officer of the Convention to control the Convention procedure, after being read to the delegates by the officer of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 by whom the Convention is convened.1 

 ccThe delegates present at this Annual Baha'i Convention are called upon to render a unique, a vital service to the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.      

 Their collective functions and responsibilities are not a matter of arbitrary opinion, but have been clearly described by the Guardian of the Cause. If civil governments  have found it necessary to adopt the doctrine that tignorance of the law is no excuse,' how much more essential it is for Baha'is, individually and collectively, to base their responsible actions upon thorough comprehension of the fundamental princi-pies which underlie that Administrative Order which in its maturity is destined to become the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 CCC idrble confusion would have been avoided at Conventions held during the past three years had the delegates, and all members  of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 itself,  given sufficient consideration to the fact that BAHA'I Nrws of February, 1930, contained an explanation of the Annual Convention which had been prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly, submitted to Shoghi Effendi, and definitely approved by him. It is because this statement of four years ago has gone unnoticed that successive II     This reference to '%eing read to the delegates" was in connection with the 

1934 Convention only. The  

 statement is here published for the general information of the believers. 

 Conventions, acting upon some matters as a law unto themselves, have inadvertently contravened the Guardian's clear instructions. 

 ccThe National Spiritual Assembly now calls attention to two specific portions of the 1930 statement approved by the Guardian which have been neglected in subsequent Conventions: first, the ruling that non-delegates  do not possess the right to participate  in Convention proceedings; and, second, that the time of the election of members of the National Spiritual Assembly shall be fixed in the Agenda at such a time as to allow the outgoing Assembly full time to report to the delegates, and to allow the rnconiing Assembly to have f till consultation with the assembled delegates. 

 It is surely evident that a procedure or principle of action once authorized by the Guardian is not subject to alteration by any Baha'i body or individual believer to whom the procedure directly applies. 

 "In order to remove other sources of misunderstanding, the National Spiritual Assembly  now feels it advisable to point out that the Guardian's letters on the subject of the Convention, received and published in BAHA'I Nrws this year,' do not, as some believers seem to feel, organically change the character and function of the Annual Meeting, but reaffirm and strengthen instructions  and explanations previously given. In the light of all the Guardian's references to this subject, compiled and published by the National Spiritual Assembly  in BAHA'I NEWS of November, 1933 and February, 1934, the following brief summary has been prepared and is now issued with the soic purpose of contributing to the spiritual unity of the chosen delegates here present: — 

    ~     The Annual Baha'i Convention

 has two unique functions to fulfill, discussion of current Baha'i matters and the election of the 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 The discussion should be free and untrammeled, 'February, 1934.


<p196>
196              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the election carried on in that spirit of prayer and meditation in which alone every delegate can render obedience to the Guardian  s expressed wish. 

 After the Convention is convened by the Chairman of the National  Spiritual Assembly, and after the roll call is read by the Secretary of the Assembly, the Convention proceeds to the election of its chairman and secretary by secret ballot  and without advance nomination, according to the standard set for all Baha'i elections. 

 "2. Non-delegates may not participate in Convention discussion. All members of the National Spiritual Assembly may participate in the discussion, but oniy those members who have been elected delegates may vote on any matter brought up for vote during the proceedings. 

    3.     The outgoing National

 Spiritual Assembly  is responsible for rendering reports of its own activities and of those carried on by its committees during the past year. The annual election is to be held at a point midway  during the Convention sessions, so that the incoming Assembly may consult with the delegates. 

 tC4 The Convention is free to discuss any Baha matter, in addition to those treated in the annual reports. 

 The Convention  is responsible for making its own rules of procedure controlling discussion; for example, concerning any limitations the delegates may find it necessary to impose upon the time allotted to or claimed by any one delegate. 

The National Assembly      

 will maintain the rights of the delegates to confer freely and fully, free from any restricted  pressure, in the exercise of their function. 

 cc~• The Convention as an organic body is limited to the actual Convention period. It has no function to discharge after the close of the sessions except that of electing a member or members to fill any vacancy that might arise in the membership of the National Spiritual Assembly during the year. 

 ~     The Convention while in session has no independent legislative, executive or judicial  function. 

 Aside from its action in electing the National Spiritual Assembly, its discussions do not represent actions but recommendations which shall, according to the Guardian's instructions, be given conscientious  consideration by the National Assembly. 

   7. The National Spiritual  

 Assembly is the supreme Baha'i administrative body within the American Baha community, and its jurisdiction continues without interruption  during the Convention period as during the remainder of the year, and independently of the individuals composing its membership. Any matter requiring action of legislative, executive or judicial nature, whether arising during the Convention pe-nod  or at any other time, is to be referred to the National Spiritual 

Assembly. The National     

 Assembly is responsible for upholding  the administrative principles applying  to the holding of the Annual Convention as it is for upholding all other administrative principles. If, therefore, a Convention departs from the principles laid down for Conventions by the Guardian, and exceeds the limitations of function conferred upon it, in that case, and in that case alone, the National Spiritual Assembly can and must intervene. 

 It is the National Spiritual Assembly, and nor the Convention, which is authorized to decide when and why such intervention is required. 

     CC 8. The National Spiritual

 Assembly feels that it owes a real duty to the delegates,  and to the entire body of believers, in presenting any and all facts that may be required in order to clarify matters discussed  at the Convention. 

 There can be no true Baha consultation at this important meeting if any incomplete or erroneous view should prevail. 

   "9. The National Assembly  

 in adopting and issuing this statement does so in the sincere effort to assure the constitutional freedom of the Convention to fulfill its high mission. The path of true freedom lies in knowing and obeying the general principles given to all Baha'is for the proper conduct of their collective affairs. While the entire world plunges forward to destruction,  it is the responsibility of the National Spiritual Assembly to uphold that Order on which peace and security solely depends."

      THE NONPOLITICAL CHARACTER OF THE BAHA'I FAITH

  A Statement Prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly in Response to the Request for Clarification of the Subject Voiced by the 1933 Annual Convention It is the view of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 that the Guardian's references to the nonpolitical character of the Baha'i Faith, when studied as a whole, are so clear that they can be fully grasped by all believers  and rightly applied by all Local 

Spiritual  Assemblies     

 to any problems they may encounter. Should special circumstances arise, however, the National Assembly will make every effort to assist any Local Assembly  to arrive at fuller understanding of this important subject. 

 The first reference to consider is taken from the letter written by 

Shoghi Effendi on March    

 21, 1932, published under the title of "The Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah." 

 ~~]j feel it, therefore, incumbent upon me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance of an instruction which, at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or to the "West. 

 And this principle is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively  as local or national Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 "Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective nations,  with the policies of their governments and the schemes and programs of parties and factions. 

 In such controversies they should assign no blame, take no side, further no design, and identify themselves with no system prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide Fellowship which it is their aim to guard and foster. 

 Let them beware lest they allow themselves to become the tools of unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious among their countrymen. 

 Let them so shape their lives and regulate their conduct that no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery or of intimidation  may, however ill-founded, be brought against them. 

 It is their duty to strive to distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts ~nd functions as are either diplomatic or political,  from those that are purely administrative in character, and which under no circumstances are affected by the changes and chances that political activities and party government, in every land, must necessarily involve. Let them affirm their unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of thc politician, and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates 

God's immutable Purpose    
for all men.               

 "Let them proclaim that in whatever country they reside, and however advanced their institutions, or profound their desire to enforce the laws and apply the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, they will, unhesitatingly, subordinate the operation of such laws and the application of such principles to the requirements and legal enactments of their respective governments. 

 Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct  and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country's constitution, much less to allow the machinery  of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries." 

 This instruction raised the question whether believers should vote in any public election. A Tablet revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to Mr. Thornton Chase was sent to the Guardian, and the following  reply was received, dated January 26, 1933: ttThe Guardian fully recognizes the authenticity  and controlling influence of this


<p198>
198              THE BAJIAJIf WORLD

 instruction from eAbdu~1.~Bahi upon the question. He, however, feels under the responsibility of stating that the attitude taken by the Master (that is, that American citizens are in duty bound to vote in public elections) implies certain reservations. 

 He, therefore, lays it upon the individual conscience to see that in following the Master's instructions no Baha'i vote for an officer nor Baha'i participation in the affairs of the Republic shall involve acceptance by that individual of a program or policy that contravenes  any vital principle, spiritual or social, of the Faith." The Guardian added to this letter the following postscript: ccj feel it incumbent upon me to clarify the above statement, written in my behalf, by stating that no vote cast, or office undertaken,  by a Baha'i should necessarily constitute acceptance, by the voter or office holder, of the entire program of any political  party. No Baha'i can be regarded as either a Republican or Democrat, as such. He is, above all cisc, the supporter of the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, with which, I am firmly convinced, the program of no political party is completely bar-monious. 

 In a letter dated March 16, 1933, the Guardian sent these further details: CtAS regards the nonpolitical character of the Baha'i 

Faith, Shoghi Effendi      

 feels that there is no contradiction whatsoever between the Tablet (to Thornton Chase, referred to above) and the reservations to which he has referred. The Master surely never desired the friends to use their influence towards the realization and promotion of policies contrary to any of the principles of the Faith. 

 The friends may vote, if they can do it, without identifying themselves with one party or another. 

 To enter the arena of party politics is surely detrimental to the best interests of the Faith and will harm the Cause. It remains for the individuals  to so use their right to vote as to keep aloof from party politics, and always bear in mind that they are voting on the merits of the individual, rather than because he belongs to one party or another. 

 The matter must be made perfectly clear to the individuals, who will be left free to exercise their discretion and judgment. But if a certain person does enter into party politics and labors for the ascendency of one party over another, and continues to do it against the expressed appeals and warnings of the Assembly, then the Assembly has the right to refuse him the right to vote in Baha'i elections.~~ 

    CONCERNING MEMBERSHIP IN NONBAHA'I RELIGIOUS
                    ORGANIZATIONS

  The instruction written by Shoghi Effendi  concerning membership in nonBahA'i religious organizations, published in the July, 1935, number of BAHA'I NEWS, has brought forth some interesting and important communications from local Spiritual Assemblies and also from individual believers, to all of which the National Spiritual Assembly has given careful and sympathetic attention. 

   The National Assembly      

 itself, on receiving that instruction, made it the subject of extensive consultation, feeling exceedingly responsible for its own understanding of the Guardian's words and anxious to contribute to the understanding of the friends. 

 In October, 1935, the Assembly sent in reply to some of these communications a general letter embodying its thoughts on the subject, and a copy of that letter was forwarded to Shoghi Effendi for his approval and comment. 

 His references to its contents,  made in. letters addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly on 

November 29 and December   

 11, 1935, are appended to this statement. 

  Now that Shoghi Effendi's  

 approval has been received, the National Assembly feels it desirable to publish, for the information of all the American believers, the substance of the October letter. 

 While so fundamental an instruction is bound to raise different questions corresponding  to the different conditions existing throughout the Baha'i community, the most important consideration is our collective  need to grasp the essential principle


<p199>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 199

  underlying the new instruction, and our capacity to perceive that the position which the Guardian wishes us to take in regard to church membership is a necessary and inevitable  result of the steady development of the World Order of 

Baha'u'llah.                

 This essential principle is made clear when we turn to Shoghi Effendi's further reference  to the subject as published in BAHA'I NEWS for October, 1935 — words written by the Guardian's own hand. 

 In the light of these words, it seems fully evident that the way to approach this instruction  is in realizing the Faith of Baha'u'llah  as an ever-growing organism destined  to become something new and greater than any of the revealed religions of the past. Whereas former raiths inspired hearts and illumined souls, they eventuated in formal religions with an ecclesiastical or —  ganization, creeds, rituals and churches, while the Faith of Baha'u'llah, likewise renewing man's spiritual life, will gradually produce the institutions of an ordered society,  fulfilling not merely the function of the churches of the past but also the func-don of the civil state. By this manifesta-. don of the Divine Will in a higher degree than in former ages, humanity will emerge from that immature civilization in which church and state are separate and competitive institutions, and partake of a true civilization in which spiritual and social principles are at last reconciled as two aspects of one and the same Truth. 

 No Baha'i can read the successive 'XJorld Order letters sent us by Shoghi Effendi without perceiving that the Guardian, for many years, has been preparing us to understand  and appreciate this fundamental purpose  and mission of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah's. 

 Even when the Master ascended, we were for the most part still considering the Baha'i Faith as though it were oniy the "return of Christ" and failing to perceive the entirely new and larger elements latent in the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 Thus, in the very first of the World Order letters, written February 27th, 1929, Shoghi Effendi said: "Who, I may ask, when viewing the international character of the Cause, its far-flung ramifications, the increasing complexity of its affairs, the diversity versity of its adherents, and the state of confusion that assails on every side the infant Faith of God, can for a moment question the necessity of some sort of ad. ministrative machinery that will insure, amid the storm and stress of a struggling civilization, the unity of the Faith, the preservation  of its identity, and the protection of its interests?" 

 Although for five years the Guardian had been setting forth the principles of Baha'i Administration in frequent letters, in 1927 he apparently felt it necessary to overcome some doubts here and there as to the validity of the institutions the Master bequeathed to the Baha'is in His Will and Testament. The series of W'orld Order letters, however, goes far beyond the point of defending and explaining  their validity as an essential element  in the Faith of Baha'u'llah — the Guardian vastly extended the horizon of our understanding by making it clear that the Administrative Order, in its full development, is to be the social structure of the future civilization. 

 Thus, in that same letter quoted above, he wrote: "Not only will the presentday Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future, but will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion  of an independent and Sovereign Power. 

 And as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the peopies of East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the 

Universal House of Justice 

 attain the plenitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's future super-state." 

 This passage stands as the keystone in the noble structure which Shoghi Effendi has raised in his function as interpreter of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 The Master developed the Cause to the point where this social Teaching, always existent in the Tablets  of Baha'u'llah, could be explained to the believers and given its due significance as


<p200>
200             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the fulfilment of Baha'i evolution. As the Guardian expressed it: "That Divine Civilization,  the establishment of which is the primary mission of the Baha'i Faith." (World Order of Baha'u'llah, pages 3 and 4.) 

 For us these words mean that a Baha' i is not merely a member of a revealed Religion, be is also a citizen in a 'World Order even though that Order today is still in its infancy  and still obscured by the shadows thrown by the institutions, habits and attitudes derived from the past. 

 But since the aim and end has been made known, our devotion and loyalty must surely express itself, not in clinging to views and thoughts emanating from the past, but in pressing forward in response to the needs of the new creation. 

 That true devotion, which consists in conscious knowledge of the "primary mission,"  and unified action to assist in bringing about its complete triumph, recognizes that a BaJA'i today must have singleness of mind as of aim, without the division arising when we stand with one foot in the Cause and one foot in the world, attempting to reconcile diverse elements which the Manifestation of God Himself has declared to be irreconcilable. 

 The principle underlying the Guardian instruction about membership in nonBahA'i religious bodies has already been emphasized by Shoghi Effendi in another connection —  the instruction about the nonpolitical char-acted of the Faith which he incorporated in his letter entitled "The Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah." 

 For example: ~ feel it, therefore, incumbent upon me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance of an instruction which, at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or to the West. And this principle is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents  of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as local or national Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government." 

 Again, when the question was raised as to membership in certain nonBahA'i organizations  not directly religious or political in character, the Guardian replied: (cRegarding association with the World Fellowship of Faiths and kindred Societies, Shoghi Effendi wishes to reaffirm and elucidate the general principle that Baha'i elected representatives as well as individuals should refrain from any act or word that would imply a departure  from the principles, whether spiritual, social or administrative, established by Ba —  hA'u'lUh. rormal affiliation with and acceptance  of membership in organizations whose programs or policies are not wholly reconcilable with the Teachings is of course out of the question." 

 (BAHA'I NEWS, August, 1933.) 

 Thus, not once but repeatedly the Guardian  has upheld the vital principle underlying every type of relationship between Baha'is and other organizations, namely, that the Cause of Baha'u'llah is an ever-growing organism, and as we begin to realize its universality our responsibility is definitely established to cherish and defend that universality  from all compromise, all admixture with worldly elements, whether emanating from our own habits rooted in the past or from the deliberate attacks imposed by enemies from without. 

 It will be noted that in the instruction published in July, 1935, BAHA'I NEWS, the Guardian made it clear that the principle involved is not new and unexpected, but rather an application of an established principle to a new condition. "Concerning membership in nonBahA'i religious associations,  the Guardian wishes to reemphasize the general principle already laid down in his communications to your Assembly and also to the individual believers that no Baha'i who wishes to be a wholehearted and sincere upholder of the distinguishing principles of the Cause can accept full membership in any non-Bah&'i ecclesiastical organization. 

 For  it is only too obvious  that in most of its fundamental assumptions the Cause of Baha'u'llah is completely at variance with outworn creeds, ceremonies and institutions. During the days of the Master the Cause was still in a stage that made such an open and sharp


<p201>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                          201

  dissociation between it and other religious organizations, and particularly the Muslim Faith, not oniy inadvisable but practically impossible to establish. But since His passing  events throughout the Baha'i world, and particularly in Egypt where the Muslim  religious courts have formally testified to the independent character of the Faith, have developed to a point that has made such an assertion of the independence of the Cause not oniy highly desirable but absolutely essential." 

 To turn now to the Guardian's words published in October BAHA'I NEWS: "The separation that has set in between the institutions  of the Baha'i Faith and the IslAmic ecclesiastical organizations that oppose it imposes upon every loyal upholder of the Cause the obligation of refraining  from any word or action that might prejudice the position which our enemies have of their own accord proclaimed and established. This historic development, the beginnings of which could neither be recognized nor even anticipated in the years immediately preceding 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, may be said to have signalized  the Formative Period of our Faith and to have paved the way for the consolidation of its administrative order. 

 Though our Cause unreservedly recognizes the Divine origin of all the religions that preceded it and upholds the spiritual truths which lie at their very core and are common  to them all, its institutions, whether administrative, religious or humanitarian, must, if their distinctive character is to be maintained and recognized, be increasingly divorced from the outworn creeds, the. meaningless ceremonials and manmade institutions with which these religions are at present identified. 

 Our adversaries in the East have initiated the struggle. 

 Our future opponents in the 'West will, in their turn, arise and carry it a stage further. Ours is the duty, in anticipation of this inevitable contest, to uphold unequivocally and with undivided loyalty the integrity of our Faith and demonstrate the distinguishing features of its divinely appointed institutions." 

 Nothing could be clearer or more emphatic.  These words, asserting again the essential universality of the Cause, likewise repeat and renew the warning that the organized religions, even in America, will become bitterly hostile to the Faith of Baha'u'llah, denounce and oppose it, and seek its destruction in vain effort to maintain  their own "outworn creeds" and material power. Informed of this inevitable  development, can a Baha'i any longer desire to retain a connection which, however liberal and pleasing it now seems, is a connection with a potential foe of the Cause of God? 

 The Guardian's instruction signifies that the time has come when all American believers must become fully conscious of the implications of such connections,  and carry out their loyalty to its logical conclusion. 

 Shoghi Effendi's latest words are not merely an approval of the foregoing statement,  but a most helpful elucidation of some of the problems which arise when the friends turn to their local Assemblies for specific advice under various special circumstances. 

 "The explanatory statement in connection  with membership in non-BaM'i religious organizations is admirably conceived, convincing and in full conformity with the principles underlying and implied in the unfolding world order of Baha'u'llah." 
(No-vember  29, 1933.)     

 CCTh Guardian has carefully read the copy of the statement you had recently prepared concerning non-membership in nonBahA'i religious organizations, and is pleased to realize that your comments and explanations are in full conformity with his views on the subject. He hopes that your letter will serve to clarify this issue in the minds of all the believers, and to further convince them of its vital character and importance in the present stage of the evolution  of the Cause. 

 In this case,~ as also in that of suffering believers, the Assemblies, whether local or national, should act tactfully, patiently and in a friendly and kindly spirit. 

 Knowing how painful and dangerous  it is for such believers to repudiate A special case involving an aged believer, afflicted with illness, for whom severance of church relations might have been too great a shock.

  their former allegiances and friendships, they should try to gradually persuade them of the wisdom and necessity of such an action, and instead of thrusting upon them a new principle, to make them accept it inwardly, and out of pure conviction and desire. Too severe and immediate action in such cases is not oniy fruitless but actually harmful. 

 It alienates people instead of winning them to the 

Cause.                     

 ccThe other point concerns the advisability  of contributing to a church. In this case also the friends must realize that contributions to a church, especially when not regular, do not necessarily entail affiliation. The believers can make such offerings, occasionally, and provided they are certain that while doing so they are not connected as members of any church. 

 There should be no confusion between the terms affiliation and association. While affiliation with ecclesiastical organizations is not permissible,  association with them should not oniy be tolerated but even encouraged. There is no better way to demonstrate the universality of the Cause than this. Baha'u'llah, indeed, urges His followers to consort with all religions and nations with utmost friendliness and love. This constitutes the very spirit of His message to mankind." (December 11, 1935.) 

     The National Spiritual     

 Assembly trusts that the subject will receive the attention of local Assemblies and communities, and that in the light of the foregoing explanations the friends will find unity and agreement  in applying the instruction to whatever situations may arise. In teaching new believers let us lay a proper foundation so that their obedience will be voluntary and assured from the beginning of their enrollment  as Baha'is. In our attitude toward the older believers who are affected by the instruction let us act with the patience and kindliness the Guardian has urged. 
                           
                  BAHA'I S AND WAR

  A Statement by the National Spiritual Assembly 1

  One of the chief responsibilities of Baha'is in this transitional era is to grasp the principle upon which rests their loyalty to the Faith of Baha'u'llah in relation  to their duty toward their civil government.  This problem arises in its most difficult form in connection with our individual and collective attitude toward war. 

 Nothing could be more powerful than the Baha teachings on the subject of Peace. Not oniy does Baha'u'llah confirm the teachings of all former Manifestations which uphold amity and fellowship between  individual human beings, and the supremacy of love as the end and aim of mutual intercourse and association, but He likewise extends the divine law of Peace to governments and rulers, declaring to them that they are called upon to establish 

Peace

 and Justice upon earth, and uproot forever the dire calamity of international war. 

 Despite His Revelation, a most agonizing and excruciating conflict raged in Europe for four years, and since that war many other wars and revolutions have dyed the earth, while at present the heaven of human hope is black with the approach of a final world-shaking catastrophe. 

 What wonder that faithful Baha'is, abhorring  and detesting war as insane repudiation  of divine law, as destroyer of life and ruin of civilization, should now, in these fateful days, ponder how they may save their loved ones from the calamity of the battlefield, and how they may contribute their utmost to any and every effort aimed at the attainment of universal Peace? 

 Conscious of these heart-stirrings, and mindful of its responsibility toward all American believers, and particularly that radiant youth which would first of all be sacrificed in the event of a declaration of war by the government, the Natioiial Spir

  itual Assembly wishes to express its view upon the inatter, in the hope that the result of its study of the Teachings and of the Guardian's explanations will assist in bringing a unity of opinion and a clarification of thought among the friends. 

 Concerning the duty of Baha'is to their government, we have these words, written by 

Shoghi Effendi on January  

 1, ~929 (see ~ Administration," page 152): CCTO all these (that is, restrictive measures of the Soviet r~gime) the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have with feelings of burning agony and heroic fortitude unanimously  and unreservedly submitted, ever mindful of the guiding principle of Baha'i conduct that in connection with their administrative activities, no matter how grievously interference with them might affect the course of the extension of the Movement, and the suspension of which does not constitute in itself a departure from the principle of loyalty to their Faith, the considered judgment and authoritative decrees issued by their responsible rulers must, if they be faithful to Baha'u'llah's and ~ express injunctions, be thoroughly respected and loyally obeyed. In matters, however, that vitally affect the integrity and honor of the Faith of Baha'u'llah,  and are tantamount to a recantation of their faith and repudiation of their innermost belief, they are convinced, and are unhesitatingly prepared to vindicate by their lifeblood the sincerity of their conviction,  that no power on earth, neither the arts of the most insidious adversary nor the bloody weapons of the most tyrannical oppressor, can ever succeed in extorting from them a word or deed that might tend to stifle the voice of their conscience or varnish the purity of their faith." 

 In view of the fact that early Christians were persecuted because they refused to render military service, the question might be raised whether the above statement means that the Guardian includes refusal to bear arms as one of those matters which cCvitally affect the integrity and honor of the Faith and are tantamount to a recantation of their faith and repudiation of their innermost belief" — a question  the more important in that the early Christians preferred persecution to military service. 

 The answer to this question is that the Guardian instructs us that the obligation to render military duty placed by governments upon their citizens is a form of loyalty to one's government which the Baha'i must accept, but that the believers can, through their National AssemMy, seek exemption from active army duty provided their government recognizes the right of members of religious bodies making peace a matter of conscience to serve in some noncombatant service rather than as part of the armed force. 

    The National Spiritual     

 Assembly has investigated carefully this aspect of the situation, and has found that, whereas the government of the United St&tes did, in the last war, provide exemption from military duty on religious grounds, nevertheless this exemption was part of the Statutes bearing directly upon that war, and with the cessation of hostilities the exemption lapsed. In other words, there is today no basis on which any Baha'i may be exempted from military' duty in a possible future conflict. The National Assembly, consequently, cannot  at present make any petition for exemption of Baha'is from war service, for such petitions must be filed with reference to some specific Act or Statute under which exemption can be granted. The Assembly understands that, in the event of war, there will be some kind of provision for exemption  enacted, but as far as Baha'is are concerned,  no steps can be taken until this government declares itself in a state of war. 

 This explanation, it is hoped, will satisfy those who for some years have been urging that protection be secured for American Baha'i youth. 

 On the other hand it must be pointed out that it is no part of our teaching program to attract young people to the Cause merely in order to take advantage of any exemption  that may later on be officially obtained for duly enrolled Baha'is. The oniy justifiable reason for joining this Faith is because one realizes that it is a divine Cause and is ready and willing to accept whatever may befall a believer on the path of devotion. The persecutions which have been inflicted


<p204>
204              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  upon Baha'is so frequently make it clear that the path of devotion is one of sacrifice and not of ease or special privilege. 

 Another question encountered here and there among believers is what can Baha'is do to work for Peace? Outside the Cause we see many organizations with peace programs,  and believers occasionally feel that it is their duty to join such movements and thereby work for a vital Baha'i principle. 

 It is the view of the National Spiritual Assembly that activity in and for tbe Cause itself is the supreme service to world peace. The Baha'i community of the world is the true example of Peace. The Baha principles are the only ones upon which Peace can be established. 

 Therefore, by striving to enlarge the number of declared believers, and broadcasting the Teachings of BaM 'u'llAh, we are doing the utmost to rid humanity of the scourge of war. 

 Of what use to spend time and money upon incomplete human programs when we have the universal program of the Manifestation of God? 

 The firm union of the Baha is in active devotion to the advancement of their own Faith — this is our service to Peace, as it is our service to all other human needs —  economic justice, race amity, religious unity, etc. Let nonbelievers agitate for disarmament and circulate petitions for this and that pacifist aim — a Baha'i truly alive in this Faith will surely prefer to base his activities upon the foundation laid by Baha'u'llah, walk the path which the Master trod all His days, and heed the appeals which the Guardian has given us to initiate a new era in the public teaching of the Message. 
                           
       THE WILL AND TESTAMENT OF CABDU~L BAIl

  Excerpts Made by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, by Direction of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha'i Faith NVELL is it with him who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Baha'u'llah and rendereth thanks unto his Lord! 

 For He assuredly will be made manifest. God hath indeed ordained it in the Bayin. — The 13db. ("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah," pages 54 — S 5.) 

  The world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind's ordered life bath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed. — Baha'u'llah. ("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah," page 54.) 

  It is incumbent upon the Aglis5.n, the Afn&n and My kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most Mighty Branch. 

 Consider that which We have revealed  in Our Most Holy Book: "When the ocean of My presence bath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who bath branched from this Ancient Root." 

 The object of this sacred verse is none except the Most Mighty Branch (tAbdu'1-Bahi). 

 Thus have We graciously revealed unto you Our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the All-Power  ful. — Baha'u'llah. 

 ("The Dispensation  of Baha'u'llah," page 42.) 

  There hath branched from the Sadratu'1-Munvah~ this sacred and glorious Being, this Branch of Holiness; well is it with him that hath sought His shelter and abideth beneath His shadow. Verily the Limb of the Law of God hath sprung forth from this Root which God hath firmly implanted in the Ground of His Will, and Whose Branch hath been so uplifted as to encompass  the whole of creation. — Baha'u'llah. ("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah," page 43.) 

  In accordance with the explicit text of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah hath made the Center of the Covenant the Interpreter of His Word — a Covenant so firm and


<p205>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 205

  mighty that from the beginning of time until the present day no religious Dispensation hath produced its 1ike. — Abdu'l-Baha. (c(The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah," page 44.) 

 tAbdu'I-Bahi Who incarnates an institution  for which we can find no parallel whatsoever in any of the world's recognized religious systems, may be said to have closed the Age to which He Himself belonged and opened the one in which we are now laboring.  His Will and Testament should thus be regarded as the perpetual, the indissoluble  link which the mind of Him Who is the Mystery of God has conceived in order to insure the continuity of the three ages that constitute the component parts of the Baha'i Dispensation. 

  The creative energies released by the Law of Baha'u'llah, permeating and evolving within the mind of tAbdu'1-BahA have, by their very impact and close interaction, given birth to an Instrument which may be viewed as the Charter of the New World Order which is at once the glory and the promise of this most great Dispensation. The Will may thus be acclaimed as the inevitable  offspring resulting from that mystic intercourse between Him Who communicated  the generating influence of His divine Purpose and the One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient. 

 Being the Child of the Covenant — the Heir of both the Originator and the Interpreter of the Law of God — the Will and Testament of CAbdu~I~Bahi can no more be divorced from Him Who supplied the original and mod-'rating impulse than from the One Who ultimately conceived it. Baha'u'llah's inscrutable purpose, we must ever bear in mind, has been so thoroughly infused into the conduct of tAbdu'1-BahA, and their motives have been so closely wedded together,  that the mere attempt to dissociate the teachings of the former from any system which the ideal Exemplar of those same teachings has established would amount to a repudiation of one of the most sacred and basic truths of the Faith. 

  The Administrative Order, which ever since tAbdu'1-BaM's ascension has evolved and is taking shape under our very eyes in no fewer than forty countries of the world, may be considered as the framework of the Will itself, the inviolable stronghold wherein  this newborn child is being nurtured and develops. 

 This Administrative Order, as it expands and consolidates itself, will no doubt manifest the potentialities and reveal the full implications of this momentous Document — this most remarkable expression of tile 'Will of One of the most remarkable Figures of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah. It will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fulness of time the whole of mankind. — Shoghi 

Effendi. ('The Dispensation
of Baha'u'llah," pages 5152.)

  ALL-PRAISE to Him Who, by the Shield of His Covenant, hath guarded the Temple of His Cause from the darts of doubtfulness,  Who by the Hosts of His Testament hath preserved the Sanctuary of His Most Beneficent Law and protected His 

Straight and Luminous      

 Path, staying thereby the onslaught  of the company of Covenant-breakers, that have threatened to subvert His Divine Edifice; Who hath watched over His Mighty Stronghold and All-glorious Faith, through the aid of men whom the slander of the slanderer affects not, whom no earthly calling, glory and power can turn aside from the Covenant of God and His Testament, established firmly by His clear and manifest words, writ and revealed by 

His All-glorious Pen       
and recorded in the Preserved

Tablet.                    

 Salutation and praise, blessing and glory rest upon that primal branch of the Divine and Sacred Late-Tree, grown out, blest, tender, verdant and flourishing from the Twin Holy Trees; the most wondrous, unique and priceless pearl that doth gleam from out the Twin Surging Seas; upon the offshoots of the Tree of Holiness, the twigs of the Celestial Tree, they that in the Day of the Great Dividing have stood fast and firm in the Covenant; upon the Hands


<p206>
206             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  (pillars) of the Cause of God that have diffused widely the Divine Fragrances, declared  His Proofs, proclaimed His Faith, published abroad His Law, detached themselves  from all things but Him, stood for righteousness in this world, and kindled the Fire of the Love of God in the very hearts and souis of His servants; upon them that have believed, rested assured,  stood steadfast in His Covenant and followed the Light that after my passing shineth from the Dayspring of Divine Guidance — for behold! he is the blest and sacred bough that hath branched out from the Twin Holy Trees. 

 Well is it with him that seeketh the shelter  of his shade that shadoweth all mankind. 
    0     ye beloved of the Lord!

 The greatest of all things is the protection of the True Faith of God, the preservation of His Law, the safeguarding of His Cause and service unto His Word. Ten thousand souis have shed streams of their sacred blood in this path, their precious lives they offered in sacrifice  unto Him, hastened wrapt in holy ecstasy unto the glorious field of martyrdom,  upraised the Standard of God's Faith and writ with their lifeblood upon the Tablet of the world the verses of His Divine Unity. The sacred breast of His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my life be a sacrifice unto Him), was made a target to many a dart of woe, and in Mizindar~n, the Blessed feet of the Abbi Beauty (may my life be offered up for His loved ones) were so grievously scourged as to bleed and be sore wounded. His neck also was put into captive chains and His feet made fast in the stocks. In every hour, for a period of fifty years, a new trial and calamity befell Him and fresh afflictions and cares beset Him. One of them: after having suffered intense vicissitudes, He was made homeless and a wanderer and fell a victim to still new vexations and troubles. In tlrAq, the DayStar of the world was so exposed to the wiles of the people of malice as to be eclipsed in splendor. Later on Tie was sent an exile to the Great City (Con-stantinople) and thence to the Land of Mystery (Adrianople), whence, grievously wronged, He was eventually transferred to the Most Great Prison (tAkk6). He Whom the world bath wronged (may my life be offered up for His loved ones) was four times banished from city to city, till at last condemned to perpetual confinement, He was incarcerated in this Prison, the prison of highway robbers, of brigands and of manslayers. All this is but one of the trials that have afflicted the Blessed Beauty, the rest being even as grievous as this. 

  According to the direct and sacred command  of God we are forbidden to utter slander, are commanded to show forth peace and amity, are exhorted to rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and harmony  with all the kindreds and peoples of the world. We must obey and be the well-wishers of the governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king as disloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government a transgression of the 

Cause of God.             

 0     God, my God! Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine, held fast in the talons of ferocious lions, of ravening wolves, of bloodthirsty beasts. Graciously assist me, through my love for Thee, that I may drink deep of the chalice that brim-meth  over with faithfulness to Thee and is filled with Thy bountiful Grace; so that, fallen upon the dust, I may sink prostrate and senseless whilst my vesture is dyed crimson with my blood. This is my wish, my heart's desire, my hope, niy pride, my glory. Grant, 0 Lord my God, and my Refuge, that in my last hour, my end, may even as musk shed its fragrance of glory! Is there a bounty greater than this? Nay, by 

Thy Glory! I call Thee    

 to witness that no day passeth but that I quaff my fill from this cup, so grievous are the misdeeds wrought by them that have broken the Covenant, kindled discord, showed their malice, stirred sedition in the land and dishonored  Thee amidst Thy servants. 

 Lord! Shield Thou from these Covenant-breakers the mighty Stronghold of Thy Faith and protect 

Thy secret Sanctuary      

 from the onslaught  of the ungodly. Thou art in truth the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious, the 

Strong.

  o     God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of self and passion, protect them with the watchful eye of Thy loving kindness from all rancor, hate and envy, shelter them in the impregnable stronghold of Thy Cause and, safe from the darts of doubtfulness, make them the manifestations of Thy glorious Signs, illumine their faces with the effulgent rays shed from the Dayspring of Thy Divine Unity, gladden their hearts with the verses revealed from Thy Holy Kingdom, strengthen their loins by Thy all-swaying power that cometh from

When the hour corneth that this wronged and broken winged bird will have taken flight unto the celestial concourse, when it will have hastened to the Realm of the Unseen and its mortal frame will have been either lost or hidden neath the dust, it is incumbent upon the Afnin, that are steadfast  in the Covenant of God, and have branched from the Tree of Holiness; the Hands (pillars), of the Cause of God (the glory of the Lord rest upon them), and all the friends and loved ones, one and all to bestir themselves and arise with heart and soul and in one accord, to diffuse the sweet savors of God, to teach His Cause and to promote His Faith. It behooveth them not to rest for a moment, neither to seek repose. They must disperse themselves in every land, pass by every clime and travel throughout all regions. Bestirred, without rest and steadfast to the end they must raise in every land the triumphal cry "0 Thou the Glory of Glories!" (Y~-Bah~'u'1-AbliA), must achieve renown in the world wherever they go, must burn brightly even as a candle in every meeting and must kindle the flame of Divine love in every assembly; that the light of truth may rise resplendent in the midmost heart of the world, that throughout the East and throughout the West a vast concourse may gather under the shadow of the Word of God, that the sweet savors of holiness may be diffused, that faces may shine radiantly, hearts be filled with the Divine spirit and souls be made heavenly. 

 In these days, the most important of all things is the guidance of the nations and peoples of the world. Teaching the Cause is of utmost importance for it is the head cornerstone of the foundation itself. 

 This wronged servant has spent his days and nights in promoting the Cause and urging the peoples to service. He rested not a moment, till the fame of the Cause of God was noised abroad in the world and the celestial strains from the Abh~ Kingdom roused the East and the West. The be-lQved of God must also follow the same example. This is the secret of faithfulness, this is the requirement of servitude to the Threshold of BaLl The disciples of Christ forgot themselves and all earthly things, forsook all their cares and belongings, purged themselves of self and passion and with absolute detachment  scattered far and wide and engaged in calling the peoples of the world to the Divine Guidance, till at last they made the world another world, illumined the surface of the earth and even to their last hour proved self-sacrificing in the pathway of that Beloved One of God. Finally in various  lands they suffered glorious martyrdom. Let them that are men of action follow in their footsteps! 

 0     my loving friends! After the passing away of this wronged one, it is incumbent upon the Aghs~n (Branches), the Afn~n (Twigs) of the 

Sacred Lote-Tree, the Hands

 (pillars) of the Cause of God and the loved ones of the Ab1A Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendi — the youthful branch branched from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees and the fruit grown from the union of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holiness — as he is the sign of God, the chosen branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom all the Aghsin, the Afnin, the Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones must turn. He is the expounder of the words of God and after him will succeed the firstborn of his lineal descendants. 

 The sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally  elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abh~


<p208>
208             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso dis-believeth  in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him! The mighty stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience  to him who is the guardian of the Cause of God. It is incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice, upon all the Aghsin, the Afn&n, the Hands of the Cause of God to show their obedience, submissiveness and subordination unto the guardian of the Cause of God, to turn unto him and be iowiy before him. 

 He that opposeth him bath opposed the True One, will make a breach in the Cause of God, will subvert His word and will become a manifestation of the Center of Sedition. Beware, beware, lest the days after the ascension (of Baha'u'llah) be repeated when the Center of Sedition waxed haughty and rebellious and with Divine Unity for his excuse deprived himself and perturbed and poisoned others. No doubt every vainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord will not openly declare his evil purposes, nay rather, even as impure gold, would he seize upon divers measures and various pretexts that he may separate the gathering of the people of Baha. 

 My object  is to show that the Hands of the Cause of God must be ever watchful and so soon as they find anyone beginning  to oppose and protest against the guardian of the Cause of God cast him out from the congregation of the people of Baha and in no wise accept any excuse from him. How often hath grievous error been disguised in the garb of truth, that it might sow the seeds of doubt in the hearts of men! 
     0     ye beloved of the Lord!

 It is incumbent  upon the guardian of the Cause of God to appoint in his own lifetime him that shall become his successor, that differences may not arise after his passing. 

 He that is appointed must manifest in himself detachment from all worldly things, must be the essence of purity, must show in himself the fear of God, knowledge, wisdom and learning.  Thus, should the firstborn of the guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth of the words: — t~The child is the secret essence of its sire," that is, should he not inherit of the spiritual within him (the guardian of the Cause of God) and his glorious lineage not be matched with a goodly character, then must he (the guardian of the Cause of God), choose another branch to succeed him. 

 The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number, nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in the work of the guardian of the Cause of God. 

 The election  of these nine must be carried either unanimously or by majority from the company  of the Hands of the Cause of God and these, whether unanimously or by a majority vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the guardian of the Cause of God bath chosen as his successor. This assent must be given in such wise as the assenting and dissenting voices may not be distinguished (secret ballot). 

 0     friends! The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed by the guardian of the Cause of God. All must be under his shadow and obey his command. Should any, within or without the company of the Hands of the Cause of God, disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance will be upon him, for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of God. 

 The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the character of all men and to be, at all times and under all conditions, sanctified and detached from


<p209>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 209

  earthly things. They must manifest the fear of God by their conduct, their manners,  their deeds and their words. 

 This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the guardian of the Cause of God. He must continually urge them to strive and endeavor to the utmost of their ability to diffuse the sweet savors of God, and to guide all the peoples of the world, for it is the light of Divine Guidance that causeth all the universe to be illumined. 

 To disregard, though it be for a moment, this absolute command which is binding upon everyone, is in no wise permitted, that the existent world may become even as the AbhA Paradise, that the surface of the earth may become heavenly, that contention and conflict amidst peoples, kindreds, nations and governments may disappear,  that all the dwellers on earth may become one people and one race, that the world may become even as one home. Should differences arise they shall be amicably and conclusively settled by the Supreme Tribunal, that shall include members from all the governments and peoples of the world. 
 0     ye beloved of the Lord!

 in this sacred Dispensation, conflict and contention are in no wise permitted. 

 Every aggressor deprives himself of God's grace. 

 It is incumbent  upon everyone to show the utmost love, rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and sincere kindliness unto all the peoples and kindreds of the world, be they friends or strangers. 

 So intense must be the spirit of love and lovingkindness, that the stranger may find himself a friend, the enemy a true brother, no difference whatsoever existing between them. 

 For universality  is of God and all limitations earthly. 

 Thus man must strive that his reality may manifest virtues and perfections, the light whereof may shine upon everyone. The light of the sun shineth upon all the world and the merciful showers of Divine Providence fall upon all peoples. The vivifying breeze reviveth every living creature and all beings endued with life obtain their share and portion at His heavenly board. 

 In like manner, the affections and lovingkindness of the servants of the One True God must be bountifully and universally extended to all mankind. Regarding this, restrictions and limitations are in no wise permitted. 

 Wherefore, 0 my loving friends! Consort  with all the peoples, kindreds and religions of the world with the utmost truthfulness, uprightness, faithfulness, kindliness, goodwill and friendliness; that all the world of being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of the grace of Baha, that ignorance, enmity, hate and rancor may vanish from the world and the darkness  of estrangement amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may give way to the Light of Unity. Should other peoples and nations be unfaithful to you show your fidelity unto them, should they be unjust toward you show justice towards them, should they keep aloof from you attract them to yourself, should they show their enmity be friendly towards them, should they poison your lives sweeten theii souls, should they inflict a wound upon you be a salve to their sores. Such are the attributes of the sincere! Such are the attributes of the truthful. 

 And now, concerning the House of Justice  which God hath ordained as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members must be manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings  of knowledge and understanding, must be steadfast in God's faith and the well-wishers of all mankind. By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, that is, in all countries, a secondary House of Justice must be instituted, and these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the Universal one. Unto this body all things must be referred. 

 It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text. By this body all the difficult problems  are to be resolved and the guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished member for life of that body. 

 Should he not attend in person its deliberations, he must appoint one to represent  him. Should any of the members commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the guardian of the Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel


<p210>
210             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  him, whereupon the people must elect another one in his stead. This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The legislative body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the legislative body so that through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the foundation of fairness and justice may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the world may become even as Paradise itself. 

  0     ye beloved of the Lord! 

 It is incumbent  upon you to be submissive to all monarchs that are just and show your fidelity to every righteous king. 

 Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty. Show obedience unto them and be their well-wishers. 

 Without  their leave and permission do not meddle with political affairs, for disloyalty to the just sovereign is disloyalty to God himself. 

 This is my counsel and the commandment  of God unto you. Well is it with them that act accordingly. 

  o     dearly beloved friends! 

 I am now in very great danger and the hope of even an hour's life is lost to me. I am thus constrained  to write these lines for the protection of the Cause of God, the preservation  of His Law, the safeguarding of His Word, and the safety of His Teachings. By the 

Ancient Beauty! This       

 wronged one hath in no wise borne nor doth he bear a grudge against any one; towards none doth he entertain any ill-feeling and uttereth no word save for the good of the world. My supreme obligation, however, of necessity, prompteth me to guard and preserve the Cause of God. Thus, with the greatest regret, I counsel you saying:~~~ccGuard ye the Cause of God, protect His law and have the utmost fear of discord. This is the foundation of the belief of the people of Bali (may my life be offered up for them). 

CCHiS Holiness, the Exalted

 One, (the Bib) is the Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the Forerunner of the 

Ancient Beauty. His Holiness

 the AbM Beauty (may my life be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence. All others are servants unto Him and do His bidding." Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the Purpose  of God himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love dis. cord, bath shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant. By this House is meant that Universal House of Justice which is to be elected from all countries, that is, from those parts in the East and West where the loved ones are to be found, after the manner of the customary  elections in Western countries such as those of England. 

 It is incumbent upon these members (of the Universal House of Justice) to gather in a certain place and deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book. Whatsoever they decide has the same effect as the Text itself. 

 And inasmuch as this House of Justice hath power to enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book and bear upon daily transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same. Thus for example, the House of Justice enacteth today a certain law and enforceth it, and a hundred years hence, circumstances haying  profoundly changed and the conditions having altered, another House of Justice will then have power, according to the exigencies of the time, to alter that law. This it can do because that law forncieth no part of the Divine 

Explicit Text. The House   

 of Justice is both the Initiator and the Abrogator of its own laws. 

  And now, one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts exerted in the past. 0 friends! It behooveth you to call to mind with tenderness the trials of His Holiness, the Exalted One and show


<p211>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 211

  your fidelity to the Ever-Blest Beauty. The utmost endeavor must be exerted lest all these woes, trials and afflictions, all this pure and sacred blood that hath been shed so profusely in the Path of God, may prove to be in vain. 
     0     ye beloved of the Lord!

 Strive with all your heart to shield the Cause of God from the onslaught of the insincere, for souis such as these cause the straight to become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce contrary results. 

 o     God, my God! II call Thee, Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, Thy Saints and Thy Holy Ones, to witness that I have declared conclusively Thy Proofs unto Thy loved ones and set forth clearly all things unto them, that they may watch over 

Thy Faith, guard Thy Straight
Path and protect  Thy    

Resplendent Law. Thou     

 art, verily, the All-knowing, the All-wise! 

  Whosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh  a hindrance to the diffusion of the Light of Faith, let the loved ones give them counsel and say: CCQf all the gifts of God the greatest is the gift of Teaching. 

 It draweth unto us the Grace of God and is our first obligation. Of such a gift how can we deprive ourselves? Nay, our lives, our goods, our comforts, our rest, we offer them all as a sacrifice for the Abhi Beauty and teach the Cause of God." Caution and prudence, however, must be observed even as recorded in the Book. The veil must in no wise be suddenly rent asunder. The Glory of Glories rest upon you. 

 0     ye the faithful loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Baha! 

 It is incumbent upon you to take the greatest care of Shoghi Effendi, the twig that hath branched from and the fruit given forth by the two hallowed and Divine Lote-Trees, that no dust of despondency and sorrow may stain his radiant nature, that day by day he may wax greater in happiness, in joy and spirituality, and may grow to become even as a fruitful tree. 

 For he is, after cAbdu~1~Bahi the guardian  of the Cause of God, the Afnin, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause and the beloved of the Lord must obey him and turn unto him. He that obeyeth him not, hath not obeyed God; he that turneth away from him, hath turned away from God and he that denieth him, hath denied the True One. Beware lest anyone falsely interpret these words, and like unto them that have broken the Covenant after the Day of Ascension (of Baha'u'llah) advance a pretext,  raise the standard of revolt, wax stubborn and open wide the door of false interpretation. 

 To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or express his particular convictions. 

 All must seek guidance and turn unto the Center of the Cause and the House of Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever else is indeed in grievous error. 

 The Glory of Glories rest upon you! 

  Let no one, while this System is still in its infancy, misconceive its character, belittle its significance or misrepresent its purpose. The bedrock on which this Administrative Order is founded is God's immutable Purpose for mankind in this day. The Source from which it derives its in —  spiration is no one less than Baha'u'llah Himself. 

 Its shield and defender are the embattled hosts of the AbIA Kingdom. Its seed is the blood of no less than twenty thousand martyrs who have offered up their lives that it may be born and flourish. 

 The axis round which its institutions revolve are the authentic provisions of the Will and Testament of cAbdu~1~Bahi. Its guiding principles are the truths which He Who is the unerring Interpreter of the teachings of our Faith has so clearly enunciated in His public addresses throughout the West. The laws that govern its operation and limit its functions are those which have been expressly ordained in the KITAB-I-AQDAS. The seat round which its spiritual, its humanitarian and administrative activities will cluster are the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and its Dependencies. 

 The pillars that sustain its authority and buttress its structure are the twin institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice. The central, the underlying aim which animates it is the establishment of the New 'World Order as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah. 

 The methods it employs, the standard it incul-. cates, incline it to neither East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor

  poor, neither white nor colored. Its watchword is the unification of the human race; its standard the "Most Great Peace"; its consummation the advent of that golden millennium — the Day when the kingdoms of this world shall have become the Kingdom  of 

 God Himself, the Kingdom   
 of Baha'u'llah. — SHoGrn

     EXCERPTS FROM THE LETTERS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI

  J HAVE been acquainted by the perusal of your latest communications with the nature of the doubts that have been publicly  expressed, by one who is wholly misinformed as to the true precepts of the Cause, regarding the validity of institutions that stand inextricably interwoven with the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Not that I for a moment view such faint misgivings in the light of an open challenge to the structure that embodies the Faith, nor is it because I question in the least the unyielding tenac-fry  of the faith of the American believers, if I venture to dwell upon what seems to me appropriate observations at the present stage of the evolution of our beloved Cause. I am indeed inclined to welcome these expressed  apprehensions inasmuch as they afford me an opportunity to familiarize the elected representatives of the believers with the origin and character of the institutions which stand at the very basis of the world order ushered in by Baha'u'llah. We should feel truly thankful for such futile attempts to undermine our beloved Faith — attempts that protrude their ugly face from time to time, seem for a while able to create a breach in the ranks of the faithful, recede finally into the obscurity of oblivion, and are thought of no more. 

 Such incidents we should regard as the interpositions of Providence, designed to fortify our faith, to clarify our vision, and to deepen our understanding of the essentials of His 

Divine Revelation.         

 it would, however, be helpful and instructive  to bear in mind certain basic principles with reference to the Will and Testament of Abdu'l-Baha, which together with the Kitab — i-.Aqdas, constitutes the chief depositary wherein are enshrined those priceless elements of that Divine Civiliza-. tion, the establishment of which is the primary mission of the Baha'i Faith. A study of the provisions of these sacred documents will reveal the close relationship that exists between them, as well as the identity of purpose and method which they inculcate. Far from regarding their specific provisions as incompatible and contradictory in spirit, every fair-minded inquirer will readily admit that they are not oniy complementary, but that they mutually confirm one another, and are inseparable parts of one complete unit. A comparison of their contents with the rest of Baha'i Sacred 'Writings will similarly establish the conformity of whatever they contain with the spirit as well as the letter of the authenticated writings and sayings of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-BahA. 

 In fact, he who reads the Aqdas with care and diligence will not find it hard to discover that the Most Holy Book [Aqdas] itself anticipates in a number of passages the institutions which tAbdu~1~ Bali ordains in His Will. By leaving certain  matters unspecified and unregulated in His Book of Laws [Aqd as], 

 Baha'u'llah seems to have deliberately left a gap in the general scheme of Baha Dispensation, which the unequivocal provisions of the Master's W'iIl has filled. To attempt to divorce the one from the other, to insinuate that the Teachings of Baha'u'llah have not been upheld, in their entirety and with absolute integrity, by what tAbdu'1-Bah& has revealed in his Will, is an unpardonable affront to the unswerving fidelity that has characterized the life and labors of our beloved Master. 

 I will not attempt in the least to assert or demonstrate the authenticity of the Will and Testament of Abdu'l-Baha, for that in itself would betray an apprehension on my part as to the unanimous confidence of the believers in the genuineness of the last written  wishes of our departed Master. 

 I will oniy confine my observations to those issues


<p213>
THE WORLD ORDER OF I3AHA'U'LLAH                                213

  which may assist them to appreciate the essential unity that underlies the spiritual, the humanitarian, and the administrative principles enunciated by the Author and the Interpreter of the Baha'i Faith. 

 I am at a ioss to explain that strange mentality that inclines to uphold as the soic criterion of the truth of the Baha'i Teachings  what is admittedly only an obscure and unauthenticated translation of an oral statement made by ~Abd'1Bh' in defiance  and total disregard of the available text of all of His universally recognized writings. I truly deplore the unfortunate distortions that have resulted in days past from the' incapacity of the interpreter to grasp the meaning of tAbdu'1-Bah4, and from his incompetence to render adequately such truths as have been revealed to him by the Master's statements. Much of the confusion that has obscured the understanding  of the believers should be attributed to this double error involved in the inexact rendering of an only partially understood statement. 

 Not infrequently has the interpreter even failed to convey the exact purport of the inquirer's specific questions, and, by his deficiency of understanding  and expression in conveying the answer of tAbdu'1-Bahi, has been responsible for reports wholly at variance with the true spirit and purpose of the Cause. 

 It was chiefly in view of this misleading nature of the reports of the informal conversations of tAbdu'1-Bahi with visiting pilgrims, that I have insistently urged the believers of the West to regard such statements as merely personal impressions of the sayings of their Master, and to quote and consider as authentic oniy such translations as are based upon the authenticated text of His recorded utterances in the original tongue. 

 It should be remembered by every follower  of the Cause that the system of Ba-hi'i  administration is not an innovation imposed arbitrarily upon the Baha'is of the world since the Master's passing, but derives its authority from the Will and Testament of rAbdu~l~Bah6, is specifically prescribed in unnumbered Tablets, and rests in some of its essential features upon the explicit provisions of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. 

 It thus unifies and correlates the principles sepa rately laid down by Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha,  and is indissolubly bound with the essential verities of the Faith. To dissociate the administrative principles of the Cause from the purely spiritual and humanitarian  teachings would be tantamount to a mutilation of the body of the Cause, a separation that can only result in the disintegration of its component parts, and the extinction of the Faith itself. 
                           
Local and National Houses  

 of Justice IT should be carefully borne in mind that the local as well as the international Houses of Justice have been expressly enjoined by the Kitab-i-Aqdas; that the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly, as an intermediary body, and referred to in the Master's Will as the "Secondary House of Justice," has the express sanction of ~Abdu'1 Baha; and that the method to be pursued for the election of the International and National Houses of Justice has been set forth by Him in His Will, as well as in a number of His Tablets. Moreover, the institutions  of the local and national Funds, that are now the necessary adjuncts to all Local and National Spiritual Assemblies, have not only been established by tAbdu'1-BaM in the Tablets He revealed to the Baha'is of the Orient, but their importance and necessity have been repeatedly emphasized  by Him in His utterances and writings. 

 The concentration of authority in the hands of the elected representatives of the believers; the necessity of the submission of every adherent of the raith to the considered judgment of Baha'i Assemblies; His preference for unanimity in decision; the decisive character of the majority vote; and even the desirability for the exercise of close supervision over all Baha'i publications,  have been sedulously instilled by Abdu'l-Baha, as evidenced by His authenticated and widely-scattered 

Tablets. To accept  His   

 broad and humanitarian Teachings on one hand, and to reject and dismiss with neglectful indifference His more challenging and distinguishing precepts, would be an act of manifest disloyalty to that which He has cherished most in His life. 

       That the Spiritual Assemblies

 of today will be replaced in time by the Houses of


<p214>
214             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Justice, and are to all intents and purposes identical and not separate bodies, is abundantly  confirmed by cAbdu~1~BahA Himself. He has in fact in a Tablet addressed to the members of the first Chicago Spiritual Assembly,  the first elected Baha'i body instituted  in the United States, referred to them as the members of the ccHouse of Justice" for that city, and has thus with His own pen established beyond any doubt the identity  of the present 

Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies 

 with the Houses of Justice referred to by Baha'u'llah. 

 For reasons which are not difficult to discover, it has been found advisable to bestow upon the elected representatives  of Baha'i communities throughout the world the temporary appellation of Spiritual Assemblies, a term which, as the position and aims of the Baha'i Faith are better understood and more fully recognized,  will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more appropriate designation of House of Justice. Not oniy will the presentday Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future, but will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an independent and 

Sovereign  Power. And     

 as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of East and 'West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the Universal House of Justice attain the plentitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent  upon the world's future super-state. 

 It must be pointed out, however, in this connection that, contrary to what has been confidently asserted, the establishment of the 

Supreme House of Justice   

 is in no way dependent upon the adoption of the Baha'i Faith by the mass of the peoples of the world, nor does it presuppose its acceptance by the majority of the inhabitants of any one country. In fact, cAbd~1BhA Himself, in one of His earliest Tablets, contemplated the possibility of the formation of the Universal House of Justice in His own lifetime, and but for the unfavorable circumstances  prevailing under the Turkish r6gime, would have, in all probability, taken the preliminary steps for its establishment. It will be evident, therefore, that given favorable circumstances, under which the Baha'is of Inn and of the adjoining countries  under Soviet Rule may be enabled to elect their national representatives, in accordance  with the guiding principles laid down in tAbdu'1-Bah4's writings, the only remaining obstacle in the way of the definite formation of the International House of Justice will have been removed. For upon the National Houses of Justice of the East and West devolves the task, in conformity with the explicit provisions of the Will, of electing directly the members of the International 

House of Justice. Not      

 until they are themselves fully representative of the rank and file of the believers in their respective  countries, not until they have acquired the weight and the experience that will enable them to function vigorously in the organic life of the Cause, tan they approach their sacred task, and provide the spiritual basis for the constitution of so august a body in the Baha world. 

J     The Institution of Guardianship

  T must be also clearly understood by every believer that the institution of Guardianship  does not under any circumstances abrogate, or even in the slightest degree detract  from, the powers granted to the Universal  House of 

Justice by Baha'u'llah     

 in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and repeatedly and solemnly confirmed by cAbdu~1~Bah& in His Will. It does not constitute in any manner a contradiction to the AK/ill and Writings  of Baha'u'llah, nor does it nullify any of His revealed instructions. 

 It enhances the prestige of that exalted assembly, stabilizes  its supreme position, safeguards its unity, assures the continuity of its labors, without presuming in the slightest to infringe  upon the inviolability of its clearly defined sphere of jurisdiction. We stand indeed too close to so monumental a document  to claim for ourselves a complete understanding  of all its implications, or to presume to have grasped the manifold mys


<p215>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                          215

  teries it undoubtedly contains. Only future generations can comprehend the value and the significance attached to this Divine Masterpiece, which the hand of the Master-builder  of the world has designed for the unification and the triumph of the worldwide 

Faith of Baha'u'llah. Only   

 those who come after us will be in a position to realize the value of the surprisingly strong emphasis  that has been placed on the institution of the House of Justice and of the Guardianship. 

 They oniy will appreciate the significance  of the vigorous language employed by tAbdu'1-Balxi with reference to the band of Covenant-breakers that has opposed Him in His days. To them alone will be revealed the suitability of the institutions initiated by Abdu'l-Baha to the character of the future society which is to emerge out of the chaos and confusion of the present age. 
                           
The Animating Purpose      
of Baha'i                  

       Institutions               

 And, now, it behooves us to reflect on the animating purpose and the primary functions  of these divinely-established institutions,  the sacred character and the universal efficacy of which can be demonstrated only by the spirit they diffuse and the work they actually achieve. I need not dwell upon what I have already reiterated and emphasized that the administration of the Cause is to be conceived as an instrument and not a substitute for the Faith of Baha'u'llah, that it should be regarded as a channel  through which His promised blessings may flow, that it should guard against such rigidity as would clog and fetter the liberating  forces released by His Revelation. 

 Who, I may ask, when viewing the international  character of the Cause, its far-flung ramifications, the increasing complexity of its affairs, the diversity of its adherents, and the state of confusion that assails on every side the infant Faith of God, can for a moment question the necessity of some sort of administrative machinery that will insure, amid the storm and stress of a struggling  civilization, the unity of the Faith, the preservation of its identity, and the protection  of its interests? To repudiate the validity of the assemblies of the elected ministers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah would be to reject these countless Tablets of Baha'u'llah  and Abdu'l-Baha, wherein they have extolled their privileges and duties, emphasized  the glory of their mission, revealed the immensity of their task, and warned them of the attacks they must needs expect from the unwisdorn of friends, as well as from the malice of their enemies. It is surely for those to whose hands so priceless a heritage has been committed to prayerfully watch lest the tool should supersede the Faith itself,  lest undue concern for the minute details  arising from the administration of the Cause obscure the vision of its promoters, lest partiality, ambition, and worldliness tend in the course of time to becloud the radiance, stain the purity, and impair the effectiveness of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.

           THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH

  AMID the reports that have of late reached the Holy Land, most of which witness  to the triumphant march of the Cause, a few seem to betray a certain apprehension regarding the validity of the institutions which stand inseparably associated with the raith of Baha'u'llah. 

 These expressed misgivings appear to be actuated by certain whisperings which have emanated from quarters which are either wholly misinformed  regarding the fundamentals of the Baha Revelation, or which deliberately contrive to sow the seeds of dissension in the hearts of the faithful. 

 Viewed in the light of past experience, the inevitable result of such futile attempts, however persistent and malicious they be, is to contribute to a wider and deeper recognition by believers and unbelievers alike of the distinguishing features of the Faith proclaimed  by Baha'u'llah. 

 These challenging criticisms, whether or not dictated by malice,  cannot but serve to galvanize the souis of its ardent supporters, and to consolidate


<p216>
216             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the ranks of its faithful promoters. They will purge the Faith from those pernicious elements whose continued association with the believers tends to discredit the fair name of the Cause, and to tarnish the pur-fry  of its spirit. 

 We should welcome, therefore, not only the open attacks which its avowed enemies persistently launch against it, but should also view as a blessing in disguise every storm of mischief with which they who apostatize their faith or claim to be its faithful exponents assail it from time to time. Instead of undermining the Faith, such assaults, both from within and without, reinforce its foundations, and excite the intensity of its flame. Designed to becloud its radiance, they proclaim to all the world the exalted character of its precepts,  the completeness of its unity, the uniqueness of its position, and the pervasiveness  of its influence. 

 I do not feel for one moment that such clamor, mostly attributable to impotent rage against the resisdess march of the Cause of God, can ever distress the valiant warriors of the Faith. For these heroic souis, whether they be contending in America's impregnable stronghold, or struggling in the heart of Europe, and across the seas as far as the continent of Australia,  have already abundantly demonstrated the tenacity of their faith and the abiding value of their conviction. 

 I feel it, however, incumbent upon me by virtue of the responsibility attached to the Guardianship of the Faith, to dwell more fully upon the essential character and the distinguishing features of that world order as conceived by Baha'u'llah. 

 It behooves us, dear friends, to endeavor not oniy to familiarize ourselves with the essential features of this supreme Handiwork of Baha'u'llah, but also to grasp the fundamental difference existing between this world-embracing, divinely-appointed Order and the chief ecclesiastical organizations of the world, whether they pertain to the Church of Christ, or to the ordinances of the 

Muhammadan Dispensation.   

 For those whose priceless privilege is to guard over, administer the affairs, and advance  the interests of these Baha'i institutions will have, sooner or later, to face this searching question: "Where and how does this Order established by Baha'u'llah, which to outward seeming is but a replica of the institutions established in Christianity and IsUm, differ from them? 

 Are not the twin institutions of the House of Justice and of the Guardianship, the institution of the Hands of the Cause of God, the institution of the national and local Assemblies, the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar but different names for the institutions of the Papacy and the Caliphate, with all their attending ecclesiastical orders which the Christians uphold and advocate? What can possibly be the agency that can safeguard these Baha'i institutions, so strikingly resemblant,  in some of their features, to those which have been reared by the Fathers of the Church and the Apostles of Muliam-mad, from witnessing the deterioration in character, the breach of unity, and the extinction of influence, which have befallen all organized religious hierarchies? 

 Why should they not eventually suffer the same fate that has overtaken the institutions which the successors of Christ and Mu-bammad  have reared?" 

 Upon the answer given to these challenging  questions will, in a great measure, depend the success of the efforts which believers in every land are now exerting for the establishment of God's kingdom upon the earth. Few will fail to recognize that the Spirit breathed by Baha'u'llah upon the world, and which is manifesting itself with varying  degrees of intensity through the efforts consciously displayed by His avowed supporters and indirectly through certain humanitarian  organizations, can never permeate  and exercise an abiding influence upon mankind unless and until it incarnates itself in a visible Order, which would bear its name, wholly identify itself with His principles, and function in conformity with His laws. That Baha'u'llah in His Book of Aqdas, and later tAbdu'1-BahA in 

His Will                   

 — a document which confirms, supplements, and correlates the provisions of the 

Aqdas                      

 — have set forth in their entirety those essential elements for the constitution of the world Baha'i Commonwealth, no one who has read them will deny. According to these divinely-ordained administrative principles,


<p217>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 217

  the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah's — tbe Ark of human salvation — must needs be modelled. From them, all future blessings must flow, and upon them its inviolable authority must ultimately rest. 

 For Baha'u'llah, we should readily recognize,  has not only imbued mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit. He has not merely enunciated certain universal princi-pies,  or propounded a certain philosophy, however potent, sound and universal these may be. In addition to these He, as well as tAbdu'1-BahA after Him, have, unlike the Dispensations of the past, clearly and specifically laid down a set of Laws, established definite institutions, and provided for the essentials of a Divine Economy. These are destined to be a pattern for future society, a supreme instrument for the establishment of The Most Great Peace, and the one agency for the unification of the world, and the proclamation of the reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth. 

 Not oniy have they revealed all the directions required for the practical realization of those ideals which the Prophets of God have visualized, and which from time immemorial have inflamed  the imagination of seers and poets in every age; they have also, in unequivocal and emphatic language, appointed those twin institutions of the House of Justice and of the Guardianship as their chosen Successors, destined to apply the principles, promulgate the laws, protect the institutions,  adapt loyally and intelligently the Faith to the requirements of progressive society, and consummate the incorruptible inheritance which the Founders of the Faith have bequeathed to the world. 

 Should we look back to the past, were we to search out the Gospel and the Qur'an, we will readily recognize that neither the Christian nor the IslAmic Dispensations can offer a parallel either to the system of Divine Economy so thoroughly established by Baha'u'llah, or to the safeguards which He has provided for its preservation and advancement. Therein, I am profoundly convinced, lies the answer to those questions to which I have already referred. 

 None, I feel, will question the fact that the fundamental reason why the unity of the Church of Christ was irretrievably shattered, and its influence was in the course of time undermined was that the Edifice which the Fathers of the Church reared after the passing of His First Apostle was an Edifice that rested in nowise upon the explicit directions  of Christ Himself. 

 The authority and features of their administration were wholly inferred, and indirectly derived, with more or less justification, from certain vague and fragmentary references which they found scattered amongst His utterances as recorded in the Gospel. 

 Not one of the sacraments of the Church; not one of the rites and ceremonies which the Christian  Fathers have elaborately devised and ostentatiously observed; not one of the elements of severe discipline they rigorously imposed upon the primitive Christians; none of these reposed on the direct author-fry  of Christ, or emanated from His specific utterances. 

 Not one of these did Christ conceive, none did He specifically invest with sufficient authority to either interpret His Word, or to add to that which He had not specifically enjoined. 

 ror this reason, in later generations, voices were raised in protest against the self-ap-pointed  Authority which arrogated to itself privileges and powers which did not emanate  from the clear text of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and which constituted a grave departure from the spirit which that Gospel did inculcate. They argued with force and justification that the canons promulgated by the Councils of the Church were not divinely-appointed laws, but were merely human devices which did not even rest upon the actual utterances of Jesus. Their contention  centered around the fact that the vague and inconclusive words, addressed by Christ to Peter, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church," could never justify the extreme measures, the elaborate  ceremonials, the fettering creeds and dogmas, with which His successors have gradually burdened and obscured His Faith. Had it been possible for the Church Fathers, whose unwarranted authority was thus fiercely assailed from every side, to refute the denunciations heaped upon them by quoting specific utterances of Christ regarding  the future administration of His


<p218>
218             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Church, or the nature of the authority of His Successors, they would surely have been capable of quenching the flame of controversy, and preserving the unity of Christendom.  The Gospel, however, the only repository of the utterances of Christ, afford no such shelter to these harassed leaders of the Church, who found themselves helpless in the face of the pitiless onslaught of their enemy, and who eventually had to submit to the forces of schism which invaded their ranks. 

 In the Muhammadan Revelation, however,  although His Faith as compared with that of Christ was, so far as the administration of His Dispensation is concerned, more complete and more specific in its provisions, yet in the matter of succession it gave no written, no binding and conclusive instructions to those whose mission was to propagate  His Cause. 

 For the text of the Qur'an, the ordinances of which regarding prayer, fasting, marriage, divorce, inheritance, pilgrimage,  and the like, have after the revo-hation of thirteen hundred years remained intact and operative, gives no definite guidance regarding the Law of Succession, the source of all the dissensions, the controversies,  and schisms which have dismembered and discredited Isl4m. 

 Not so with the Revelation of Baha'u'llah.  Unlike the Dispensation of Christ, unlike the Dispensation of Muhammad, unLike  all the Dispensations of the past, the apostles of Baha'u'llah in every land, wherever  they labor and toil, have before them in clear, in unequivocal and emphatic language, all the laws, the regulations, the principles, the institutions, the guidance, they require for the prosecution and consummation  of their task. Both in the administrative provisions of the Baha Dispensation,  and in the matter of succession, as embodied in the twin institutions of the House of Justice and of the Guardianship, the followers of Baha'u'llah can summon to their aid such irrefutable evidences of Divine Guidance that none can resist, that none can belittle or ignore. 

 Therein lies the distinguishing feature of the Baha'i Revelation. 

 Therein lies the strength of the unity of the Faith, of the validity of a Revelation that claims not to destroy or belittle  previous Revelations, but to connect, unify and fulfill them. 

 We should also bear in mind that the distinguishing character of the Baha'i Revelation  does not consist solely in the completeness and unquestionable validity of the Dispensation which the teachings of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-.Bah& have established. Its excellence lies also in the fact that those elements which in past Dispensations have, without the least authority from their Founders, been a source of corruption and of incalculable harm to the Faith of God, been strictly excluded by the clear text of Baha'u'llah's writings. Those unwarranted practices, in connection with the sacrament of baptism, of communion, of confession of sins, of asceticism, of priestly domination, of elaborate ceremonials, of holy war and of polygamy, have one and all been rigidly suppressed by the Pen of Baha'u'llah, whilst the rigidity and rigor of certain observances, such as fasting, and which are necessary to the devotional life of the individual, have been considerably abated. 

 Dear friends! Feeble though our Faith may now appear in the eyes of men, who either denounce it as an offshoot of IsUm, or contemptuously ignore it as one more of those obscure sects that abound in the West, this priceless gem of Divine Revelation, now still in its embryonic state, shall evolve within the shell of His law, and shall forge ahead, undivided and unimpaired, till it embraces the whole of mankind. 

 Only those who have already recognized the supreme station of Baha'u'llah, only those whose hearts have been touched by His love, and have become familiar with the potency of His spirit, can adequately appreciate the value of this Divine Economy — His inestimable  gift to mankind.

THE    WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH 219

            THE GOAL OF A NEW WORLD ORDER

  HE inexorable nirnrcb of recent events has carried humanity so near to the goal foreshadowed by Baha'u'llah that no responsible  follower of His Faith, viewing on all sides the distressing evidences of the world's travail, can remain unmoved at the thought of its approaching deliverance. 

 It would not seem inappropriate, at a time when we are commemorating the world over, the termination of the first decade since CAbd~1Bh~~ sudden re —  moval from our midst, to ponder, in the light of the teachings bequeathed by Him to the world, such events as have tended to hasten the gradual emergence of the World Order anticipated by Baha'u'llah. 

 Ten years ago, this very day, there flashed upon the world the news of the passing of Him Who alone, through the ennobling influence  of His love, strength and wisdom, could have proved its stay and solace in the many afflictions it was destined to suffer. 

 How well we, the little band of His avowed supporters who lay claim to have recognized the Light that shone within Him, can still remember His repeated allusions,  in the evening of His earthly life, to the tribulation and turmoil with which an unregenerate humanity was to be increasingly afflicted. How poignantly some of us can recall His pregnant remarks, in the presence of the pilgrims and visitors who thronged I-us doors on the morrow of the jubilant celebrations that greeted the termination  of the World War — a war, which by the horrors it evoked, the losses it entailed and the complications it engendered, was destined to exert so far-reaching an influence  on the fortunes of mankind. How serenely, yet how powerfully, He stressed the cruel deception which a Pact, hailed by peoples and nations as the embodiment of triumphant justice and the unfailing instrument  of an abiding peace, held in store for an unrepentant humanity. 

 ~Teace, Peace," how often we heard Him remark, erthe lips of potentates and peoples unceasingly proclaim,  whereas the fire of unquenched hatreds still sinoulders in their hearts." How often we heard Him raise His voice, 'November 28, 1921. 

 whilst the tumult of triumphant enthusiasm  was still at its height and long before the faintest misgivings could have been felt or expressed, confidently declaring that the Document, extolled as the Charter of a liberated humanity, contained within itself seeds of such bitter deception as would further enslave the world. How abundant are now the evidences that attest the perspicacity of His unerring judgment! 

 Ten years of unceasing turmoil, so laden with anguish, so fraught with incalculable consequences to the future of civilization, have brought the world to the verge of a calamity too awful to contemplate. 

 Sad indeed is the contrast between the manifestations of confident enthusiasm in which the Plenipotentiarics at Versailles so freely indulged  and the cry of unconcealed distress which victors and vanquished alike are now raising in the hour of bitter delusion. 

 Neither the force which the Framers and Guarantors of the Peace Treaties have mustered,  nor the Lofty ideals which originally animated the Author of the Covenant of the League of Nations, have proved a sufficient bulwark against the forces of internal  disruption with which a structure so laboriously contrived had been consistently assailed. 

 Neither the provisions of the socalled  Settlement which the victorious Powers  have sought to impose, nor the machinery of an institution which America's illustrious and farseeing President had conceived,  have proved, either in conception or practice, adequate instruments to ensure the integrity of the Order they had striven to establish. 

 r!The ills from which the world now suffers," wrote cAbdu~1~BahA in January  1920, '"will mulfiply; the gloom which envelops it will deepen. The Balkans will remain discontented. 

 Its restlessness will increase.  The vanquished Powers will continue to agitate. They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the flame of war. Movements, newly-born and worldwide in their range, will exert their utmost effort for the advancement of their designs. The Movement of the Left 'will acquire great importance. Its influence will spread."


<p220>
220             THE BAnAl WORLD

  Economic distress, since those words were written, together with political confusion, financial upheavals, religious restlessness and racial animosities, seem to have conspired to add immeasurably to the burdens under which an impoverished, a war-weary world is groaning. Such has been the cumulative effect of these successive crises, following one another with such bewildering rapidity, that the very foundations of society are trembling. The world, to whichever continent we turn our gaze, to however remote a region our survey may extend, is everywhere assailed by forces it can neither explain nor control. 

 Europe, hitherto regarded as the cradle of a highly-vaunted civilization, as the torchbearer  of liberty and the mainspring of the forces of world industry and commerce, stands bewildered and paralyzed at the sight of so tremendous an upheaval. Long — cherished ideals in the political no less than in the economic sphere of human activity are being severely tested under the pressure of reactionary forces on one hand and of an insidious and persistent radicalism on the other. 

 From the heart of Asia distant rumblings,  ominous and insistent, portend the steady onslaught of a creed which, by its negation of God, His Laws and Principles, threatens to disrupt the foundations of human society. The clamor of a nascent nationalism, coupled with a recrudescence of skepticism and unbelief, come as added misfortunes to a continent hitherto regarded  as the symbol of agelong stability and undisturbed resignation. 

 From darkest Africa the first stirrings of a conscious and determined revolt against the aims and methods of political and economic imperialism can be increasingly discerned, adding their share to the growing vicissitudes of a troubled age. Not even America, which until very recently prided itself on its traditional policy of aloofness and the selfcontained  character of its economy, the invulnerability of its institutions and the evidences of its growing prosperity and prestige, has been able to resist the impelling forces that have swept her into the vortex of an economic hurricane that now threatens to impair the basis of her own industrial  and economic life. Even faraway Australia, which, owing to its remoteness from the storm-centers of Europe, would have been expected to be immune from the trials and torments of an ailing continent, has been caught in this whirlpool of passion and strife, impotent to extricate herself from their ensnaring influence. 

 Never indeed have there been such widespread and basic upheavals, whether in the social, economic or political spheres of human  activity as those now going on in different  parts of the world. Never have there been so many and varied sources of danger as those that now threaten the structure of society. 

 The following words of Baha'u'llah  are indeed significant as we pause to reflect upon the present state of a strangely disordered world: "How long will humanity persist in its waywardness? How long will injustice continue? 

 Flow long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men? 

 How long will discord agitate the face of society? The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is daily increasing. 

 The signs of impending convulsions  and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch  as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably defective.~~ The disquieting influence of over thirty million souls living under minority conditions  throughout the continent of Europe; the vast and ever-swelling army of the unemployed with its crushing burden and demoralizing  influence on governments and peoples; the wicked, unbridled race of armaments  swallowing an ever-increasing share of the substance of already impoverished nations; the utter demoralization from which the international financial markets are now increasingly suffering; the onslaught  of secularism invading what has hitherto been regarded as the impregnable strongholds of Christian and Muslim orthodoxy  — these stand out as the gravest symptoms that bode ill for the future stability of the structure of modern civilization. Little wonder if one of Europe's pre~minent thinkers, honored for his wisdom and restraint, should have been forced to make so bold an assertion: "The world is passing through the gravest crisis in the history of civilization." 

 ~~NVe stand," writes another,


<p221>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                221

  tbefore either a world catastrophe, or perhaps before the dawn of a greater era of truth and wisdom." 

 ~tIt is in such times," he adds, ~~that religions have perished and are born." 

 Might we not already discern, as we scan the political horizon, the alignment of those forces that are dividing afresh the continent of Europe into camps of potential combatants,  determined upon a contest that may mark, unlike the last war, the end of an epoch, a vast epoch, in the history of human evolution? Are we, the privileged custodians of a priceless raith, called upon to witness a cataclysmical change, politically as fundamental and spiritually as beneficent as that which precipitated the fall of the Roman Empire in the 'West? Might it not happen — every vigilant adherent of the Faith of Baha'u'llah might well pause to reflect  — that out of this world eruption there may stream forces of such spiritual energy as shall recall, nay eclipse, the splendor of those signs and wonders that accompanied the establishment of the Faith of Jesus Christ? Might there not emerge out of the agony of a shaken world a religious revival of such scope and power as to even transcend  the potency of those world-directing forces with which the Religions of the Past have, at fixed intervals and according to an inscrutable Wisdom, revived the fortunes of declining ages and peoples? 

 Might not the bankruptcy of this present, this highly-vaunted  materialistic civilization, in itself clear away the choking weeds that now hinder the unfoldment and future efflorescence of God's struggling raith? 

  Let Baha'u'llah Himself    

 shed the illumination of His words upon our path as we steer our course amid the pitfalls and miser-'Cs  of this troubled age. More than fifty years ago, in a world far removed from the ills and trials that now torment it, there flowed from His Pen these prophetic words: "The world is in travail and its agitation waxeth day by day. Its face is turned towards waywardness and unbelief. Such shall be its plight that to disclose it now would not be meet and seemly. Its perversity  will long continue. 

 And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake. Then and oniy then will the Divine Standard be unfurled and the Nightingale of Paradise warble its melody." 
   Dearly beloved  friends!  

 Humanity, whether viewed in the light of man's individual  conduct or in the existing relationships between organized communities and nations, has, alas, strayed too far and suffered too great a decline to be redeemed through the unaided efforts of the best among its recognized rulers and statesmen — however disinterested their motives, however  concerted their action, however unsparing  in their zeal and devotion to its cause. 

 No scheme which the calculations of the highest statesmanship may yet devise, no doctrine which the most distinguished exponents of economic theory may hope to advance, no principle which the most ardent of moralists may strive to inculcate, can provide, in the last resort, adequate foundations upon which the future of a distracted world can be built. No appeal for mutual tolerance which the worldly-wise  might raise, however compelling and insistent, can calm its passions or help restore its vigor. Nor would any general scheme of mere organized international cooperation,  in whatever sphere of human activity, however ingenious in conception or extensive in scope, succeed in removing the root cause of the evil that has so rudely upset the equilibrium of present day society. Not even, I venture to assert, would the very act of devising the machinery required for the political and economic unification of the world — a principle that has been increasingly advocated in recent times —  provide in itself the antidote against the poison that is steadily undermining the vigor of organized peoples and nations. 

 What else, might we not confidently affirm,  but the unreserved acceptance of the Divine Program enunciated, with such simplicity  and force as far back as sixty years ago, by Baha'u'llah, embodying in its essen-dais God's divinely appointed scheme for the unification of mankind in this age, coupled with an indomitable conviction in the unfailing efficacy of each and all of its provisions, is eventually capable of withstanding  the forces of internal disintegration


<p222>
222             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  which, if unchecked, must needs continue to eat into the vitals of a despairing society. It is towards this goal — the goal of a new World Order, Divine in origin, all-embrac--ing in scope, equitable in principle, challenging in its features — that a harassed humanity  must strive. 

 To claim to have grasped all the implica-dons  of Baha'u'llah's prodigious scheme for worldwide human solidarity, or to have fathomed its import, would be presumptuous on the part of even the declared supporters  of His Faith. To attempt to visualize  it in all its possibilities, to estimate its future benefits, to picture its glory, would be premature at even so advanced a stage in the evolution of mankind. 

 All we can reasonably venture to attempt is to strive to obtain a glimpse of the first streaks of the promised Dawn that must, in the fulness of time, chase away the gloom that has encircled humanity. All we can do is to point out, in their broadest outlines, what appears to us to be the guiding principles  underlying the World Order of Baha'u'llah, as amplified and enunciated by tAbdu'1-Bahi, the Center of His Covenant with all mankind and the appointed 

Interpreter  and Expounder
of His Word.               

 That the unrest and suffering afflicting the mass of mankind are in no small measure  the direct consequences of the World War and are attributable to the unwisdom and shortsightedness of the framers of the Peace Treaties oniy a biased mind can refuse  to admit. That the financial obligations contracted in the course of the war, as well as the imposition of a staggering burden of reparations upon the vanquished, have, to a very great extent, been responsible  for the maldistribution and consequent shortage of the world's monetary gold supply,  which in turn has, to a very great measure, accentuated the phenomenal fall in prices and thereby relentlessly increased the burdens of impoverished countries, no impartial mind would question. 

 That intergovernmental debts have imposed a severe strain on the masses of the people in Europe, have upset the equilibrium of national budgets, have crippled national industries, and led to an increase in the number of the unemployed, is no less apparent to an prejudiced observer. That the spirit of vindictiveness, of suspicion, of fear and rivalry, engendered by the war, and which the provisions  of the Peace Treaties have served to perpetuate and foster, has led to an enormous increase of national competitive armaments, involving during the last year the aggregate expenditure of no less than a thousand million pounds, which in turn has accentuated the effects of the worldwide  depression, is a truth that even the most superficial observer will readily admit. That a narrow and brutal nationalism, which the postwar theory of self-determi-nation  has served to reinforce, has been chiefly responsible for the policy of high and prohibitive tariffs, so injurious to the. healthy flow of international trade and to the mechanism of international finance, is a fact which few would venture to dispute. 

 It would be idle, however, to contend that the war, with all the losses it involved, the passions it aroused and the grievances it left behind, has solely been responsible for the unprecedented confusion into which almost every section of the civilized world is plunged at present. 

 Is it not a fact —  and this is the central idea I desire to emphasize  — that the fundamental cause of this world unrest is attributable, not so much to the consequences of what must sooner or later come to be regarded as a transitory dislocation in the affairs of a continually changing world, but rather to the failure of those into whose hands the immediate destinies  of peoples and nations have been committed,  to adjust their systems of economic and political institutions to the imperative needs of a fast evolving age? 

 Are not these intermittent crises that convulse presentday  society due primarily to the lamentable inability of the world's recognized leaders to read aright the signs of the times, to rid themselves once for all of their preconceived ideas and fettering creeds, and to reshape the machinery of their respective governments according to those standards that are implicit in Baha'u'llah's supreme declaration of the Oneness of Mankind —  the chief and distinguishing feature of the Faith He proclaimed? For the principle of the Oneness of Mankind, the cornerstone of Baha'u'llah's world-embracing dominion,


<p223>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 223

  implies nothing more or less than the enforcement of His scheme for the unification of the world — the scheme to which we have already referred. CCIn every Dispensation," writes cAbdu~1~BaM, "the light of Divine Guidance has been focussed upon one central  theme    In this wondrous Revelation, this glorious century, the foundation of the Faith of God and the distinguishing feature of His Law is the consciousness of the Oneness  of Mankind." 

 How pathetic indeed are the efforts of these leaders of human institutions who, in utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are striving to adjust national processes, suited to the ancient days of selfcontained nations,  to an age which must either achieve the unity of the world, as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah, or perish, At so critical an hour in the history of civilization it behooves the leaders of all the nations of the world, great and small, whether in the East or in the W'est, whether victors or vanquished,  to give heed to the clarion call of Baha'u'llah and, thoroughly imbued with a sense of world solidarity, the sine quli non of loyalty to His Cause, arise manfully to carry out in its entirety the one remedial scheme He, the Divine Physician, has prescribed  for an ailing humanity. Let them discard, once for all, every preconceived idea, every national prejudice, and give heed to the sublime counsel of tAbdu'1 — Baha, the authorized Expounder of His teachings. You can best serve your country, was 'Abdu'l-Baha's rejoinder to a high official in the service of the federal government of the United States of America, who had questioned Him as to the best manner in which he could promote the interests of his government and people, if you strive, in your capacity as a citizen of the world, to assist in the eventual application of the principle of federalism underlying the government  of your own country to the relationships now existing between the peoples and nations of the world.

 Forces of Civilization"), tAbdu'1-Bahi's outstanding contribution to the future reorganization of the world, we read the following: ccTr civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost heart of the world whenever  a certain number of its distinguished and high-minded sovereigns  —  the shining exemplars of devotion and determination —  shall, for the good and happiness of all mankind,  arise, with firm resolve and clear vision,  to establish the Cause of Universal Peace. 

 They must make the Cause of Peace the object of general consultation, and seek by every means in their power to establish a Union of the nations of the world. They must conclude a binding treaty and estab-fish  a covenant, the provisions of which shall be sound, inviolable and definite. They must proclaim it to all the world and obtain  for it the sanction of all the human race, This supreme and noble undertaking — the real source of the peace and wellbeing of all the world — should be regarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth, All the forces of humanity must be mobilized to ensure the stability and permanence of this Most Great Covenant, In this all-embracing pact the limits and frontiers of each and every nation should be clearly fixed, the principles underlying the relations of governments towards one another definitely laid down, and all internationaL agreements and obligations ascertained, In like manner, the size of the armaments of every government should be strictly limited, for if the preparations for war and the military forces of any nation should be allowed to increase, they will arouse the suspicion of others. The fundamental principle underlying this solemn Pact should be so fixed that if any government later violate any one of its provisions, all the governments on earth should arise to reduce it to utter submission,  nay the human race as a whole should resolve, with every power at its disposal, to destroy that government, Should this greatest of all remedies be applied to the sick body of the world, it will assuredly recover  from its ills and will remain eternally safe and secure." 

 "A few," He further adds, cCunaware of the power latent in human endeavor, consider  this matter as highly impracticable, nay even beyond the scope of man's utmost efforts. 

 Such is not the case, however. On the contrary, thanks to the unfailing grace of God, the lovingkindness of His favored

  ones, the endeavors of unrivalled wise and capable souls, and the thoughts and ideas of the peerless leaders of this age, nothing whatsoever can be regarded as unattainable. Endeavour, ceaseless endeavour, is required. Nothing short of an indomitable determination can possibly achieve it. Many a cause past ages have regarded as purely visionary, yet in this day have become most easy and practicable. 

 Why should this most great and lofty cause — the daystar of the firmament of true civilization and the cause of the glory, the advancement, the wellbeing and the success of all humanity — be regarded as impossible of achievement? 

 Surely the day will come when its beauteous light shall shed illumination upon the assemblage of man. 

 In one of His Tablets tAbdu'1 — Baha, elucidating further His noble theme, reveals the following: "In cycles gone by, though harmony was established, yet, owing to the absence of means, the unity of all mankind could not have been achieved. Continents remained widely divided, nay even among the peoples of one and the same continent association and interchange of thought were well nigh impossible. Consequently intercourse, understanding and unity amongst all the peoples  and kindreds of the earth were unat —  tamable. 

 In this day, however, means of communication have multiplied, and the five continents of the earth have virtually merged into one. In like manner all the members of the human family, whether peoples or governments, cities or villages, have become increasingly interdependent. For none is self-sufficiency any longer possible, inasmuch as political ties unite all peoples and nations, and the bonds of trade and industry, of agriculture and education, are being strengthened every day. Hence the unity of all mankind can in this day be achieved. Verily this is none other but one of the wonders of this wondrous age, this glorious century. Of this past ages have been deprived, for this century — the century of light — has been endowed with unique and unprecedented glory, power and illumination. 

 Hence the miraculous unfolding of a fresh marvel every day. Eventually it will be seen how bright its candles will burn in the assemblage of man. 

 "Behold how its light is now dawning upon the world's darkened horizon. 

 The first candle is unity in the political realm, the early glimmerings of which can now be discerned, The second candle is unity of thought in world undertakings, the consummation of which will ere long be witnessed.  The third candle is unity in freedom which will surely come to pass. The fourth candle is unity in religion which is the cornerstone of the foundation itself, and which, by the power of God, will be revealed in all its splendor. 

 The fifth candle is the unity of nations — a unity which in this century will be securely established, causing all the peoples of the world to regard  themselves as citizens of one common fatherland. 

 The sixth candle is unity of races, making of all that dwell on earth peoples and kindreds of one race. 

 The seventh  candle is unity of language, that is, the choice of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and converse. Each and every one of these will inevitably come to pass, inasmuch as the power of the Kingdom of God will aid and assist in their realization." 

 Over sixty years ago, in His Tablet to Queen Victoria, Baha'u'llah, addressing "the concourse of the rulers of the earth," revealed  the following: CcTk ye counsel together, and let your concern be only for that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof. 

 Regard the world as the human  body which though created whole and perfect has been afflicted, through divers causes, with grave ills and maladies. Not for one day did it rest, nay its sicknesses waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment  of unskilled physicians who have spurred on the steed of their worldly desires  and have erred grievously. And, if at one time, through the care of an able physician, a member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before. 

 Thus informeth you the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 

 That which the Lord bath ordained  as a sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one urn


<p225>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH           225

  versa1 Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, all-powerful and inspired Physician. 

 This verily is the truth, and all else naught but error. 

 In a further passage Baha'u'llah adds these words: ~tWe see you adding every year unto your expenditures and laying the burden thereof on the people whom ye rule; this verily is naught but grievous injustice. Fear the sighs and tears of this wronged One, and burden not your peopies beyond that which they can endure. Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need armaments no more save in a measure to safeguard your territories and dominions. Be united, 0 concourse of the sovereigns of the world, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you and your peoples find rest. 

 Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice." 

 What else could these weighty words signify if they did not point to the inevitable curtailment of unfettered national sovereignty  as an indispensable preliminary to the formation of the future Commonwealth of all the nations of the world? Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in whose favor all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose  taxation and all rights to maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining  internal order within their respective dorninions. Such a state will have to include within its orbit an international executive  adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the commonwealth; a world parliament whose members shall be elected by the peopie in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed  by their respective governments; and a supreme tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect even in such cases where the parties concerned did not voiun-tarily  agree to submit their case to its consideration. 

 A world community in which all economic barriers will have been permanently demolished and the interdependence of Capital and Labor definitely recognized; in which the clamor of religious fanaticism and strife will have been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of international law — the product  of the considered judgment of the world's federated representatives  —  shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive intervention of the combined forces of the federated units; and finally a world community in which the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world citizenship — such indeed, appears, in its broadest outline, the Order anticipated by Baha'u'llah, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the fairest fruit of a slowly maturing age. 

 "The Tabernacle of Unity," Baha'u'llah proclaims in His message to all mankind, "has been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Of one tree are all ye the fruit and of one bough the leaves. 

 The world is but one country and mankind its citizens. 

 Let not a man glory in that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his kind." 

 Let there be no misgivings as to the animating  purpose of the worldwide Law of Baha'u'llah. Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society,  it seeks to broaden its basis, to remould  its institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an everchanging world. It can conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine essential ioy-alties. 

 Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men s hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language and tradition,  of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human race. It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive centralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uni


<p226>
226             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  formity on the other. 

 Its watchword is unity in diversity such as Abdu'l-Baha Himself has explained: "Consider the flowers of a garden. Though differing in kind, color, form and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of one spring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one sun, this diversity increaseth their charm and addeth unto their beauty. How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers  and plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruit, the branches and the trees of that garden were all of the same shape and color! Diversity of hues, form and shape enricheth and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect thereof. In like manner, when divers shades of thought, temperament, and character, are brought together under the power and influence of one central agency, the beauty and glory of human perfection will be revealed and made manifest. Naught but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing the divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas and convictions of the children of men. 

 The call of Baha'u'llah is primarily directed against all forms of provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If long-cher-ished ideals and time-honoured institutions, if certain social assumptions and religious formulx have ceased to promote the welfare  of the generality of mankind, if they no longer administer to the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why should these, in a world sublect to the immutable  law of change and decay, be exempt  from the deterioration that must needs overtake every human institution? For legal standards, political and economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any particular law or doctrine. 
   Let there be no mistake.  

 The principle of the Oneness of Mankind — the pivot round which all the teachings of Bah6~ 'u'Ilih revolve — is no mere outburst of igno rant emotionalism or an expression of vague and pious hope. Its appeal is not to be merely identified with a reawakening of the spirit of brotherhood and goodwill among men, nor does it aim soieiy at the fostering of harmonious cooperation among individual peoples and nations. 

 Its implications  are deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of old were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable not oniy to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of those essential relationships that must bind all the states and nations as members of one human f am-ily.  It does not constitute merely the enunciation of an ideal, but stands inseparably  associated with an institution adequate to embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and perpetuate its influence. 

 It implies an organic change in the structure of presentday society, a change such as the world has not yet experienced. 

 It constitutes  a challenge, at once bold and universal, to outworn shibboleths of national creeds — creeds that have had their day and which must, in the ordinary course of events as shaped and controlled by Providence, give way to a new gospel, fundamentally different  from, and infinitely superior to, what the world has already conceived. 

 lit calls for no iess than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world — a world organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated units. 

 It represents the consummation of human  evolution — an evolution that has had its earliest beginnings in the birth of family life, its subsequent development in the achievement of tribal solidarity, leading in turn to the constitution of the city-state, and expanding later into the institution of independent and sovereign nations. 

 The principle of the Oneness of Mankind,  as proclaimed by Baha'u'llah, carries with it, no more and no less, than a solemn assertion that attainment to this final stage in this stupendous evolution is not only necessary but inevitable, that its realization is fast approaching, and that nothing short


<p227>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                              227

  of a power that is born of God can succeed in establishing it. So marvellous a conception finds its earliest  manifestations in the efforts consciously exerted and the modest beginnings already achieved by the declared adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah who, conscious of the sublimity of their calling and initiated into the ennobling principles of His Administration, are forging ahead to establish His Kingdom on this earth. It has its indirect manifestations in the gradual diffusion of the spirit of world solidarity which is spontaneously arising out of the welter of a disorganized  society. 

 It would be stimulating to follow the history of the growth and development of this lofty conception which must increasingly engage the attention of the responsible custodians of the destinies of peoples and nations. To the states and principalities just emerging from the welter of the great Napoleonic upheaval, whose chief preoccupation  was either to recover their rights to an independent existence or to achieve their national unity, the conception of world solidarity seemed not oniy remote but inconceivable. 

 It was not until the forces of nationalism had succeeded in overthrowing the foundations of the Holy Alliance that had sought to curb their rising power, that the possibility of a world order, transcending  in its range the political institutions  these nations had established, came to be seriously entertained. 

 It was not until after the World SMar that these exponents of arrogant nationalism came to regard such an order as the object of a pernicious doctrine tending to sap that essential loyalty upon which the continued existence of their national life depended. 

 With a vigor that recalled the energy with which the members of the Holy Alliance sought to stifle the spirit of a rising nationalism among the peoples liberated from the Napoleonic yoke, those champions of an unfettered national sovereignty, in their turn, have labored and are still laboring to discredit principles upon which their own salvation must ultimately  depend. 

 The fierce opposition which greeted the abortive scheme of the Geneva Protocol; the ridicule poured upon the proposal for a 

United States of Europe    

 which was subse-quendy advanced, and the failure of the general scheme for the economic union of Europe, may appear as setbacks to the efforts which a handftil of foresighted people are earnestly exerting to advance this noble ideal. 

 And yet, are we not justified in deriving  fresh encouragement when we observe  that the very consideration of such proposals is in itself an evidence of their steady growth in the minds and hearts of men. In the organized attempts that are being made to discredit so exalted a conception are we not witnessing the repetition, on a larger scale, of those stirring struggles and fierce controversies that preceded the birth, and assisted in the reconstruction, of the unified nations of the "West? 
     To take but one instance.  

 How confident were the assertions made in the days preceding  the unification of the states of the North American continent regarding the insuperable barriers that stood in the way of their ultimate federation! 

 "Was it not widely and emphatically declared that the conflicting interests, the mutual distrust, the differences of government and habit that divided the states were such as no force, whether spiritual or temporal, could ever hope to harmonize or control? 

 And yet how different were the conditions prevailing a hundred and fifty years ago from those that characterize presentday society! 

 It would indeed be no exaggeration to say that the absence of those facilities which modern scientific progress has placed at the service of humanity in our time made of the problem of welding the American states into a single federation a task infinitely complex than that which confronts a divided humanity in its efforts to achieve the unification of all mankind. 

 Who knows that for so exalted a conceptiOn to take shape a suffering more intense than any it has yet experienced will have to be inflicted upon humanity? Could anything  less than the fire of a civil war with all its violence and vicissitudes — a war that nearly rent the great American Republic —  have welded the states, not oniy into a Union of independent units, but into a Nation, in spite of all the ethnic differences that characterized its component parts? 

That


<p228>
228             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  so fundamental a revolution, involving such far-reaching changes in the structure of society,  can be achieved through the ordinary processes of diplomacy and education seems highly improbable. 

 We have but to turn our gaze to humanity's bloodstained history to realize that nothing short of intense mental  as well as physical agony has been able to precipitate those epochmaking changes that constitute the greatest landmarks in the history of human civilization. 

 Great and far-reaching as have been those changes in the past, they cannot but appear, when viewed in their proper perspective, except as subsidiary adjustments preluding that transformation of unparalleled majesty and scope which humanity is in this age bound to undergo. That the forces of a world catastrophe can alone precipitate such a new phase of human thought is, alas, be-coining increasingly apparent. 

 That nothing short of the fire of a severe ordeal, unparalleled in its intensity, can fuse and weld the discordant entities, that constitute the elements  of presentday civilization, into the integral components of the world Commonwealth  of the future is a truth which future events will increasingly demonstrate. 

 The prophetic voice of Baha'u'llah warning,  in the concluding passages of the Hidden  Words, "the peoples of the world" that an unforeseen calamity is following them and that grievous retribution awaiteth them" throws indeed a lurid light upon the immediate  fortunes of sorrowing humanity. Nothing but a fiery ordeal, out of which humanity will emerge, chastened and prepared,  can succeed in implanting that sense of responsibility which the leaders of a newborn age must arise to shoulder. 

 I would again direct your attention to those ominous words of Baha'u'llah which I have already quoted: "And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake." 

 Has not tAbdu'I-BaM Himself asserted in unequivocal language that ttanother war, fiercer than the last, will assuredly break out"? 

 Upon the consummation of this colossal, this unspeakably glorious enterprise — an enterprise that baffled the resources of Roman statesmanship and which Napoleon's desperate efforts failed to achieve — will depend the ultimate realization of that millennium of which poets of all ages have sung and seers have long dreamed. Upon it will depend  the fulfillment of the prophecies uttered by the Prophets of old when swords shall be beaten into ploughshares and the lion and the lamb lie down together. It alone can usher in the Kingdom of the Heavenly Father as anticipated by the 

Faith of Jesus Christ.     

 It alone can lay the foundation  for the New World Order visualized by 

Baha'u'llah — a World Order  

 that shall reflect, however dimly, upon this earthly plane, the ineffable splendors of the AbM Kingdom. 
  One word more in conclusion.

 The proclamation  of the Oneness of Mankind — the head cornerstone of Baha'u'llah's all-em-bracing  dominion —  can under no circumstances be compared with such expressions of pious hope as have been uttered in the past. His is not merely a call which He raised, alone and unaided, in the face of the relentless and combined opposition of two of the most powerful Oriental potentates of His day — while Himself an exile and prisoner  in their hands. It implies at once a warning and a promise — a warning that in it lies the soic means for the salvation of a greatly suffering world, a promise that its realization is at hand. 

 Uttered at a time when its possibility had not yet been seriously envisaged in any part of the world, it has, by virtue of that celestial  potency with which the Spirit of Baha'u'llah  has breathed into it, come at last to be regarded, by an increasing number of thoughtful men, not oniy as an approaching possibility, but as the necessary outcome of the forces now operating in the world. 

 Surely the world, contracted and transformed  into a single highly complex organism  by the marvellous progress achieved in the realm of physical science, by the worldwide  expansion of commerce and industry, and struggling, under the pressure of world economic forces, amidst the pitfalls of a materialistic civilization, stands in dire need of a restatement of the Truth underlying all the Revelations of the past in a language suited to its essential requirements. 

And


<p229>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 229

  what voice other than that of Baha'u'llah —  the Mouthpiece of God for this age — is capable  of effecting a transformation of society as radical as that which He has already accomplished in the hearts of those men and women, so diversified and seemingly irreconcilable, who constitute the body of His declared followers throughout the world? 

 That such a mighty conception is fast budding out in the minds of men, that voices are being raised in its support, that its salient features must fast crystallize in the consciousness of those who are in authority, few indeed can doubt. That its modest beginnings have already taken shape in the worldwide Administration with which the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah stands associated oniy those whose hearts are tainted by prejudice can fail to perceive. 

 Ours, dearly-beloved coworkers, is the paramount duty to continue, with undimmed vision and unabated zeal, to assist in the final erection of that Edifice the foundations of which Baha'u'llah has laid in our hearts. Ours is the duty to derive added hope and strength from the general trend of recent events, however dark their immediate effects, and to pray with unremitting fervor  that He may hasten the approach of the realization of that Wondrous Vision which constitutes the brightest emanation of His Mind and the fairest fruit of the fairest civilization the world has yet seen. 

 Might not the hundredth anniversary 1 of the Declaration of the Faith of Baha'u'llah mark the inauguration of so vast an era in human history?

     NONPOLITICAL CHARACTER OF THE BAHA FAITH

  We stand too close to so colossal a Revelation to expect in this, the first century of its era, to arrive at a just estimate of its towering grandeur, its infinite possibilities, its transcendent beauty. 

 Small though our present numbers may be, however limited our capacities, or circumscribed our influence,  we, into whose hands so pure, so tender, so precious, a heritage has been entrusted,  should at all times strive, with unrelaxing vigilance, to abstain from any thoughts, words, or deeds, that might tend to dim its brilliance or injure its growth. 

 Dear friends: Clear and emphatic as are the instructions which our departed Master has reiterated in countless Tablets bequeathed  by Him to his followers throughout  the world, a few, owing to the restricted influence of the Cause in the West, have been purposely withheld from the body of His occidental disciples, who, despite their numerical inferiority, are now exercising such a preponderating influence in the direction  and administration of its affairs. I feel it, therefore, incumbent upon me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance of an instruction which, at the present state of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or to the West. 

And                        

 this principle is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents  of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as local or national Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 Whether it be in the publications which they initiate and supervise; or in their official and public deliberations; or in the posts they occupy and the services they render; or in the communications they address  to their fellow-disciples; or in their dealings with men of eminence and authority; or in their affiliations with kindred societies and organizations, it is, I am firmly convinced, their first and sacred obligation to abstain from any word or deed that might be construed as a violation of this vital principle. Theirs is the duty to demonstrate, on one hand, their unqualified loyalty and obedience to whatever is the considered judgment of their respective governments. 

 Let them refrain from associating them-seives, whether by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective nations,  with the policies of their governments and the schemes and programs of parties


<p230>
230             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and factions. In such controversies they should assign no blame, take no side, further no design, and identify themselves with no system prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide Fellowship which it is their aim to guard and foster. 

 Let them beware lest they allow themselves to become the tools of unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious among their countrymen. 

 Let them so shape their lives and regulate their conduct that no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery or of intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought against them. 

 Let them rise above all particularism  and partisanship, above the vain disputes, the petty calculations, the transient  passions that agitate the face, and engage the attention, of a changing world. It is their duty to strive to distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts and functions as are either diplomatic or political from those that are purely administrative in character, and which under  no circumstances are affected by the changes and chances that political activities and party government, in every land, must necessarily involve. Let them affirm their unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates 

God's immutable Purpose    
for all men.               

 It should be made unmistakably clear that such an attitude implies neither the slightest indifference to the cause and interests  of their own country, nor involves any insubordination on their part to the authority of recognized and established governments.  Nor does it constitute a repudiation of their sacred obligation to promote, in the most effective manner, the best interests of their government and people. 

 It indicates the desire cherished by every true and loyal follower of Baha'u'llah to serve, in an unselfish,  unostentatious and patriotic fashion, the highest interests of the country to which he belongs, and in a way that would entail no departure from the high standards of integrity and truthfulness associated with the teachings of His Faith.

          AMERICA AND THE MOST GREAT PEACE

  Dearly-beloved friends! 

 It is not for me, nor does it seem within the competence of any one of the present generation, to trace the exact and full history of the rise and gradual consolidation of this invincible arm, this mighty organ, of a continually advancing  Cause. It would be premature at this early stage of its evolution, to attempt an exhaustive analysis, or to arrive at a just estimate, of the impelling forces that have urged it forward to occupy so exalted a place among the various instruments which the Hand of Omnipotence has fashioned, and is now perfecting, for the execution of His divine Purpose. 

 Future historians of this mighty Revelation, endowed with pens abler than any which its presentday supporters  can claim to possess, will no doubt transmit to posterity a masterly exposition of the origins of those forces which, through a remarkable swing of the pendu lurn, have caused the administrative center of the Faith to gravitate, away from its cradle, to the shores of the American continent  and towards its very heart — the present  mainspring and chief bdwark of its fast evolving institutions. On them will devolve the task of recording the history, and of estimating the significance, of so radical a revolution in the fortunes of a siowiy maturing Faith. Theirs will be the opportunity to extol the virtues and to immortalize the memory of those men and women who have participated in its accomplishment. 

 Theirs will be the privilege of evaluating the share which each of these champion-builders of the World Order of Baha'u'llah has had in ushering in that golden Millennium, the promise of which lies enshrined in His teachings. 

 Does not the history of primitive Christianity and of the rise of IslAm, each in its


<p231>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 231

  own way, offer a striking parallel to this strange phenomenon the beginnings of which we are now witnessing in this, the first century of the Baha'i Era? Has not the Divine Impulse which gave birth to each of these great religious systems been driven, through the operation of those forces which the irresistible growth of the Faith itself had released, to seek away from the land of its birth and in more propitious climes a ready field and a more adequate medium for the incarnation of its spirit and the propagation of its cause? Have not the Asiatic churches of 

Jerusalem, of Antioch      

 and of Alexandria, consisting chiefly of those Jewish converts, whose character and temperament  inclined them to sympathize with the traditional ceremonies of the Mosaic Dispensation, been forced as they steadily declined  to recognize the growing ascendancy of their Greek and Roman brethren? Have they not been compelled to acknowledge the superior valor and the trained efficiency which have enabled these standard-bearers of the Cause of Jesus Christ to erect the symbols of His worldwide dominion on the ruins of a collapsing Empire? Has not the animating spirit of IsUm been constrained, under the pressure of similar circumstances, to abandon the inhospitable wastes of its Arabian Home, the theatre of its greatest sufferings and exploits, to yield in a distant land the fairest fruit of its siowiy maturing civilization? 

 rrFrom floe beginning of t~'me until the present day," Abdu'l-Baha Himself affirms, ~the light of Divine Revelation hath risen in the East and shed its radiance upon the W/est. The illumination thus shed hath, however, acquired in the West an extraordinary  brilliancy. 

 Consider the Faith proclaimed by Jesus. Though it first appeared in the East, yet not until its ligkt had been shed upon the West did the full measure of ils potentialities be manifest." reThe day is approaching," He, in another passage, assures us, ~~when ye shall witness how, through the splendor of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, the West will have replaced the East, radiating the light of Divine Guidance." 

 ~~In the books of the Prophets," He again asserts, ~certa~n glad-tidings are recorded which are absolutely  true and free from doubt. The East hath ever been the dawning-place of the Sun of Truth. In the East all the Prophets of God have appeared. The West hath acquired illumination from the East but in some respects the reflection of the light bath been greater in the Occident. 

 This is spe-~ cially true of Christianity. Jesus Christ appeared in Palestine and His teachings were founded in that country. Although the doors of the Kingdom were first opened in (hat land and (he bestowals of God were spread broadcast from its center, the people of the West have embraced and promulgated Christianity more fully than the leo-pie  of the 

East."                     

 Little wonder that from the same unerring  pen there should have flowed, after Abdu'l-Baha's memorable Visit to the W'est, these often-quoted words, the significance of which it would be impossible for me to overrate: ~The continent of America," He announced in a Tablet unveiling His Divine Plan to the believers residing in the NorthEastern  States of the American Republic, ~is in the eyes of the one true God the land wherein Ihe splendors of His light shall be revealed, 'where the righteous will abide and the free assemble." ~May this 

American democracy," He    

 Himself, while in America, was heard to remark, rrbe the first nation to establish the foundation, of interna~ional agreement. 

 May it be the first nation to proclaim the unity of mankind. May it be the first to unfurl the shmdard of the ~Most Great Peace.' 

 The American people are indeed worthy of being the first to build the tabernacle of the great peace and proclaim the oneness of mankind. May America become the distributing center of spiritual enlightenment and all the world receive this heavenly blessing. 

 For America has developed powers and capacities greater and more wonderful than any other nations. 

 May the inhabitants of Ibis country become like angels of heaven with faces turned continually  toward God. May all of them become servants of the omnipotent One. May they rise from their present material attainments to such a height that heavenly illumination may stream from this center to all the peoples of the world. 

 This American nation is equipped and empowered to ac-coin  push that which will adorn the pages

  of history, to become the envy of the world and be blest in both the East and the West for the triumph of its people The American continent gives signs and evidences of very great advancement. 

 Its future is even more promising, for its in flu —  ence and illumination are far-reaching. It will lead all nations spiritually." 

 Would it seem extravagant, in the light of so sublime an utterance, to expect that in the midst of so enviable a region of the earth and out of the agony and wreckage of an unprecedented crisis there should burst forth a spiritual renaissance which, as it propagates itself through the instrumentality of the American believers, will rehabilitate  the fortunes of a decadent age? It was cAbdu~1~Bah~, Himself, His most intimate associates testify, Who, on more than one occasion, intimated that the establishment of His Father's Faith in the North American  continent ranked as the most outstanding among the threefold aims which, as He conceived it, constituted the principal objective  of His ministry. 

 It was He who, in the heyday of His life and almost immediately  after His Father's ascension, conceived the idea of inaugurating His mission by enlisting the inhabitants of so promising a country under the banner of Baha'u'llah. He it was Who in His unerring wisdom and out of the abundance of His heart chose to bestow on His favored disciples, to the very last day of His life, the tokens of His unfailing  solicitude and to overwhelm them with the marks of His special favor. It was He Who, in His declining years, as soon as delivered from the shackles of a long and cruel incarceration, decided to visit the land which had remained for so many years the object of His infinite care and love. It was He Who, through the power of His pres —  ence and the charm of His utterance, infused  into the entire body of His followers those sentiments and principles which could alone sustain them amidst the trials which the very prosecution of their task would inevitably engender. Was He not, through the several functions which He exercised whilst He dwelt amongst them, whether in the laying of the cornerstone of their House of Worship, or in the Feast which He offered them and at which He chose to serve them in person, or in the emphasis which He on a more solemn occasion placed on the implications of His spiritual station — was He not, thereby, deliberately bequeathing  to them all the essentials of that spiritual heritage which He knew they would ably safeguard and by their deeds continually enrich? And finally who can doubt that in the Divine Plan which, in the evening of His life, He unveiled to their eyes He was investing them with that spiritual  primacy on which they could rely in the fulfillment of their high destiny? 
   ~O ye apostles of Baha'u'llah!"

 lie thus addresses them in one of His Tablets, rrMay my life be sacrificed for you! Behold the portals which Baha'u'llah loath opened before you! Consider how exalted and lofty is the station you are destined to attain; how unique the favors with which you have been endowed." 

 reMy thoughts," He tells them in another passage, rrare turned towards  you, and my heart leaps within me at your mention. Could ye know how my soul glows with your love, so great a hap pi —  ness would flood your hearts as to cause you to become enainoured with each other." reThe full measure of your success," He de-dares in another Tablet, rris as yet unrevealed,  its significance still unapprehended. Ere long ye wili, 'with your own eyes, witness  how brilliantly every one of you, even as a shining star, will radiate in the firma-nient  of your country the light of Divine Guidance and ivill bestow upon its people the glory of an everlasting life." f!The range of your future achievements," He once more affirms, result remains undisclosed. I fervently hope that in the near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your achievements." 

 f!T lie Al-nilgioty," He assures them, ~ will no doubt grant you the help of His grace, will invest you with the tokens of His might, and will endue your souls with the sustaining power of His holy Spirit." 

 ~~Be not concerned," He admonishes them, r?with the sindiliness of your numbers, neither be oppressed by the multitude of an unbelieving world.

  power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly established." (April 21, 1933.) 
                           
           THE BAHA'I ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER

  Dearly-beloved brethren in ~Abdu'1 — Baha With the ascension of Baha'u'llah the DayStar  of Divine guidance which, as foretold by 

Shaykh Alirnad and Siyyid 

 Ki~m, had risen in Shiriz, and, while pursuing its westward course, had mounted its zenith in Adrianople, had finally sunk below the horizon of tAkki, never to rise again ere the complete revolution of one thousand years. The setting of so effulgent an Orb brought to a definite termination the period of Divine  Revelation — the initial and most vitalizing stage in the Baha'i era. 

 Inaugurated by the BTh, culminating in Baha'u'llah, anticipated and extolled by the entire company  of the Prophets of this great prophetic cycle, this period has, except for the short interval between the Mb's martyrdom and Baha'u'llah's shaking experiences in the SiyTh-ChM of Tihrin, been characterized by almost fifty years of continuous and progressive Revelation — a period which by its duration and fecundity must be regarded as unparalleled in the entire field of the world's spiritual history. 

 The passing of Abdu'l-Baha on the other hand, marks the closing of the Heroic and Apostolic Age of this same Dispensation —  that primitive period of our Faith the splendors  of which can never be rivalled, much less be eclipsed, by the magnificence that must needs distinguish the future victories of Baha'u'llah's Revelation. ror neither the achievements of the champion-builders of the presentday institutions of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, nor the tumultuous triumphs which the heroes of its Golden Age will in the coming days succeed in winning, can measure with, or be included within the same category as, the wondrous works associated  with the names of those who have generated its very life and laid its pristine foundations. 

 That first and creative age of the Baha'i era must, by its very nature, stand above and apart from the formative period into which we have entered and the golden age destined to succeed it. cAbdu~1~BahA Who incarnates an institution  for which we can find no parallel whatsoever in any of the world's recognized religious systems, may be said to have closed the Age to which He Himself belonged and opened the one in which we are now laboring.  His Will and Testament should thus be regarded as the perpetual, the indissoluble link which the mind of Him Who is the Mystery of God has conceived in order to insure the continuity of the three ages that constitute the component parts of the Baha'i Dispensation. 

 The period in which the seed of the Faith had been siowiy germinating is thus intertwined both with the one which must witness its efflorescence and the subsequent age in which that seed will have finally yielded its golden fruit. 

 The creative energies released by the Law of Baha'u'llah, permeating and evolving within the mind of Abdu'l-Baha have, by their very impact and close interaction, given birth to an Instrument which may be viewed as the Charter of the New World Order which is at once the glory and the promise of this most great Dispensation. The Will may thus be acclaimed as the inevitable offspring resulting from that mystic intercourse between Him Who communicated  the generating influence of His divine Purpose and the One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient. 

 Being the Child of the Covenant — the Heir of both the Originator and the Interpreter of the Law of God — the Will and Testament of tAbdu~1Bah~ can no more be divorced from Him Who supplied the original and motivating impulse than from the One Who ultimately conceived it. Baha'u'llah's inscrutable purpose, we must ever bear in mind, has been so thoroughly infused into the conduct of Abdu'l-Baha, and their motives have been so closely wedded together,  that the mere attempt to dissociate the teachings of the former from any system  which the ideal Exemplar of those same teachings has established would amount to


<p234>
234             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  a repudiation of one of the most sacred and basic truths of the Faith. 

 The Administrative Order, which ever since tAbdu~1~Bah&s ascension has evolved and is taking shape under our very eyes in no fewer than forty countries of the world, may be considered as the framework of the 'Will itself, the inviolable stronghold wherein  this newborn child is being nurtured and develops. 

 This Administrative Order, as it expands and consolidates itself, will no doubt manifest the potentialities and reveal the full implications of this momentous Document — this most remarkable expression of the Will of One of the most remarkable Figures of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah. It will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency  and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate  its capacity to be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fulness of time the whole of mankind. 

 It should be noted in this connection that this 

Administrative Order      

 is fundamentally different from anything that any Prophet has previously established, inasmuch as Baha'u'llah  has Himself revealed its principles, established its institutions, appointed the person to interpret His Word and conferred the necessary authority on the body designed  to supplement and apply His legislative  ordinances. 

 Therein lies the secret of its strength, its fundamental distinction, and the guarantee against disintegration and schism. Nowhere in the sacred scriptures of any of the world's religious systems, nor even in the writings of the Inaugurator of the Baha'i Dispensation, do we find any provisions establishing a covenant or providing  for an administrative order that can compare in scope and authority with those that lie at the very basis of the 

Baha'i Dispensation.     
Has either Christianity   

 or Islirn, to take as an instance two of the most widely diffused and outstanding among the world's recognized religions, anything to offer that can measure with, or be regarded as equivalent to, either the Book of 

Baha'u'llah's  Covenant  

 or to the Will and Testament of CAbd~1Bh~? Does the text of either the Gospel or the Qur'an confer sufficient  authority upon those leaders and coun cils that have claimed the right and assumed the function of interpreting the provisions of their sacred scriptures and of administering  the affairs of their respective communities?  Could Peter, the admitted chief of the Apostles, or the Jni6m 'Au, the cousin and legitimate successor of the Prophet, produce in support of the primacy with which both had been invested written and explicit affirmations  from Christ and Muhammad that could have silenced those who either among their contemporaries or in a later age have repudiated their authority and, by their action,  precipitated the schisms that persist until the present day? Where, we may confidently  ask, in the recorded sayings of Jesus Christ, whether in the matter of succession or in the provision of a set of specific laws and clearly defined administrative ordinances,  as distinguished from purely spiritual principles, can we find anything approaching the detailed injunctions, laws and warnings that abound in the authenticated utterances of both Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-Bahi? Can any passage of the Qur'an, which in respect to its legal code, its administrative and devotional ordinances marks already a notable advance over previous  and more corrupted Revelations, be construed as placing upon an unassailable basis the undoubted authority with which Muhammad had, verbally and on several occasions, invested His successor? 

 Can the Author of the Bab Dispensation, however much He may have succeeded through the provisions of the BayAn in averting a schism as permanent and catastrophic as those that afflicted Christianity and Isltm —  can He be said to have produced instruments for the safeguarding of His faith as definite and efficacious as those which must for all time preserve the unity of the organized  followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah Alone of all the Revelations gone before it this Faith has, through the explicit directions,  the repeated warnings, the authenticated safeguards incorporated and elaborated in its teachings, succeeded in raising a structure which the bewildered followers of bankrupt and broken creeds might well approach  and critically examine, and seek, ere it is too late, the invulnerable security of its world-embracing shelter.


<p235>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 235

  No wonder that He Who through the operation of His Will has inaugurated so vast and unique an Order and Who is the Center of so mighty a Covenant should have written these words: "So finn and mighty is this Covenant that from the beginning  of time until the present day no religious Dispensation hat/a produced its like." 

 rev(Jhatsoever is latent in the innermost  of this holy cycle," He wrote during the darkest and most dangerous days of His ministry, reshall gradually appear and be made manifest, for now is but the be ginning of its growth and the days pring of the revelation of its signs." "Fear not," are His reassuring words foreshadowing the rise of the Administrative Order established by His Will, ~Jear not if this Branch be severed from this material world and cast aside its leaves; nay, the leaves thereof shall flourish, for this Branch will grow after it is cut off front this world below, it shall reach the loftiest pinnacles of glory, and it shall bear such fruits as will perfume the world with their fragrance." 

 To what cisc if not to the power and majesty which this Administrative Order — the rudiments of the future all-enfolding Baha'i Commonwealth — is destined to manifest, can these utterances of Baha'u'llah allude: ~CThe world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind's ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed." 

 The Bib Himself, in the course of His references to "Him Whom God will make manifest" anticipates the System and glorifies the World Order which the Revelation of Baha'u'llah is destined to unfold. 

 (ewe1! is it with him," is His remarkable statement in the third chapter of the Bay6.n, %vho fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Baha'u'llah  and rendereth thanks unto his Lord! For lie will assuredly be made manifest. God loath indeed irrevocably ordained it in the Baydn." 

 In the Tablets of Baha'u'llah where the institutions of the International and 1oca~ Houses of Justice are specifically designated and formally established; in the institution of the Hands of the Cause of God which first Baha'u'llah and then CAbd~1Bh~ brought into being; in the institution of both local and national Assemblies which in their embryonic stage were already functioning  in the days preceding ~Abdu'1 Baha'is ascension; in the authority with which the Author of our Faith and the Center of His Covenant have in their Tablets  chosen to confer upon them; in the institution of the Local Fund which operated  according to CAbd~1Bh~~ specific injunctions addressed to certain Assemblies in Inn; in the verses of the Kitab-i-Aqdas the implications of which clearly anticipate the institution of the Guardianship; in the explanation which cAbdu~1~BaM, in one of His Tablets, has given to, and the emphasis He has placed upon, the hereditary principle  and the law of primogeniture as having been upheld by the Prophets of the past — in these we can discern the faint glimmerings and discover the earliest intimation of the nature and working of the Administrative Order which the Will of tAbdu'1-Bahi  was at a later time destined to proclaim and formally establish. 

  An attempt, I feel, should at the present juncture be made to explain the character and functions of the twin pillars that support  this mighty Administrative 

Structure                  

 — the institutions of the Guardianship and of the 

Universal House of Justice.

 To describe  in their entirety the diverse elements that function in conjunction with these institutions is beyond the scope and purpose of this general exposition of the fundamental verities of the Faith. 

 To define with accuracy and minuteness the features, and to analyze exhaustively the nature of the relationships which, on the one hand, bind together these two fundamental organs of the Will of tAbdu'1-BahA and connect, on the other, each of them to the Author of the Faith and the Center of His Covenant  is a task which future generations will no doubt adequately fulfil. 

 My present intention is to elaborate certain salient features  of this scheme which, however close we may stand to its colossal structure, are already so clearly defined that we find it inexcusable to either misconceive or ignore.


<p236>
236             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  It should be stated, at the very outset, in clear and unambiguous language, that these twin institutions of the Administrative 

Order of Baha'u'llah       

 should be regarded as divine in origin, essential in their functiOns  and complementary in their aim and purpose. Their common, their fundamental object is to insure the continuity of that divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source of our Faith, to safeguard  the unity of its followers and to maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teachings. 

 Acting in conjunction with each other these two inseparable institutions administer its affairs, coordinate its activities,  promote its interests, execute its laws and defend its subsidiary institutions. Severally,, each operates within a clearly defined sphere of jurisdiction; each is equipped with its own attendant institutions  — instruments designed for the effective discharge of its particular responsibilities  and duties. Each exercises, within the limitations imposed upon it, its powers, its authority, its rights and prerogatives. These are neither contradictory, nor detract in the slightest degree from the position which each of these institutions occupies. Far from being incompatible or mutually destructive, they supplement each other's authority and functions, and are permanently and fundamentally united in their aims. 

 Divorced from the institution of the Guardianship the World Order of BaLk u'llTh would be mutilated and permanently deprived of that hereditary principle which, as tAbdu'1-BahA has written, has been invariably  upheld by the Law of God. rrIn all the Divine Dispensations," He states, in a Tablet addressed to a follower of the Faith in Iran, !!the eldest son hath been given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of pro phethood hat/i been his birthright." 

 Without such an institution the integrity of the Faith would be imperilled, and the stability of the entire fabric would be gravely endangered. Its prestige would suffer, the means required to enable it to take a long, an uninterrupted view over a series of generations would be completely lacking, and the necessary guidance to define  the sphere of the legislative action of its elected representatives would be totally withdrawn. 

 Severed from the no less essential institution of the Universal House of Justice this same System of the Will of Abdu'l-Baha would be paralyzed in its action and would be powerless to fill in those gaps which the Author of the Kitab-i-Aqdas has deliberately left in the body of His legislative and administrative ordinances. 

 rrHe is the Interpreter of the Word of God," tAbdu'1 — Bah4, referring to the functions of the Guardian of the Faith, asserts, using in His Will the very term which He Himself had chosen when refuting the argument of the Covenant-breakers who had challenged His right to interpret the utterances of Baha'u'llah. !After hii;s," He adds, eewill succeed the flrst-born of his lineal descendants." 

 "The mighty stronghold," He further explains, ershall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to loins who is the Guardiais of the Cause of God." 

 Nt is incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice, upon all the Agksdn, the Afndn., 

 the Hands of the Cause of God, to show their obedience, subinis-siveness  and subordination unto the Guardian  of the Cause of God." 

 Nt is incumbent upon the nseinbers of the House of Justice," Baha'u'llah, on the other hand, declares in the Eighth Leaf of the Exalted Paradise, to take counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to them. 

 God will vent> inspire them with whatsoever He ivilleth, and He verily is the Provider, the Omniscient." 

 erUntO the Most Holy Book" (the Kitab-i-Aqdas), 'Abdu'l-Baha states in His Will, "every one must turn, and all that is not expressly recorded  therein must be referred to the Universal 

House of Justice. That     

 which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the truth and the purpose of Cod Himself. Whoso doth deviate there from is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth malice, and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant." 

 Not only does tAbdu'1-BahA confirm in His Will Baha'u'llah's above-quoted state


<p237>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 237

  ment, but invests this body with the additional right and power to abrogate, according to the exigencies of time, its own enactments, as well as those of a preceding House of Justice. rrlisasmuch as the House of Justice," is His explicit statement in His Will, ~~hath power to enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book and bear upon daily transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the sante This it can do because these laws form no part of the divine explicit text." 

 Referring to both the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice we read these emphatic words: "The sacred and youthful Branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and established are both under the care and protection of the Abhd Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (the Rib) (may my life be offered up for then; both). 

 Whatsoever they decide is of God." 

 From these statements it is made indubitably  clear and evident that the Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that the Universal House of Justice has been invested  with the function of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings.  The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pro-flounce  upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws and ordinances as Baha'u'llah has not expressly revealed. 

 Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted  authority with which both have been divinely invested. 

 Though the Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head of so august a body he can never, even temporarily, assume the right of exclusive legislation. He cannot override the decision of the majority of his fellow-members, but is bound to insist upon a reconsideration by them of any enactment he conscientiously believes to conflict with the Meaning and to depart from the spirit of Baha'u'llah's revealed utterances. He interprets what has been specifically revealed, and cannot legislate except in his capacity as member of the Universal House of Justice. He is debarred from laying down independently the constitution that must govern the organized  activities of his fellow-members, and from exercising his influence in a manner  that would encroach upon the liberty of those whose sacred right is to elect the body of his collaborators. 

 It should be borne in mind that the institution  of the Guardianship has been anticipated by ~Abd'1Bh' in an allusion He made in a Tablet addressed, long before His own ascension, to three of His friends in ir4n. To their question as to whether there would be any person to whom ~i11 the Baha'is would be called upon to turn after His ascension He made the following reply: ~As to the question ye have asked me, know verily that this is a well-guarded secret. It is even as a gem concealed within, its shell. That it will be revealed is predestined. 

 The time will come when its light will a~ftear, when its evidences will be made manifest, and its secrets unravelled." 
    Dearly-beloved friends!    

 Exalted as is the position and vital as is the function of the institution of the Guardianship in the Administrative Order of Baha'u'llah, and staggering as must be the weight of responsibility which it carries, its importance must, whatever be the language of the 'Will, be in no wise overemphasized. 

 The Guardian of the Faith must not under any circumstances, and whatever his merits or his achievements, be exalted to the rank that will make him a co-sharer with Abdu'l-Baha in the unique position which the Center of the Covenant occupies —  much iess to the station exclusively ordained for the Manifestation of God. So grave a departure from the established tenets of our Faith is nothing short of open blasphemy. 

 As I have already stated, in the course of my references to tAbdu~1 Baha'is station, however great ~he gulf that separates Him from the Aurhor of a Divine Revelation it can never measure with the distance that stands between Him Who is the 

Center of Baha'u'llah's    

 Covenant and the Guardians who are its chosen ministers.


<p238>
238             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  There is a far, far greater distance separating  the Guardian from the Center of the Covenant than there is between the Center of the Covenant and its 

Author.                    

 No Guardian of the Faith, I feel in my solemn duty to place on record, can ever claim to be the perfect exemplar of the teachings of Baha'u'llah or the stainless mirror that reflects His light. Though overshadowed by the unfailing, the unerring  protection of Baha'u'llah and of the Bib, and however much he may share with tAbdu'1-Bah4 the right and obligation to interpret tbe Baha'i teachings, he remains essentially human and cannot, if he wishes to remain faithful to his trust, arrogate to himself, under any pretence whatsoever, the rights, the privileges and prerogatives which Baha'u'llah has chosen to confer upon His Son. 

 In the light of this truth to pray to the Guardian of the Faith, to address him as lord and master, to designate him as his holiness, to seek his benediction, to celebrate his birthday, or to commemorate any event associated with his life would be tantamount to a departure from those established truths that are enshrined within our beloved Faith. 

 The fact that the Guardian has been specifically endowed with such power as he may need to reveal the purport and disclose the implications of the utterances of Baha'u'llah and of tAbdu'1 BaM does not necessarily confer upon him a station coequal with those Whose words he is called upon to interpret. He can exercise that right and discharge this obligation  and yet remain infinitely inferior to both of them in rank and different in nature. 

 To the integrity of this cardinal principle  of our Faith the words, the deeds of its present and future Guardians must abundantly  testify. 

 By their conduct and example they must needs establish its truth upon an unassailable foundation and transmit to future generations unimpeachable evidences of its reality. 

 For my own part to hesitate in recognizing  so vital a truth or to vacillate in proclaiming so firm a conviction must con. stitute a shameless betrayal of the confidence  reposed in me by !Abdu'l-Baha and an unpardonable usurpation of the author-fry fry with which lie Himself has been invested. 

  A word should now be said regarding the theory on which this Administrative Order is based and the principle that must govern the operation of its chief institutions. It would be utterly misleading to attempt a comparison between this unique, this divinely-conceived Order and any of the diverse systems which the minds of men, at various periods of their history, have contrived  for the government of human institutions. 

 Such an attempt would in itself betray a lack of complete appreciation of the excellence of the handiwork of its great Author. How could it be otherwise when we remember that this Order constitutes the very pattern of that divine civilization which the almighty Law of Baha'u'llah is designed to establish upon earth? The divers and ever-shifting systems of human polity, whether past or presens whether originating in the East or in the West, offer no adequate criterion wherewith to estimate the potency of its hidden virtues or to appraise the solidity of its foundations. 

  The Baha'i Commonwealth    

 of the future, of which this vast Administrative Order is the sole framework, is, both in theory and practice, not only unique in the entire history  of political institutions, but can find no parallel in the annals of any of the world's recognized religious systems. No form of democratic government; no system of autocracy or of dictatorship, whether monarchical or republican; no intermediary scheme of a purely aristocratic order; nor even any of the recognized types of theocracy, whether it be the Hebrew Commonwealth, or the various Christian ecclesiastical  organizations, or the Tm~mate or the Caliphate in Isl4m — none of these can be identified or be said to conform with the Administrative Order which the master-hand of its perfect Architect has fashioned. 

 This newborn Administrative

 Order incorporates  within its structure certain elements which are to be found in eadh of the three recognized forms of secular government, without being in any sense a mere replica of any one of them, and without


<p239>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 239

  introducing within its machinery any of the objectionable features which they inherently possess. 

 It blends and harmonizes, as no government fashioned by mortal hands has as yet accomplished, the salutary truths which each of these systems undoubtedly contains without vitiating the integrity of those God-given verities on which it is ultimately founded. 

     The Administrative Order   

 of the Faith of Baha'u'llah must in no wise be regarded as purely democratic in character inasmuch as the basic assumption which requires all democracies to depend fundamentally upon getting their mandate from the people is altogether lacking in this Dispensation. 

 In the conduct of the administrative affairs of the Faith, in the enactment of the legisla-don  necessary to supplement the laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the members of the Universal House of Justice, it should be borne in mind, are not, as Baha'u'llah's utterances clearly imply, responsible to those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly elect them. They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the dictates and promptings of their conscience. 

 They may, indeed they must, acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for themselves the right of an unfettered decision.  !CGod will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth," is Baha'u'llah's incontrovertible assurance. They, and not the body of those who either directly or indirectly elect them, have thus been made the recipients of the divine guidance which is at once the lifeblood and ultimate safeguard of this Revelation. Moreover, he who symbolizes the hereditary principle in this Dispensation has been made the interpreter of the words of its Author, and ceases consequently, by virtue of the actual authority vested in him, to be the figurehead  invariably associated with the prevailing systems of constitutional monarchies. 

 Nor can the Baha'i Administrative Order be dismissed as a hard and rigid system of unmitigated autocracy or as an idle imitation of any form of absolutistic ecclesiastical  government, whether it be the Papacy, the ImAmate or any other similar institution, for the obvious reason that upon the international elected representatives of the followers of Baha'u'llah has been conferred the exclusive right of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the Baha'i writings.  Neither the Guardian of the Faith nor any institution apart from the International House of Justice can ever usurp this vital and essential power or encroach upon that sacred right. The abolition of professional priesthood with its accompanying sacraments of baptism, of communion and of confession of sins, the laws requiring the election by universal suffrage of all local, national, and international Houses of Justice, the total absence of episcopal authority with its attendant privileges, corruptions and bureaucratic tendencies, are further evidences of the non-autocratic character of the Baha'i Administrative Order and of its inclination to democratic methods in the administration of its affairs. 

 Nor is this Order identified with the name of Baha'u'llah to be confused with any system of purely aristocratic government  in view of the fact that it upholds, on the one hand, the hereditary principle and entrusts the Guardian of the Faith with the obligation of interpreting its teachings, and provides, on the other, for the free and direct election from among the mass of the faithful of the body that constitutes its highest legislative organ. 

 'Whereas this Administrative Order cannot  be said to have been modelled after any of these recognized systems of government, it nevertheless embodies, reconciles and assimilates within its framework such wholesome elements as are to be found in each one of them. The hereditary authority which the Guardian is called upon to exer-cisc, the vital and essential functions which the Universal House of Justice discharges, the specific provisions requiring its democratic  election by the representatives of the faithful — these combine to demonstrate the truth that this divinely revealed Order, which can never be identified with any of the standard types of government referred

  to by Aristotle in his works, embodies and blends with the spiritual verities on which it is based the beneficent elements which are to be found in each one of them. 'The admitted evils inherent in each of these systems being rigidly and permanently excluded,  this unique Order, however long it may endure and however extensive its ramifications, cannot ever degenerate into any form of despotism, of oligarchy, or of demagogy which must sooner or later corrupt  the machinery of all manmade and essentially defective political institutions. 

  Dearly-beloved friends! 

 Significant as are the origins of this mighty administrative  structure, and however unique its features, the happenings that may be said to have heralded its birth and signalized the initial stage of its evolution seem no less remarkable. How striking, how edifying  the contrast between the process of siow and steady consolidation that characterizes  the growth of its infant strength and the devastating onrush of the forces of disintegration that are assailing the outworn institutions, both religious and secular, of presentday society! 

 The vitality which the organic institutions of this great, this ever-expanding Order so strongly exhibit; the obstacles which the high courage, the undaunted resolution of its administrators have already surmounted; the fire of an unquenchable enthusiasm that glows with undiminished fervor in the hearts of its itinerant teachers; the heights of self-sacrifice which its' champion-builders are now attaining; the breadth of vision, the confident hope, the creative joy, the inward peace, the uncompromising  integrity, the exemplary discipline, the unyielding unity and solidarity which its stalwart defenders manifest; the degree to which its moving Spirit has shown itself capable of assimilating the diversified elements within its pale, of cleansing them of all forms of prejudice and of fusing them with its own structure — these are evidences of a power which a disillusioned and sadly shaken society can ill afford to ignore. 

 Compare these splendid manifestations of the spirit animating this vibrant body of the Faith of Baha'u'llah with the cries and agony, the follies and vanities, the bitterness  and prejudices, the wickedness and divisions of an ailing and chaotic world. 'Witness the fear that torments its leaders and paralyzes the action of its blind and bewildered statesmen. How fierce the hatreds, how false the ambitions, how petty the pursuits, how deep-rooted the suspicions of its peoples! How disquieting the lawlessness,  the corruption, the unbelief that are eating into the vitals of a tottering civilization! 

 Might not this process of steady deterioration which is insidiously invading so many departments of human activity and thought be regarded as a necessary accompaniment to the rise of this almighty 

Arm of Baha'u'llah  Might

 we not look upon the momentous happenings which, in the course of the past twenty years, have so deeply agitated every continent of the earth, as ominous signs simultaneously proclaiming the agonies of a disintegrating civilization and the birthpangs of that World Order —  that Ark of human salvation — that must needs arise upon its ruins? 

 The catastrophic fall of mighty monarchies and empires in the European continent,  allusions to some of which may be found in the prophecies of Baha'u'llah; the decline that has set in, and its still continuing, in the fortunes of the ShiCih hierarchy in His own native land; the fall of the Qij~r dynasty, the traditional enemy of His Faith; the overthrow of the Sult~nate and the Caliphate, the sustaining pillars of Sunni IslAm, to which the destruction of Jerusalem in the latter part of the first century of the Christian era offers a striking parallel; the wave of secularization which is invading the Mubammadan ecclesiastical institutions in Egypt and sapping the loyalty of its staunchest supporters; the humiliating blows that have afflicted some of the most powerful 

Churches of Christendom

Europe and Central America;

 the dissemination of those subversive doctrines that are undermining the foundations and overthrowing the structure of seemingly impregnable strongholds in the political and social spheres of human activity; the signs of an impending

  catastrophe, strangely reminiscent of the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West, which threatens to engulf the whole structure of presentday civilization — all witness to the tumult which the birth of this mighty Organ of the Religion of Baha'u'llah  has cast into the world — a tumult which will grow in scope and in intensity as the implications of this constantly evolving Scheme are more fully understood and its ramifications more widely extended over the surface of the globe. 
     A word more in conclusion. 

 The rise and establishment of this Administrative Order — the shell that shields and enshrines so precious a gem — constitutes the hallmark of this second and formative age of the Baha'i era. 

 It will come to be regarded, as it recedes farther and farther from our eyes, as the chief agency empowered to usher in the concluding phase, the consummation of this glorious Dispensation. 

 Let no one, while this System is still in its infancy, misconceive its character, belittle  its significance or misrepresent its purpose. The bedrock on which this Administrative Order is founded is God's immutable Purpose for mankind in this day. The Source from which it derives its inspiration is no one less than Baha'u'llah Himself. 

 Its shield and defender are the embattled hosts of the AtM Kingdom. Its seed is the blood of no less than twenty thousand martyrs who have offered up their lives that it may be born and flourish. The axis round which its institutions revolve are the authentic provisions of the Will and Testament of ~Abd'1Bh' Its guiding principles are the truths which He Who is the unerring Interpreter of the teachings of our Faith has so clearly enunciated in His public addresses throughout the West. The laws that govern its operation and limit its functions are those which have been expressly ordained in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.  The seat round which its spiritual, its humanitarian and administrative activities  will cluster are the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and its Dependencies. The pillars that sustain  its authority and buttress its structure are the twin institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice. The central, the underlying aim which animates it is the establishment of the New World Order as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah. 

 The methods it employs, the standard  it inculcates, incline it to neither East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor poor, neither white nor colored. Its watchword is the unification of the human race; its standard the "Most Great Peace"; its consummation the advent of that golden millennium — the Day when the kingdoms of this world shall have become the Kingdom of God Himself, the Kingdom of 

Baha'u'llah. (February      
8, 1934.)                  
                           
        THE UNFOLDMENT OF WORLD CIVILIZATION

  As your co-sharer in the building up of the New World Order which the mind of Baha'u'llah has visioned, and whose features the pen of cAbdu~1~BahA its perfect Architect,  has delineated, I pause to contemplate with you the scene which the revolution of well-nigh fifteen years after His passing unfolds before us. The contrast between the accumulating evidences of steady consolidation that accompany  the rise of the Administrative Order of the Faith of God, and the forces of disintegration which batter at the fabric of a travailing society, is as clear as it is arresting. 

 Both within and outside the Baha'i world the signs and tokens which, in a mysterious manner, are heralding the birth of that World Order, the establishment  of which must signalize the Golden Age of the Cause of God, are growing and multiplying day by day. No fair-minded observer can any longer fail to discern them. He cannot be misled by the painful slowness characterizing the unfoldment of the civilization which the followers of Baha'u'llah are laboring to establish. 

 Nor can he be deluded by the ephemeral manifestations of returning prosperity which at times appear to be capable of checking the disruptive influence of the chronic ills afflicting the institutions of a decaying age. The signs of the times are too numerous

  and compelling to allow him to mistake their character or to belittle their significance.  He can, if he be fair in his judgment,  recognize in the chain of events which proclaim on the one hand the irresistible  march of the institutions directly associated with the Revelation of Baha'u'llah  and foreshadow on the other the downfall of those powers and principalities that have either ignored or opposed it —  he can recognize in them all evidences of the operation of God's all-pervasive Will, the shaping of His perfectly ordered and world-embracing 

Plan.                      

 r~Soon,~~ Baha'u'llah's own words proclaim  it, ~will the present day Order b~ rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead. Verily, thy Lord spealzetl3 the truth and is the Knower of things unseen." ~By Myself," He solemnly asserts, ~the day is approaching when We wili have rolled up the world and all that is therein, and spread out a new Order in its stead. 

 He, verily, is powerful over all things." ~The world's equilibrium," He explains, ~hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this Most Great, this new World Order. Mankind's  ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System, the like of which mortal eyes have never wh~nessed." 

 ~The signs of impending convulsions and chaos," He warns the peoples of the world, ~can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing Order appeareth to be lamentably de-f ective." 
  Dearly-beloved friends!    

 This New World Order, whose promise is enshrined in the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, whose fundamental  principles have been enunciated in the writings of the Center of His Covenant, involves no iess than the complete unification  of the entire human race. This unification should conform to such principles as would directly harmonize with the spirit that animates, and the laws that govern the operation of, the institutions that already constitute the structural basis of the Administrative 

Order of His Faith.        

 No machinery falling short of the standard  inculcated by the Baha'i Revelation, and at variance with the sublime pattern ordained in His teachings, which the col lective efforts of mankind may yet devise can ever hope to achieve anything above or beyond that ~Lesser Peace" to which the Author of our Faith has Himself alluded in His writings. 

 ~Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace," He, admonishing the kings and rulers of the earth, has written, ~ho1d ye fast i~nto this the Lesser Peace, that 13a ply ye may in some degree better your own condition and that of your dependents." Expatiating on this Lesser Peace, He thus addresses in that same Tablet  the rulers of the earth: "Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no more armaments save in a measure to safeguard  your territories and doininions Be united, 0 kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stifled amongst you, and your peoples find rest, if ye be of them that comprehend. Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice." 

 The Most Great Peace, on the other hand, as conceived by Baha'u'llah — a peace that must inevitably follow as the practical consequence  of the spiritualization of the world and the fusion of all its races, creeds, classes and nations — can rest on no other basis, and can be preserved through no other agency, except the divinely appointed ordinances that are implicit in the W~or1d Order that stands associated with His holy name. In His Tablet, revealed almost seventy years ago to Queen Victoria, Baha'u'llah, alluding to this Most Great Peace, has declared: ~That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician. 

 This, verily, is the truth, and all else naught but error Consider these days in which the Ancient Beauty, He Who is the Most Great Name, hath been sent down to regenerate and unify mankind. Behold how with drawn swords they rose against Him, and committed that which caused the Faithful Spirit to tremble. And whenever We said unto them: !Lo, the World Reformer is come,' they made reply:


<p243>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 243

 rHC, in truth, is one of the stirrers of mischief.' 

 ,, !!fl beseerneth all men in this Day," He, in another Tablet, asserts, to take firm hold on the Most Great Name, and to establish the unity of all mankind. There is no place to flee to, no refuge that any one can seek, except Him." 
                           
 Humanity's Coming of Age   

  The Revelation of Baha'u'llah, whose supreme mission is none other but the achievement of this organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to its implications, be regarded as signalizing through its advent the coming of age of the entire human race. It should be viewed not merely as yet another spiritual revival in the ever-chang-ing  fortunes of mankind, not only as a further stage in a chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man s collective life on this planet. The emergence of a world community, the consciousness  of world citizenship, the founding  of a world civilization and culture — all of which must synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the Golden Age of the Baha'i Era — should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the furthermost  limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an individual, will, nay must indeed as a result of such a con —  summation, continue indefinitely to progress and develop. 

 That mystic, all-pervasive, yet indefinable  change, which we associate with the stage of maturity inevitable in the life of the individual and the development of the fruit must, if we would correctly apprehend  the utterances of Baha'u'llah, have its counterpart in the evolution of the organization  of human society. A similar stage must sooner or later be attained in the collective life of mankind, producing an even more striking phenomenon in world relations, and endowing the whole human race with such potentialities of well — being as shall provide, throughout the succeeding ages, the chief incentive required for the eventual fulfilment of its high destiny. Such a stage of maturity in the process of human government must, for all time, if we would faithfully recognize the tremendous  claim advanced by Baha'u'llah, remain identified with the Revelation of which He was the Bearer. 

 In one of the most characteristic passages He Himself has revealed, He testifies in a language that none can mistake to the truth of this distinguishing principle of Baha'i belief: "It hath been decreed by Us that Ihe Word of God and a11 the potentialities thereof shall be manifested unto inert in strict conformity with such con di —  tions as have been foreordained by Hi-rn Who is the' All-Knowing, the All-Wise Should the Word be allowed to release suddenly all the energies latent within it, no man could sustain the weight of so mighty a revelation Consider that which hath been sent down unto Muloans-mad, the Apostle of God. The measure of the Revelation of which He was the Bearer had been clearly foreordained by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. They that heard Hi-rn, however, could apprehend His purpose only to the extent of their station and spiritual capacity. He, in like manner, uncovered the Face of W/is-dons  in ~ro portion to their ability to sustain the burden of His Message. No sooner had mankind attained the stage of maturity, than the SWord revealed to men's eyes the latent energies with which it had been endowed  — energies which manifested themselves in the plenitude of their glory when the Ancient Beauty appeared, in the year sixty, in the person of !Ali~Mu1oanz~mad, tide 

Bab."                      

 CAbdu~1~Bahi elucidating this fundamental  verity, has written: All created things have their degree or stage of mat ur-ity.  The period of maturity in the life of a tree is the time of its fruit-bearing The aninial attains a stage of full growth and completeness, and in the human kingdom  man reaches his maturity when the light of his intelligence attains its greatest power and development Similarly there are periods and stages in the collective life of humanity. At one time it was passing  through its stage of childhood, at


<p244>
244             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  another its period of youth, but now it has entered its long-predicted phase of inatur-ity,  the evidences of which are everywhere apparent That which was applicable to human needs during the early history of the race can neither meet nor satisfy the demands of this day, this period of newness  and consummation. 

 Humanity has emerged from its former state of lhnitation and preihuinary training. 

 Man must now become imbued with new virtues and powers, new moral standards, new capacities.  New bounties, perfect bestowals, arc awaiting and already descending upon him. The gifts and blessings of the period of youth, although thnely and sufficient dur —  big the adolescence of inanizind, are now incapable of meeting the requirements o-its maturity." 
                          
The Process of Integration

  Such a unique and momentous crisis in the life of organized mankind may, moreover,  be likened to the culminating stage in the political evolution of the great American Republic — the stage which marked the emergence of a unified community of federated states. The stirring of a new national consciousness, and the birth of a new type of civilization, infinitely richer and nobler than any which its component parts could have severally hoped to achieve, may be said to have proclaimed the coining of age of the American people. Within the territorial limits of this nation, this consummation may be viewed as the culmination  of the process of human government. 

 The diversified and loosely related elements of a divided community were brought together, unified and incorporated into one coherent system. Though this entity may continue gaining in cohesive power, though the unity already achieved may be further consolidated, though the civilization to which that unity could alone have given birth may expand and flourish, yet the machinery essential to such an unfoldment  may be said to have been, in its essential structure, erected, and the impulse required to guide and sustain it may be regarded as having been fundamentally imparted.  No stage above and beyond this consummation of national unity can, within the geographical limits of that nation, be imagined, though the highest destiny of its people, as a constituent element in a still larger entity that will embrace the whole of mankind, may still remain unfulfilled. Considered as an isolated unit, however, this process of integration may be said to have reached its highest and final consummation. 

 Such is the stage to which an evolving humanity is collectively approaching. 

 The Revelation entrusted by the Almighty Ordainer to Baha'u'llah, His followers firmly believe, has been endowed with such potentialities as are commensurate with the maturity of the human race — the crowning and most momentous stage in its evolution from infancy to manhood. 

    The successive Founders   

 of all past Religions Who, from time immemorial, have shed, with ever-increasing intensity, the splendor of one common Revelation at the various stages which have marked the advance of mankind towards maturity may thus, in a sense, be regarded as preliminary Manifestations, anticipating and paving the way for the advent of that Day of Days when the whole earth will have fructified and the tree of humanity will have yielded its destined fruit. 

 Incontrovertible as is this truth, its challenging character should never be allowed to obscure the purpose, or distort the principle,  underlying the utterances of Baha'u'llah  — utterances that have established for all time the absolute oneness of all the Prophets, Himself included, whether belonging  to the past or to the future. Though the mission of the Prophets preceding  Baha'u'llah may be viewed in that light, though the measure of Divine Revelation  with which each has been entrusted must, as a result of this process of evolution,  necessarily differ, their common origin, their essential unity, their identity of purpose,  should at no time and under no circumstances  be misapprehended or denied. That all the Messengers of God should be regarded as frabiding in the same Tabernacle, soaring in the same Heaven, seated upon the same Throne, uttering the same Speech, and proclaiming the same Faith" must, however much we may extol the


<p245>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 245

  measure of Divine Revelation vouchsafed to mankind at this crowning stage of its evolution, remain the unalterable foundation and central tenet of Baha'i belief. Any variations in the splendor which each of these Manifestations of the Light of God has shed upon the world should be ascribed not to any inherent superiority involved in the essential character of any one of them, but rather to the progressive capacity, the ever-increasing spiritual receptiveness, which mankind, in its progress towards maturity, has invariably manifested. 
                           
  The Final Consummation     

  Only those who are willing to associate the Revelation proclaimed by Baha'u'llah with the consummation of so stupendous an evolution in the collective life of the whole human race can grasp the significance of the words which He, while alluding  to the glories of this promised Day and to the duration of the Baha'i Era, has deemed fit to utter. This is the King of Days," He exclaims, !rthe Day that bath seen the coming of the Best-Beloved, Him Who, through all eternity, hat/a been at--claimed the Desire of the World." 

 !CT/JC Scriptures of past Dispensations," He further asserts, ercelebrate the great jubilee that must needs greet this most great Day of God. Well is U with I&km that hat/i lived to see this Day and hath recognized its station."  "It is evident," He, in another passage explains, erthat every age in which a Manifestation of God loath lived is divinely-ordained, and may, in a sense, be characterized as God's appointed Day. This Day, however, is unique, and is to be distinguished from those that have preceded it.     The designation eseal of the Prophets' fully revealeth its high station. 

 The Prophetic  Cycle hath verily ended. The Eternal Truth is now come. He hath lifted up the ensign of rower, and is now shedding upon the world the unclouded splendor of His Revelation." 

 ~~In this most mighty Revelation;'  He, in categorical language, declares,  trail the Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their final consummation.  That which hath been made manifest in this pre-ensinent, this most exalted Revelation, standeth unparalleled in the annals of the past, nor will future ages 'witness its like." 

 Abdu'l-Baha's authentic pronouncements should, likewise, be recalled as confirming, in no less emphatic manner, the unexampled vastness of the Baha'i Dispensation. 

 "Cen-tunes,"  He affirms in one of His Tablets, "nay, countless ages, in<ust pass away tie the DayStar of Truth shineth again in its mid — summer splendor, or appeareth once more in the radiance of its vernal glory The mere contemplation of the Dispensation  inaugurated by the Blessed Beauty would have sufficed to overwhelm the saints of bygone ages — saints who longed to partake, for one moment, of its great glory." ~~Concerning the Manifestations  that will come down in the future em the shadows of the clouds,' " He, in a still more definite language, affirms, rrkisow verily, that in so far as their relation to the Source of their inspiration is concerned, they are under the shadow of the Ancient Beauty. In their relation, however, to the age in which they appear, each and every one of them edoetio whatsoever He willeth.' r!7~NS holy Dispensation," He, alluding to the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, explains, !!is tilumined with the light of the Sun of Truth shining from its most exalted station, and in the plenitude of its resplendency,  its heat and glory." 

  Pangs of Death and Birth Dearly-beloved friends: 

Though the Revelation      

 of Baha'u'llah has been delivered, the World Order which such a Revelation must needs beget is as yet unborn. Though the Heroic Age of 1-us Faith is passed, the creative energies which that Age has released have not as yet crystallized into that world society which, in the fulness of time, is to mirror forth the brightness of His glory. Though the framework of His Administrative Order has been erected, and the Formative Period of the Baha'i Era has begun, yet the promised Kingdom into which the seed of His institutions must ripen remains 'as yet uninaugurated. Though His Voice has been raised, and the ensigns of His Faith have been lifted up in no less than forty countries of both the East and the 'West, yet the wholeness of


<p246>
246             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the human race is as yet unrecognized, its unity unproclaimed, and the standard of its Most Great Peace unhoisted. 

 reThe heights," Baha'u'llah Himself testifies,  rewbich, through the most gracious favor of God, mortal man can attain in this Day are as yet unrevealed to his sight. The world of being hatlo never had, nor dotlo it yet possess, the capacity for such a revela-flon.  The day, however, is approaching when the poteistialities of so great a favor will, by virtue of His behest, be manifested unto men." 

 For the revelation of so great a favor a period of intense turmoil and widespread suffering would seem to be indispensable. Resplendent as has been the Age that has witnessed the inception of the Mission with which Baha'u'llah has been entrusted, the interval which must elapse cit that Age yields its choicest fruit must, it is becoming increasingly apparent, be overshadowed by such moral and social gloom as can alone prepare an unrepentant humanity for the prize she is destined to inherit. 

 Into such a period we are now steadily and irresistibly moving. Amidst the shadows which are increasingly gathering about us we can faintly discern the glimmerings of Baha'u'llah's unearthly sovereignty appealing  fitfully on the horizon of history. To us, the cegeneration of the half-light," living at a time which may be designated as the period of the incubation of the World Commonwealth envisaged by Baha'u'llah, has been assigned a task whose high privilege we can never sufficiently appreciate,  and the arduousness of which we can as yet but dimly recognize. 

 We may well believe, we who are called upon to experience  the operation of the dark forces destined to unioose a flood of agonizing afflictions, that the darkest hour that must precede the dawn of the Golden Age of our Faith has not yet struck. Deep as is the gloom that already encircles the world, the afflictive ordeals which that world is to suffer are still in preparation, nor can their blackness be as yet imagined. We stand on the threshold of an age whose convui-sions  proclaim alike the death-pangs of the old order and the birth-pangs of the new. Through the generating influence of the Faith announced by Baha'u'llah this New World Order may be said to have been conceived. 

 We can, at the present moment,  experience its stirrings in the womb of a travailing age — an age waiting for the appointed hour at which it can cast its burden and yield its fairest fruit. 

 erThe whole earth," writes Baha'u'llah, rem now in a state of pregnancy. The day is approaching when it will have yielded its noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth the loftiest trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly blessings. 

 Immeasurably exalted is the breeze that wafteth from the garment of thy 

Lord, the Glorified!       

 For lo, it loath breathed its fragrance and made all things new! Well is it with thens that cons fire-hen  dr ~~The onrushing winds of the grace of God," He, in the Si5ratu'1-Haykal, proclaims,  rrhave passed over all things. Every creature ha/h been endowed with all the potentialities it can carry. And yet the peoples of the world have denied this grace! Every tree haTh been endowed with the choicest fruits, every ocean enriched with the most luminous gems. Man, himself, hat/i been invested with the gifts of nnder —  standing and knowledge. The whole creation  hat/i been made the recipient of the revelation of the All-Merciful, and the earth the repository of things inscrutable to all except God, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. 

 The time is approaching when every created thing will have cast its burden. 

Glorified be God Who       

 hath vouchsafed this grace that encompasseth all things, whether seen or unseen!" 

 erThe Call of God," tAbdu'1-Bahi has written, rrwhen raised, breathed a new life into the body of mankind, and infused a new spirit into the whole creation. 

 It is for this reason that the world hat/a been moved to its depths, and the hearts and consciences of men been quickened. 

 Erelong the evidences of this regeneration will be revealed, and the fast asleep will be awakened." 
                           
 Universal Fermentation    

  As we view the world around us, we are compelled to observe the manifold evidences of that universal fermentation which, in


<p247>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 247

  every continent of the globe and in every department of human life, be it religious, social, economic or political, is purging and reshaping humanity in anticipation of the Day when the wholeness of the human race will have been recognized and its unity established. A twofold process, however, can be distinguished, each tending, in its own way and with an accelerated momentum,  to bring to a climax the forces that are transforming the face of our planet. The first is essentially an integrating process, while the second is fundamentally disruptive. 

 The former, as it steadily evolves, unfolds a System which may we11 serve as a pattern for that world polity towards which a strangely disordered world is continually advancing; while the latter, as its disintegrating influence deepens, tends to tear down, with increasing violence, the antiquated barriers that seek to block humanity's progress towards its destined goal. 

 The constructive process stands associated with the nascent Faith of Baha'u'llah,  and is the harbinger of the New 'World Order that Faith must erelong estab —  lish. The destructive forces that characterize  the other should be identified with a civilization that has refused to answer to the expectation of a new age, and is consequently falling into chaos and decline. 

 A titanic, a spiritual struggle, unparalleled in its magnitude yet unspeakably glorious in its ultimate consequences, is being waged as a result of these opposing tendencies, in this age of transition through which the organized community of the followers of Baha'u'llah and mankind as a whole are passing. 

 The Spirit that has incarnated itself in the institutions of a rising Faith has, in the course of its onward march for the redemption of the world, encountered and is now battling with such forces as are, in most instances, the very negation of that Spirit, and whose continued existence must inevitably  hinder it from achieving its purpose. The hollow and outworn institutions, the obsolescent doctrines and beliefs, the effete and discredited traditions which these forces represent, it should be observed, have, in certain instances, been undermined by virtue of their senility, the ioss of their co hesive power, and their own inherent corruption. 

 A few have been swept away by the onrushing forces which the Baha'i Faith has, at the hour of its birth, so mysteriously released. Others, as a direct re-suit  of a vain and feeble resistance to its rise in the initial stages of its development, have died out and been utterly discredited. Still others, fearful of the pervasive influence  of the institutions in which that same Spirit had, at a later stage, been embodied, had mobilized their forces and launched their attack, destined to sustain, in their turn, after a brief and illusory success, an ignominious defeat. 
                          
  This Age of Transition    

  It is not my purpose to call to mind, much less to attempt a detailed analysis of, the spiritual struggles that have ensued, or to note the victories that have redounded to the glory of the Faith of Baha'u'llah since the day of its foundation. 

 My chief concern is not with the happenings that hav~ distinguished the First, the Apostolic Age of the Baha'i Dispensation, but rather with the outstanding events that are transpiring in, and the tendencies which characterize,  the formative period of its development,  this Age of Transition, whose tribulations are the precursors of that Era of blissful felicity which is to incarnate God's ultimate purpose for all mankind. 

 To the catastrophic fall of mighty kingdoms  and empires, on the eve of CAbdu~1 Baha'is departure, Whose passing may be said to have ushered in the opening phase of the Age of Transition in which we now live, I have, in a previous communication, briefly alluded. The dissolution of the German  Empire, the humiliating defeat inflicted upon its ruler, the successor and lineal descendant  of the Prussian King and Emperor  to whom Baha'u'llah had addressed His solemn and historic warning, together with the extinction of the Austro-Hun-garian Monarchy, the remnant of the once-great  Holy Roman Empire, were both precipitated  by a war whose outbreak signalized the opening of the Age of Frustration destined to precede the establishment of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. Both of these momentous events may be viewed as the


<p248>
248             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  earliest occurrences of that turbulent Age, into the outer fringes of whose darkest phase we are now beginning to enter. 

 To the Conqueror of Napoleon III, the Author of our Faith had, on the morrow of the King's victory, addressed, in His Most Holy Book, this clear and ominous warning:  ~O King of Berlin! Take heed lest pride debar thee from recognizing the Days pring of Divine Revelation, lest earthly desires shut thee out, as by a veil, from the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth below. 

 Thus counselleth thee the Pen of the Most High. 

 He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Do thou remember  the one whose power transcended thy power (Napoleon III), and whose station  excelled thy station. Where is he? Whither are gone the things he possessed? Take warning, and be not of them that are fast asleep. 

 He it was who cast the Tablet of God behind hi-rn, when We made known unto him what the hosts of tyranny had caused Us to suffer. Wherefore, dis —  grace assailed him from all sides, and he went down to dust in great loss. Think deeply, 0 King, concerning him, and concerning  them who, like unto thee, have conquered  cities and ruled over men. The All-Merciful brought them down from their palaces to their graves. Be warned, be of them who reflect." 
    ~O banks of the Rhine!"    

 Baha'u'llah, in another passage of that same Book, prophe-sles,  ~We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and so you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations  of Berlin, though she be today ~n conspicuous  glory." 
                           
    Divine Retribution         

  The whole of mankind is groaning, is dying to be led to unity, and to terminate its agelong martyrdom. And yet it stubbornly  refuses to embrace the light and acknowledge the sovereign authority of the one Power that can extricate it from its entanglements, and avert the woeful calamity that threatens to engulf it. Ominous indeed is the voice of Baha'u'llah  that rings through these prophetic words: ~O ye peoples of the world! Know, verily, that an unforeseen calamity followeth  you, and grievous retribution await eth you. Think not that which ye have committed hath been effaced in My sight." And again: ~We have a fixed time for you, 0 peoples. If ye jail, at the appointed hour, to turn towards God, He, verily, will lay violent hold on you, and 'will cause grievous afflictions to assail you from every direction.  How severe, indeed, is the chastise~ inent with which your Lord will then chastise  you!" 

 Must humanity, tormented as she now is, be afflicted with still severer tribulations ere their purifying influence can prepare her to enter the heavenly Kingdom destined to be established upon earth? Must the inauguration  of so vast, SO unique, so illumined an era in human history be ushered in by so great a catastrophe in human affairs as to recall, nay surpass, the appalling collapse of Roman civilization in the first centuries of the Christian Era? 

 Must a series of profound convulsions stir and rock the human race ere Baha'u'llah can be enthroned in the hearts and consciences of the masses, ere His undisputed ascendancy is universally recognized, and the noble edifice of His World Order is reared and established? 

 The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which the human race had to pass, have receded into the background. 

 Humanity  is now experiencing the commotions invariably associated with the most turbulent  stage of its evolution, the stage of adolescence,  when the impetuosity of youth and its vehemence reach their climax, and must gradually be superseded by the calni-ness,  the wisdom, and the maturity that characterize the stage of manhood. 

 Then will the human race reach that stature Of ripeness which will enable it to acquire all the powers and capacities upon which its ultimate development must depend. 
                           
   World Unity the Goal       

  Unification of the whole of mankind is the hallmark of the stage which human society is now approaching. Unity of f am-ily,  of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been successively attempted and fully established. 

 World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity is striving.

  don-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. 

 A world, growing  to maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human  relationships, and establish once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its life. 

 new life," Baha'u'llah proclaims, ~is, in this age, stirring within all the peoples of the earth; and yet none hath discovered its cause, or perceived its motive." 

 ~O ye children of men," He thus addresses His generation, ~the fundamental purpose animating  the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race. This is the straight path, the fixed and immovable foundation. 

 Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure." ~Thc wellbeing of inanizind," He declares, ~its peace and security are unaltainable unless and until its u~iity is firmly established." 

 ~So powerful  is the light of nnh~y," is His further testimony, ~~that it can illuminate the whole earth. The one true God, He Who knoweth all things, Himself testifieth to the truth of these words This goal excel-leth every other goal, and this aspiration is the monarch of all aspirations." 

 ~He Who is your Lord, the All — Merciful," He moreover,  has written, ~rcherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the entire human race as one soul and one body. Haste ye to win your share of God's good grace and mercy in this Day that eclipseth all other created days." 

 The unity of the human race, as envisaged  by Baha'u'llah, implies the estab —  lishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely  and completely safeguarded. 

 This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, Consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. 

 A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard  the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. 

 A world tribunal will adjudicate  and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements consti —  tuting this universal system. A mechanism  of world intercommunication will be devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity. A world metropo-us  will act as the nerve center of a world civilization, the focus towards which the unifying forces of life will converge and from which its energizing influences will radiate. 

 A world language will either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary to their mother tongue. 

 A world script, a world literature, a uniform and universal system of currency, of weights and measures,  will simplify and facilitate intercourse and understanding among the nations and races of mankind. 

 In such a world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces in human life, will be reconciled, will cooperate, and will harmoniously develop. The press will, under such a system, while giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and conVictions of man —  kind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private or public,  and will be liberated from the influence of contending governments and peoples. The economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets  will be coordinated and developed, and the distribution of its products will be equitably regulated. 

 National rivalries, hatreds, and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity, understanding  and cooperation. 
The causes of religious


<p250>
250              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  strife will be permanently removed, economic  barriers and restrictions will be completely  abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear. The enormous energy dissipated  and wasted on war, whether economic  or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the range of human inventions and technical development, to the increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising  of the standard of physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human  brain, to the exploitation of the unused  and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race. 

 A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising unchallengeable author-fry  over its unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the 'West, liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources •of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation —  such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving. 

 One of the great events," affirms tAb-du'1-BaM,  "which is to occur in the Day of the manifestation of that incomparable Branch is the hoisting of the Standard of God among all nations. 

 By this is meant that all nations and kindreds will be gathered  together under the shadow of this Divine Banner, which is no other than the Lordly Branch itself, and will become a single nation. Religkus and sectarian an-tagonisin, the hostility of races and peoples, and differences among nations, will be eliminated. 

 All men will adhere to one religion, will have one common faith, will be blended into one race and become a single people. All will dwell in one common fatherland, which is the planet itself." ~Now, in the world of being," He has moreover explained, !ethe Hand of Divine power hath firmly laid the foundations of this all-highest bounty, and this wondrous gift. 

 W/hatsoever is latent in the innermost of this holy Cycle shall gradually af pear and be made manifest, for now is hut the beginning of its growth, and the dayspring of the revelation of its signs. Ere the close of this century and of this age, it shall be made clear and evident how wondrous was that springtide, and how heavenly was that gift." 

 No less enthralling is the vision of Isaiah, the greatest of the Hebrew Prophets, predicting, as far back as twenty-five hundred years ago, the destiny which mankind must, at its stage of maturity, achieve: reAnd He (the Lord) shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruisii~ghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. And there shall come forth a rod out of the stein of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faith fit/ness the girdle of his reins. 

 The wolf also shall dwell with the lwrnb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together. 

 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." 

 The writer of the Apocalypse, prefiguring  the millennial glory which a redeemed, a jubilant humanity must witness, has similarly testified: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride

  adorned for her husband. 

 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. 

 Who can doubt that such a consummation  — the coming of age of the human race — must signalize, in its turn, the inauguration of a world civilization such as no mortal  eye hath ever beheld or human mind conceived? Who is it that can imagine the lofty standard which such a civilization, as it unfolds itself, is destined to attain? Who can measure the heights to which human intelligence, liberated from its shackles, will soar? 

 Who can visualize the realms which the human spirit, vitalized by the outpouring  light of Baha'u'llah, shining in the plenitude of its glory, will discover? 

 What more fitting conclusion to this theme than these words of Baha'u'llah, written in anticipation of the golden age of His Faith — the age in which the face of the earth, from poic to pole, will mirror the ineffable splendors of the AbliA Paradise? 

 reThis is the Day whereon naught can be seen except the splendors of the Light that shineth from the face of thy Lord, the Gracious, the Most Bountiful. 

 Verily, We have caused every soul to expire by virtue of Our irresistible and all-subduing sovereignty. 

 We have then called into be-big  a new creation, as a token of Our grace unto men. I am, verily, the 

All-Bountiful, the Ancient

 of Days. This is the Day whereon the unseen world crieth out: rGreat is thy blessedness, 0 earth, for thou hast been made the footstool of thy God, and been chosen as the seat of His mighty throne!' 

 The realm of glory excialmeth: eWould that my life could be sacrificed for thee, for He Who is the Beloved of the All-Merciful hat/i established His sovereignty upon thee, through the power of His name that bath been promised unto all things, whether of the past or of the fit-hire.'" (March 11, 1936.)

 (rAnd now as I look into the future, I hope to see the friends at all times, in every land, and of every shade of thought and character, voluntarily and joyously rallying rouna9 their local and in particular their national centers of activity, upholding and promoting their interests with complete unanimity and contentment, with perfect understanding, genuine enthusiasm, and sits tamed vigor. This indeed is the one joy and yearning of my life, for it is the fountainhead from which all future blessings will flow, the broad foundation upon which the security of the Divine Edifice must ultimately rest." —

                      FOREWORD

     The 19261927 National     

 Spiritual Assembly  of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada completed a task which, while pertaining to the outer and more material aspects of the Cause, nevertheless has a special  significance for its spirit and inward sacred purpose. This task consisted in creating  a legal form which gives proper substance and substantial character to the administrative processes embodied in the Baha'i Teachings. 

 The form adopted was that known as a Voluntary Trust, a species of corporation recognized under the common  law and possessing a long and interesting history. The famous Covenant adopted by the Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower,  the first legal document in American  history, is of the same nature as the Declaration of Trust voted by the National Spiritual 

Assembly. This Declaration 

 of Trust, with its attendant ByLaws, is published for the information of the Baha'is

 The National Spiritual Assembly in adopting this form of association, , union and fellowship, and in selecting for itself the designation of Trustees of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, does so as the administrative body of a religious community which has had continuous existence and responsibility for over eighteen years.

  of the world. Careful examination of the Declaration and its ByLaws will reveal the fact that this document contains no arbitrary  elements nor features new to the Baha'i Cause. On the contrary, it represents a most conscientious effort to reflect those very administrative principles and elements already set forth in the letters of the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, and already determining the methods and relationships of Baha'i collective association. The provision both in the Declaration and in the ByLaws  for amendments in the future will permit the National Spiritual Assembly to adapt this document to such new administrative  elements or principles as the Guardian  may at any time give forth. The Dec —  laration, in fact, is nothing more or less than a legal parallel of those moral and spiritual laws of unity inherent in the fulness  of the Baha'i Revelation and making it the fulfillment of the ideal of Religion in the social as well as spiritual realm. Because in the Baha'i Faith this perfect correspondence exists between spiritual and social laws, the Baha'is believe that adminis —  trative success is identical with moral success;  and that nothing iess than the true Baha'i spirit of devotion and sacrifice can inspire with effective power the worldwide body of unity, revealed by Baha'u'llah. Therefore it has seemed fitting and proper to accompany the Declaration of Trust with excerpts from the letters of Shoghi Effendi which furnished the source whence the provisions of the Declaration were drawn, and which furthermore give due emphasis to that essential spirit without which any and every social or religious form is but a dead and soulless body.

    Where the National Spiritual

 Assembly has been given in these ByLaws exclusive and final jurisdiction, and paramount ex~ ecutive authority, in all matters pertaining to the activities and affairs of the RaM' Cause in India and Burma, it is understood that any decision made or action taken upon such matters shall be subject in every instance to ultimate review and approval by the Guardian of the Cause or the Universal 

House of Justice.          
                           
        ARTICLE 10                 

  'Whatever functions and powers are not specifically attributed to local Spiritual Assemblies in these ByLaws shall be considered  vested in the National Spiritual Assembly, which body is authorised to delegate  such discretionary functions and powers as it deems necessary and advisable to the local 

Spiritual Assemblies       
within its Iurisdiction.   
                           
        ARTICLE 11                 

  In order to preserve the spiritual character  and purpose of Baha'i elections, the practice of nominations or any other electoral method detrimental to a silent and prayerful election shall not prevail, so that each elector may vote for none but those whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold. 

 Among the most outstanding and sacred duties incumbent upon those who have been called upon to initiate, direct and coordinate  the affairs of the Cause as members of local or National Spiritual Assemblies are: —  To win by every means in their power the confidence and affection of those whom it is +heir privilege to serve; to investigate and acquaint themselves with the considered views, the prevailing sentiments and the personal convictions of those whose welfare it is their solemn obligation to promote; to purge their deliberations and the general conduct of their affairs of selfcontained aloofness, the suspicion of secrecy, the stifling atmosphere of dictatorial assertiveness and of every word and deed that may savor of partiality, seif-centeredness and prejudice; and while retaining the sacred right of final decision in their hands, to invite discussion, ventilate grievances, welcome  advice, and foster the sense of interdependence and copartnership, of understanding and mutual confidence between  themselves and all other Baha'is. 
                           
        ARTICLE 12                 

  These Bylaws may be amended by majority vote of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 at any of its regular or special meetings, provided that at least fourteen days prior to the date fixed for the said meeting a copy of the proposed amendment or amendments is mailed to each member of the Assembly by the Secretary.

               BYLAWS OF THE SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY
          THE BAHA'IS OF THE CITY
                    OF NEW YORK1

  rr     ARTICLE I I HE Baha'is of the City of New York adopt this Corporation in order to supply proper legal status to the conduct of the affairs of a religious community which has had continuous existence for more than thirty years, being one of the first two local Baha'i communities established in North America. 

 During this period the community has been recognized, encouraged and instructed in letters and communications addressed to it by cAbd~1B1 who in one communication designated New York t~The City of the Covenant." 

 It was in this city that CAbd~1Bh~ devoted the larger portion of His American visit in 1912. The Assembly has been recognized since the Ascension of CAbd~1Bh~ in letters addressed to it by the Guardian of the 

Baha'i Faith. The New     

 York Baha community has been continuously and uninterruptedly  represented by delegates in the Annual Meetings held by the recognized national Baha'i body of North America since the formation of that body in 1909. The Spiritual Assembly is at present enrolled  in the list of Local Spiritual Assemblies recognized by the National 

Spiritual Assembly.       

 The Trustees, i.e., the Spiritual Assembly,  recognize that this action has been taken in full unanimity and agreement. They acknowledge for themselves and on behalf of their successors the sacred meaning  and universal purpose of the Baha'i Faith, the teachings and principles of which fulfil the divine promise of all former revealed  religions. 
                          
        ARTICLE II                

  In administering the affairs of the Baha'i Religion under this Corporation for the benefit of the Baha'is of the City of New York in accordance with the religious teachings and administrative principles of this Faith, the Spiritual Assembly shall act in conformity with the functions of a Local 1 The pattern for all local Baha'i constitutions. 

 Spiritud Assembly as defined in the ByLaws  adopted by the National Spiritual Assembly and published by that body for the information and guidance of Baha'is throughout the United States and 

Canada.                   
                          
       ARTICLE III               

  The Spiritual Assembly, in the fulfillment  of its obligations and responsibilities under this Corporation, shall have exclusive jurisdiction and authority over all the local activities and affairs of the Baha'i community of the City of New York, including paramount authority in the administration of this Corporation.

  community, for the information and approval  of the national 

Baha body. The Spiritual 

 Assembly, however, shall recognize the authority and right of the National Spiritual Assembly to declare at any time what activities and affairs of the Baha'i community of the City of New York are national in scope and hence subject to the jurisdiction of the national Baha'i body. It shall likewise recognize the right of any member of the community to appeal to the National Spiritual Assembly for review and decision of any matter in which the previous  decision of the local Spiritual Assem-lily  is felt by the member to be contrary to the explicit teachings of the Baha'i Faith or opposed to its best interests. 

 It shall, on the other hand, have the authority and right to appeal from the decision of the National Assembly to the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith for review and final decision of any matter related to the Faith in the City of New York. 
                          
        ARTICLE IV                

  The Spiritual Assembly, in administering this Corporation, shall ever bear in mind the ideals upheld in the Sacred Writings of the Baha Faith respecting the relationships of a Spiritual Assembly to its Baha corn —  munity, respecting the relations of Baha'is to one another in the community, and the relationships of Baha'is to all non-BahWis, without prejudice of race, creed, class or nationality. 

 The Assembly shall therefore above all recognize its sacred duty to maintain  full and complete unity throughout the Baha'i community, to relieve and comfort  the sick and distressed, to assist the poor and destitute, to protect the orphans, the crippled and the aged, to educate the children of Baha'is according to the highest religious and intellectual standards, to compose  differences and disagreements among members of the community, to promulgate the principles of Divine Civilization revealed  by Baha'u'llah, and to promote in every way possible the Baha'i aim of the oneness of mankind. It shall faithfully and devotedly uphold the general Baha'i activities and affairs initiated and sustained by the National Spiritual Assembly. It shall cooperate wholeheartedly with other local Spiritual Assemblies throughout North America in all matters declared by the National Spiritual Assembly to be of general Baha'i importance and concern. It shall rigorously abstain from any action or influence, direct or indirect, that savors of intervention on the part of a Baha'i body in matters of public politics and civil jurisdiction. 

 It shall encourage intercourse between  the Baha'i community of the City of New York and other recognized Baha'i communities, issuing letters of introduction to Baha'is traveling from New York and passing upon letters of introduction issued by other Baha'i Assemblies. lit shall regard its authority as a means of rendering service  to Baha'is and non-BahS'is and not as a source of arbitrary power. 'While retaining the sacred right of final decision in all matters pertaining to the Baha'i community,  the Spiritual Assembly shall ever seek the advice and consultation of all members of the community, keep the community informed of all its affairs, and invite full and free discussion on the part of the community of all matters affecting the 

Faith.                    
                          
        ARTICLE V

QUEBEC

 2.     The Baha'is of the City of Montreal adopt this Corporation in order to supply proper legal status to their conduct of the affairs of a religious community which has had continuous existence for more than thirty years, being the first local Baha'i community established in Canada. During this period the community has been recognized, ed, encouraged and instructed in letters and cornlnunications sent by tAbdu'1-BahA, who, in one communication dated at Haifa, Palestine, February 21, 1917, and addressed CCT the believers of God and the maidservants s of the Merciful in the Dominion of Canada," expressed the wish that in the future Montreal may become so stirred, that the melody of the Kingdom may travel to all parts of the world from that Dominion n and the breaths of the Holy Spirit may spread from that center to the East and West of America." CAbdu~1~~BaM himself spent several days in this City during g the course of his visit to America in 1912. The Assembly has been recognized since the Ascension of tAbdu'1-Bah~ in letters sent by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. The Montreal Baha'i Community has been continuously and uninterruptedly represented by delegates in the Annual Meetings held by the recognized national Baha'i body of North America since the formation of that body in 1909. 

 The Spiritual Assembly is at present enrolled d in the list of local Spiritual Assemblies s recognized by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United 

States and Canada.

 3.     The Trustees, i.e., the Spiritual Assembly, , recognize that this action has been taken in full unanimity and agreement. 

 They acknowledge for themselves and on behalf of their successors the sacred meaning g and universal purpose of the Baha'i Faith, the teachings and principles of which fulfil the divine promise of all former revealed d religions.

States and Canada.         

 5.     The Spiritual Assembly, in the fulfilment  of its obligations and responsibilities under this Corporation, shall have exclusive jurisdiction and authority over all the local activities and affairs of the Baha'i community  of the City of Montreal, including paramount authority in the administration of this Corporation. It shall be responsible for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of all Baha'i teaching, whether written or oral, undertaken throughout the local community. 

 It shall make available the published  literature of the Faith. It shall represent  the community in its relations to the (ih' itnLs National Spiritual AssemMy, in its relation to the Guardiac of the Baha'i Faith, to other local BaLM communities, and to the general public in the City of Montreal. It shall be charged with the recognition of all applicants requesting membership in the local 

Baha'i community. It       

 shall pass upon the right of any and all members of the community whose membership is in ques-non to retain their status as voting members  of the community. It shall call the meetings of the Community, including the Baha'i Anniversaries and Feasts, the meetings of consultation, the Annual Meeting and the meeting for the election of delegates  to the Annual Meeting of the National 

Spiritual Assembly. It     

 shall appoint  and supervise all committees of the Baha'i community. It shall collect and disburse all funds intended for the maintenance of this Corporation.

  quested, the membership roll of the Baha'i community, for the information and approval  of the national Baha'i body. 

 The Spiritual Assembly, however, shall recognize the authority and right of the National Spiritual Assembly to declare at any time what activities and affairs of the Baha'i community of the City of Montreal are more than local in scope and hence subject to the jurisdiction of the National Spiritual Assembly. 

 It shall likewise recognize the right of any member of the community to appeal to the National Spiritual Assembly for review and decision of any matter in which the previous decision of the local Spiritual Assembly is felt by the member to be contrary to the explicit teachings of the Baha'i Faith or opposed to its best interests.  It shall, on the other hand, have the authority and right to appeal from the decision of the National Assembly to the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith for review and final decision of any matter related to the Faith in the 

City of Montreal.      

 6.     The Spiritual Assembly, in administering  this Corporation, shall ever bear in mind the ideals upheld in the Sacred Writings of the Baha Faith respecting the relationships of a Spiritual Assembly to its Baha'i community, respecting the relations of Baha'is to one another in the community, and the relationships of Baha'is to all non-BabA'is,  without prejudice of race, creed, class or nationality. 

 The Assembly shall therefore above all recognize its sacred duty to maintain full and complete unity throughout the Baha'i community, to relieve  and comfort the sick and distressed, to assist the poor and destitute, to protect the orphans, the crippled and the aged, to educate the children of Baha'is according to the highest religious and intellectual standards, to compose differences and disagreements among members of the community,  to promulgate the principles of

Spiritual Assembly     

 to be of general Baha'i importance  and concern.

 It shall encourage intercourse between the Baha'i community of the City of Montreal and other recognized Baha'i communities, issuing  letters of introduction to Baha'is traveling from Montreal and passing upon letters of introduction issued by other Baha'i Assemblies. 

 It shall regard its authority as a means of rendering service to Baha'is and non-Bahi'is and not as a source of arbitrary power. 'While retaining the sacred right of final decision in all matters pertaining to the Baha'i community, the Spiritual Assembly shall ever seek the advice and consultation of all members of the community, keep the community informed of all its affairs and invite full and free discussion on the part of the community of all matters affecting the Faith.

<p329>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH           329

  period the community has been recognized, encouraged and instructed in letters and communications sent by tAbdu'1-Bah~ who iii one communication dated at Haifa, Palestine, February 21, 1917 and addressed "To the believers of God and the maidservants  of the Merciful in the Dominion of Canada" expressed the wish ccthat in the future Montreal may become so stirred, that the melody of the Kingdom may travel to all parts of the world from that Dominion and the breaths of the Holy Spirit may spread from that center to the East and 'West of 

America." cAbdu~1~ Bah&    

 himself spent se½ral days in this city during the course of his Visit to 

America in 1912. The Assembly

 has been recognized since the Ascension of ~Abd'1Bh' in letters sent by the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. 

 The Montreal Baha'i Community has been continuously and uninterruptedly represented by delegates in the Annual Meetings held by the recognized national Baha'i body of North America since the formation of that body in 1909. 

The Spiritual  Assembly   

 is at present enrolled in the list of local Spiritual Assemblies recognized by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and 

Canada.                    

 The Trustees, i.e., the Spiritual Assembly, recognize that this action has been taken in full unanimity and agreement. They acknowledge for themselves and on behalf of their successors the sacred meaning and universal purpose of the Baha'i Faith, the teachings and principles of which fulfil the divine promise of all former revealed religions. 
                           
         ARTICLE 3                  
                           
    Policy of Corporation.     

 In administering the affairs of the Babi'i Religion under this Corporation for the benefit of the Baha'is of the City of Montreal in accordance with the religious teachings and administrative principles of this Faith, the Spiritual Assembly  shall act in conformity with the functions of a local Spiritual Assembly as defined in the ByLaws adopted by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of the United States and Canada and published  by that body for the information and guidance of Baha'is throughout the United States and Canada. 

         ARTICLE 4                  
                           
   Powers and Duties. The     

 Spiritual Assembly,  in the fulfilment of its obligations and responsibilities under this Corporation, shall have exclusive jurisdiction and authority  over all the local activities and affairs of the Baha'i community of the City of Montreal, including paramount authority in the administration of this Corporation. It shall be responsible for maintaining the integrity  and accuracy of all Baha'i teaching, whether written or oral, undertaken throughout the local community. It shall make available the published literature of the Faith. 

 It shall represent the community  in its relations to the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, to other local Baha'i communities, and to the general public in the City of Montreal. 

 It shall be charged with the recognition of all applicants requesting membership in the local Baha'i community. It shall pass upon the right of any and all members of the community whose membership is in question to retain their status as voting members of the community.  It shall call the meetings of the community, including the Baha'i Anniversaries and Feasts, the meetings of consultation,  the Annual Meeting and the meeting for the election of delegates to the Annual Meeting of the National Spiritual Assembly. 

 It shall appoint and supervise all committees of the Baha'i community. It shall collect and disburse all funds intended  for the maintenance of this Corporation.  It shall have full and complete custody of the headquarters or meeting place of the Baha community. It shall report to the National Spiritual Assembly annually, or when requested, the membership roll of the Baha'i community, for the information and approval of the national Baha'i body. The Spiritual Assembly, however, shall recognize the authority and right of the National Spiritual Assembly to declare at any time what activities and affairs of the Baha'i community of the City of Montreal are more than local in scope and hence subject to the Iurisdiction of the National Spiritual Assembly. It shall likewise recognize the right of any member of the community to appeal to the National Spiritual Assembly for review and decision


<p330>
330             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of any matter in which the previous decision of the local Spiritual Assembly is felt by the member to be contrary to the explicit teachings of the Baha'i Faith or opposed to its best interests. 

 It shall, on the other hand, have the authority and right to appeal from the decision of the National Assembly to the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith for review and final decision of any matter related to the Faith in the City of Montreal. 
                           
        ARTICLE 5                  
                           
    Powers and Duties. The     

 Spiritual Assembly,  in administering this Corporation, shall ever bear in mind the ideals upheld in the Sacred 'Writings of the Baha'i Faith respecting the relationships of a Spiritual Assembly to its Baha'i community, respecting the relations of Baha'is to one another in the community, and the relationships of Baha'is to all non-Bahi'is, without prejudice of race, creed, class or nationality. 

 The Assembly  shall therefore above all recognize its sacred duty to maintain full and complete  unity throughout the Baha'i community,  to relieve and comfort the sick and distressed, to assist the poor and destitute, to protect the orphans, the crippled and the aged, to educate the chil —  dren of Baha'is according to the highest religious and intellectual standards, to compose  differences and disagreements among members of the community, to promulgate the principles of Divine Civilization revealed  by Baha'u'llah, and to promote in every way possible the Baha'i aim of the oneness of mankind. It shall faithfully and devotedly uphold the general Baha'i activities and affairs initiated and sustained by the National 

Spiritual Assembly. It     

 shall cooperate wholeheartedly with other local Spiritual Assemblies throughout North America in all matters declared by the National Spiritual Assembly to be of general  Baha'i importance and concern. 

 It shall rigorously abstain from any action or influence, direct or indirect, that savours of intervention on the part of a Baha'i body in matters of political and civil jurisdiction. It shall encourage intercourse between the Baha'i community of the City of Montreal and other recognized Baha'i communities, issuing letters of introduction to Baha'is traveling from Montreal and passing upon letters of introduction issued by other Baha'i Assemblies. 

 It shall regard its authority as a means of rendering service to Baha'is and non-Bah&is and not as a source of arbitrary power. 'While retaining the sacred right of final decision in all matters pertaining to the BM'i corn-munity,  the Spiritual AssemlAy shall ever seek the advice and consultation of all members of the community, keep the com-nituniry informed of all its affairs, and invite full and free discussion on the part of the community of all matters affecting the Faith.

THE INSTITUTION OF THE
               MAS U RI QU' LAD HK AR

 Visible Embodiment of I/se Universality of the Faith of Baha'u'llah  

                      FOREWORD

  ANY discerning minds have testified to the profoundly significant change which has taken place during recent years in the character of popular religious thinking. 

 Religion  has developed an entirely new emphasis, more especially for the layman, quite independent of the older sectarian divi —  slons. 

 Instead of considering that religion is a matter of turning toward an abstract creed, the average religionist today is concerned with the practical applications of religion to the problems of human life. Religion, in brief, after having apparently lost its influence in terms of theology, has been restored  more powerfully than ever as a spirit of brotherhood, an impulse toward unity, and an ideal making for a more enlightened civilization throughout the world. 

 Against this background, the institution of the Mashriqu'1 — Adhk&r stands revealed as the supreme expression of all those modern religious tendencies animated by social ideals which do not repudiate the reality of spiritual  experience but seek to transform it into a dynamic striving for unity. The Masliri-qu'1  — Adhkir, when clearly understood, gives the world its most potent agency for applying mystical vision or idealistic aspiration to the service of humanity. It makes visible and concrete those deeper meanings and wider possibilities of religion which could not be realized until the dawn of this uni-versa1  age. 

 The term ~ means literally, ttDawning~place of the praise of God." 

 To appreciate the significance of this Baha'i institution, we must lay aside all customary ideas of the churches and cathedrals  of the past. The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar fulfills the original intention of religion in each dispensation, before that intention had become altered and veiled by human invention and belief. 

 The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is a channel releasing  spiritual powers for social regeneration because it fills a different function than that assumed by the sectarian church. 

 Its essential purpose is to provide a community meeting-place for all who are seeking to worship God, and achieves this purpose by interposing no manmade veils between the worshiper and the Supreme. 

Thus, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar

 is freely open to people of all Faiths on equal terms, who now realize the universality of Baha'u'llah in revealing the oneness of all the Prophets. 

 Moreover, since the Baha'i Faith has no professional clergy, the worshiper entering the Temple hears no sermon and takes part in no ritual the emotional effect of which is to estab —  lish a separate group consciousness. 

 Integral with the Temple are its accessory buildings, without which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar would not be a complete social institution.  These buildings are to be devoted to such activities as a school for science, a hospice, a hospital, an asylum for orphans. Here the circle of spiritual experience at last joins, as prayer and worship are allied directly  to creative service, eliminating the static subjective elements from religion and laying a foundation for a new and higher type of human association.

   THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

                  MASHRIQU'L ADHKAR

            A LETTER FROM SHOGHI EFFENDI

  The    Beloved of the Lord and the Handmaids  of the Merciful throughout the United States and 

Canada.                    

  My well-beloved friends: Ever since that remarkable manifestation of Baha'i solidarity and self-sacrifice which has signalized the proceedings of last year's memorable Convention, I have been expectantly  awaiting the news of a steady and continuous support of the Plan which can alone ensure, crc the present year draws to its close, the resumption of building operations  on our beloved 

Temple.                    

 Moved by an impulse that I could nor resist, I have felt impelled to forego what may be regarded as the most valuable and sacred possession in the Holy Land for the furthering of that noble enterprise which you have set your hearts to achieve. With the hearty concurrence of our dear 

Baha'i brother, Ziaoulhh   

 Asgarzadeh, who years ago donated it to the Most Holy Shrine, this precious ornament of the Tomb of Baha'u'llah  has been already shipped to your shores, with our fondest hope that the proceeds  from its sale may at once ennoble and reinforce the unnumbered offerings of the American believers already accumulated on the altar of Baha'i sacrifice. 

 I have longed ever since to witness such evidences of spontaneous  and generous response on your part as would tend to fortify within me a confidence that has never wavered in the inexhaustible vitality of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in that land. 

 I need not stress at this moment the high hopes which so startling a display of unsparing devotion to our sacred Temple has already aroused in the breasts of the multitude  of our brethren throughout the East. Nor is it I feel necessary to impress upon those who arc primarily concerned with its erection the gradual change of outlook which the early prospect of the construction of the far-famed Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in America has unmistakably occasioned in high places among the hitherto sceptical and indifferent towards the merits and the practicability of the Faith proclaimed by Baha'u'llah. Neither do I need to expatiate upon the hopes and fears of the Greatest Holy Leaf, now in the evening of her life, with deepening shadows caused by failing eyesight and declining strength swiftly gathering about her, yearning to hear as the one remaining solace in her swiftly ebbing life the news of the resumption of work on an Edifice, the glories of which she has, from the lips of tAbdu'1-Bah~ Himself, learned to admire. I cannot surely overrate  at the present juncture in the progress of our task the challenging character of these remaining months of the year as a swiftly passing opportunity which it is in our power to seize and utilize, ere it is too late, for the edification of otir expectant brethren throughout the East, for the vindication in the eyes of the world at large of the realities of our Faith, and last but not least for the realization of what is the Greatest  Holy Leaf's fondest desire. 

 As I have already intimated in the course of my conversations with visiting pilgrims, so vast and significant an enterprise as the construction of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West should be supported, not by the munificence of a few but by the joint contributions  of the entire mass of the convinced followers of the Faith. 

 It cannot be denied that the emanations of spiritual power and inspiration destined to radiate from the central Edifice of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will to a very large extent depend upon the range and variety of the contributing  believers, as well as upon the nature and degree of self-abnegation which their unsolicited offerings will entail. 

 Moreover, we should, I feel, regard it as an axiom and guiding principle of Baha'i administration that in the conduct of every specific Baha'i activity, as different from undertakings of a humanitarian, philanthropic, or charitable character, which may in future be con

  ducted under Baha'i auspices, oniy those who have already identified themselves with the Faith and are regarded as its avowed and unreserved supporters should be invited to join and collaborate. For apart from the consideration of embarrassing complications which the association of nonbelievers in the financing of institutions of a strictly Baha character may conceivably engender in the administration of the Baha'i community of the future, it should be remembered that these specific Baha'i institutions, which should be viewed in the light of Baha'u'llah's gifts bestowed upon the world, can best function and most powerfuly exert their influence in the world only if reared and maintained solely by the support of those who are fully conscious of, and are unreservedly submissive to, the claims inherent in the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. In cases, however, when a friend or sympathizer of the Faith eagerly insists on a monetary contribution for the promotion of the Faith, such gifts should be accepted and duly acknowledged by the elected representatives of the believers with the express understanding that they would be utilized by them only to reinforce that section of the Baha'i Fund exclusively devoted to philanthropic or charitable purposes. For, as the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah      

 extends in scope and in influence, and the resources of Baha'i communities correspondingly multiply, it will become increasingly  desirable to differentiate between such departments of the Baha'i treasury as minister to the needs of the world at large, and those that are specifically designed to promote the direct interests of the Faith itself.  From this apparent divorce between Baha'i and humanitarian activities it must not, however, be inferred that the animating  purpose of the Faith of Baha'u'llah stands at variance with the aims and objects of the humanitarian and philanthropic institutions  of the day. 

 Nay, it should be realized by every judicious promoter of the Faith that at such an early stage in the evolution  and crystallization of the Cause such discriminating and precautionary measures are inevitable and even necessary if the nascent institutions of the Faith are to emerge triumphant and unimpaired from the present welter of confused and often conflicting interests with which they are surrounded. 

 This note of warning may not be thought inappropriate at a time when, inflamed by a consuming passion to witness the early completion of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, we may not oniy be apt to acquiesce  in the desire of those who, as yet uninitiated  into the Cause, are willing to lend financial assistance to its institutions, but may even feel inclined to solicit from them such aid as it is in their power to render. Ours surely is the paramount duty so to acquit ourselves in the discharge of our most sacred task that in the days to come neither the tongue of the slanderer nor the pen of the malevolent may dare to insinuate that so beauteous, so significant an Edifice has been reared by anything short of the unanimous, the exclusive, and the jeif-sacrificing strivings of the small yet determined  body of the convinced supporters of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 How delicate our task, how pressing the responsibility that weighs upon us, who are called upon on one hand to preserve inviolate the integrity and the identity of the regenerating Faith of Baha'u'llah, and to vindicate on the other its broad, its humanitarian, its all —  embracing principles! 

 True, we cannot fail to realize at the present stage of our work the extremely limited number of contributors qualified to lend financial support to such a vast, such an elaborate and costly enterprise. We are fully aware of the many issues and varied Baha'i activities that are unavoidably held in abeyance  pending the successful conclusion of the Plan of Unified Action. We are only too conscious of the pressing need of some sort of befitting and concrete embodiment of the spirit animating the Cause that would stand in the heart of the American Continent  both as a witness and as a rallying center to the manifold activities of a fast growing  Faith. 

 But spurred by those reflections may we not bestir ourselves and resolve as we have never resolved before to hasten by every means in our power the consummation of this all-absorbing yet so meritorious a task? 

 I beseech you, dear friends, not to allow considerations of number, or the consciousness of the limitation of our resources, or even the experience of inevitable setbacks


<p396>
396             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  which every mighty undertaking is bound to encounter, to blur your vision, to dim your hopes, or to paralyze your efforts in the prosecutiOn of your divinely appointed task. 

 Neither, do I entreat you, to suffer the least deviation into the paths of expediency  and compromise to obstruct those channels of vivifying grace that can alone provide the inspiration and strength vital not oMy to the successful conduct of its material construction, but to the fulfillment  of its high destiny. 

 And while we bend our efforts and strain our nerves in a feverish pursuit to provide the necessary means for the speedy construction  of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar's, may we not pause for a moment to examine those statements  which set forth the purpose as well as the functions of this symbolical yet so spiritually potent Edifice? It will be readily admitted that at a time when the tenets of a Faith, not yet fully emerged from the fires of repression, are as yet improperly defined and imperfectly understood, the utmost caution should be exercised in revealing the true nature of those institutions which are indissolubly associated with its name. 

 Without attempting an exhaustive survey of the distinguishing features and purpose of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, I should feel content at the present time to draw your attention  to what I regard as certain misleading statements that have found currency in various  quarters, and which may lead gradually to a grave misapprehension of the true purpose and essential character of the Mash-riqu'1  — Adhk4r. 

 It should be borne in mind that the cern tral Edifice of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, round which in the fulness of time shall cluster such institutions of social service as shall afford relief to the suffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the bereaved, and education to the ignorant,  should be regarded apart from these Dependencies, as a House solely designed and entirely dedicated to the worship of God in accordance with the few yet definitely prescribed principles established by Baha'u'llah  in the KITAB-I-AQDAS. It should not be inferred, however, from this general statement that the interior of the central Edifice itself will be converted into a conglomeration of religious services conducted along lines associated with the traditional procedure obtaining in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other temples of worship. Its various avenues of approach, all converging  towards the central Hall beneath its dome, will not serve as admittance to those sectarian adherents of rigid formuk and manmade creeds, each bent, according to his way, to observe his rites, recite his prayers, perform his ablutions, and display the particular symbols of his faith within separately defined sections of Baha'u'llah's Universal 

House of Worship. Far     

 from the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar offering such a spectacle of incoherent and confused sectarian observances and rites, a condition whoiiy in —  compatible with the provisions of the Aqdas and irreconcilable with the spirit it inculcates, the central House of Baha'i worship, cnshrined within the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, will gather within its chastened walls, in a serenely spiritual atmosphere, only those who, discarding forever the trappings of elaborate and ostentatious ceremony, are willing worshippers of the one true God, as manifested in this age in the Person of Baha'u'llah. 

 To them will the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar symbolize the fundamental verity underlying the Baha'i Faith, that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine  Revelation is not final but progressive. Theirs will be the conviction that an all-loving  and ever-watchful Father Who, in the past, and at various stages in the evolution  of mankind, has sent forth His Prophets as the Bearers of His Message and the Manifestations of His Light to mankind, cannot at this critical period of their civilization withhold from His children the Guidance which they sorely need amid the darkness which has beset them, and which neither the light of science nor that of human intellect and wisdom can succeed in dissipating. And thus having recognized  in Baha'u'llah the source whence this celestial light proceeds, they will irresistibly  feel attracted to seek the shelter of His House, and congregate therein, unhampered  by ceremoniaL and unfettered by creed, to render homage to the one true God, the Essence and Orb of eternal Truth,


<p397>
INSTITUTION OF THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR 397

  and to exalt and magnify the name of His Messengers and Prophets 'Who, from time immemorial even unto our day, have, under divers circumstances and in varying measure,  mirrored forth to a dark and wayward world the light of heavenly 

Guidance.                  

 But however inspiring the conception of Baha'i worship, as witnessed in the central Edifice of this exalted Temple, it cannot be regarded as the sole, nor even the essential, factor in the part which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar,  as designed by Baha'u'llah, is destined  to play in the organic life of the 

Baha'i community. Divorced 

 from the social, humanitarian, educational and scientific pursuits  centering around the Dependencies of the 

Mashriqu'l-Adhkar Baha'i   

 worship, however exalted in its conception, however passionate in fervor, can never hope to achieve beyond the meager and often transitory  results produced by the contemplations of the ascetic or the communion of the passive worshipper. 

 It cannot afford lasting satisfaction and benefit to the worshipper himself, much less to humanity in general, uniess and until translated and transfused into that dynamic and disinterested service to the cause of humanity which it is the supreme privilege of the Dependencies of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to facilitate and promote. 

 Nor will the exertions, no matter how disinterested and strenuous, of those who within the precincts of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will be engaged in administering the affairs of the future Baha'i Commonwealth, fructify and prosper unless they are brought into close and daily communion with those spiritual agencies centering in and radiating from the central Shrine of the Mashriqu'1-. Adhk~r. 

 Nothing short of direct and constant  interaction between the spiritual forces emanating from this House of Worship centering  in the heart of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and the energies consciously displayed  by those who administer its affairs in their service to humanity can possibly provide the necessary agency capable of removing the ills that have so long and so grievously afflicted humanity. For it is assuredly  upon the consciousness of the efficacy  of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, reinforced on one hand by spiritual communion with His Spirit, and on the other by the intelligent application and the faithful execution  of the principles and laws He revealed, that the salvation of a world in travail must ultimately depend. And of all the institutions that stand associated with His Holy Name, surely none save the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar can most adequately provide the essentials of Baha'i worship and service, both so vital to the regeneration of the world. Therein lies the secret of the loftiness, of the potency, of the unique position of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar as one of the outstanding institutions conceived by Baha'u'llah. 
     Dearly-beloved friends!    

 May we not as the trustees of so priceless a heritage, arise to fulfill our high destiny?

TLI1HE Columbian Exposition

 or World's Fair, held in Chicago in 1893, stands peerless  and unique in the realm of world expositions. 

 Its location unexcelled for beauty, built in a spacious park with overshading trees and wide green lawns, and on the shore of Lake Michigan, each building  of white stucco, an architectural gem, it stood in all its majestic beauty, to all who beheld it a never-to-be-forgotten joy and inspiration. 

 When approached by water on Lake Michigan, especially when lighted at night, the electric lights outlining the buildings and silhouetting them against the sky seemed like a heavenly vision — like the vision  of St. John's of the "Holy City beside the tideless sea."

  Throughout the grounds flowed entrancing  lagoons which were fed from Lake Michigan, the water passing under a great peristyle which rose high above the water and formed the entrance to the Fair from the Lake, facing the East. Entering the Fairgrounds at this point in a launch, one rode under this great colonnade and entered the ~Court of Honor" of the Exposition. At the top of this arched gateway was a large group of figures, of chariots and horsemen,  at the base of which was in letters of gold: "Ye shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free." 

 These words were readable from the inside of the ccCort of Honor"; the fact that it faced the West was most significant in that one must face the East when reading it, and one saw the promise of the coming of the Truth from the East. 

 In the midst of all this beauty and perfection of art and the gathering together of all the races and nations of the earth, was held the first tWld' 

Parliament of Religions"   
ever held in America.      

 For the first time the different races and religions met on a common footing and each listened with a respect and open-mindedness to his brother's presentation of his religious Faith. The scene of a Catholic Cardinal (Cardinal Gibbons) and a Hindu Swami (Swami Vivekananda) walking arm in arm into the hail where the Parliament was held, foreshadowed the coming of the ~tGreat Day of God" when the ccKiioWledge of the Glory of God shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea," foretold by Prophets of old, when unity and iove shall reign upon this earth. 

 The following excerpt taken from the official record of the ~~Proceedings of the 'World Parliament of Religion," held in Chicago, 1893, Vol. II, page 1124, is of vital interest to all Baha'is. It reads: ccOn the thirteenth day of this Parliament,  the afternoon session September 23rd, a paper on the tReligious Mission of the English 

Speaking People' by Reverend

 H. Jessup, D.D. of Beirut, Syria was read; Reverend L. C. Mercer (Swedenborgian) in the chair, (Foot note — Henry Harris Jessup, born 1832. 

Director of Presbyterian   

 Missionary  operations in North Syria; Missionary ary of Tripoli, Syria in 1856. Was removed to 

Beirut in 1860. Author     
of The Mohammedan  Missionary

Problems.')"               

 The subject of Dr. Jessup's paper, which was read by Reverend George A. Ford of Syria, was as given above and the following excerpts are taken from it: "The four elements  which make up the power for good in the English Speaking Race, and fit it to be the divine instrument for blessing the world are: 

    1 — The Historic Planting    
and Training.              

    2 — The Geographic Position. 
   3 — The Physical, Social     

 and Political traits of the English speaking people. 

   4 — The Moral and Religious  

 character and training of those nations." 

 (Each was discussed at some length.) 

  The paper ended thus: CCThis then is our mission; that we who are made in the image of God, should remember that all men are made in God's image. 

 To this divine knowledge we owe all we are, all we hope for. 'We are rising gradually toward that Image and we owe it to our brother men to aid them in returning to it in the Glory of God, and the Beauty of Holiness. 

 It is a celestial privilege and with it comes a high responsibility, from which there is no escape. 

 CCJ~ the palace of Baha'i, or Delight, just outside the Fortress of tAkki, on the Syrian  coast, there died a few months since a famous Persian 

Sage, the Bab Saint       

 named Baha'u'llah, the tGl of God,' the head of that vast reform party of Persian Moslems,  who accept the New Testament as the Word of God and Christ as the Deliverer of men, who regard all nations as one, and all men as brothers. Three years ago he was visited by a Cambridge scholar, and gave utterance to sentiments so noble, so Christlike, that we repeat them in our closing words: tThat all nations should become one in Faith and all men as brothers; that the bond of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease and differences of race be annulled; what harm is there in this? Yet, so it shall be. These fruitless

  strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the "Most Great Peace" shall come. Do not you in Europe need this also? 

 Let not a man glory in this that he loves his country;  let him rather glory in this that he loves his kind.'" At this session of the 

Parliament, on September  
23, 1893, the name of      

Baha'u'llah, the Glory     

 of God, was first heard in the Western world, and to those who today realize the Station of Baha'u'llah, this fact is surrounded with spiritual significance. 

 It would seem that the whole Fair had been prepared by God to be a Throne upon which the "Glory of God" descended, and the golden letters on the face of the peristyle held a divine and prophetic meaning: CtYe shall know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free." For the Spirit of Truth which should lead mankind "into all Truth," manifested through Baha'u'llah had upon that day been proclaimed. 

 Thus Chicago  was the chosen city to be crowned with this great honor. 

   Of Chicago, in a Tablet    

 to the believers of the Central States of America, CAbdu~1~ Baha wrote, in part: "God specializes for His 

Mercy whomsoever  He NVilleth."

 (CQ ye old believers and intimate friends! 

 ttTh twelve States are like the heart of America, and the heart is connected with all the organs and parts of man. If the heart is strengthened all the organs, of the body are reinforced, and if the heart is weak all the physical structures are subjected  to feebleness. 

 ~tNOW praise be to God that Chicago and its environs, from the beginning of the diffusion  of the Fragrances of God, have been a strong heart. Therefore, through Divine Bounty and Providence it has become confirmed  in certain matters. 

 ~ Call of the Kingdom was in the very beginning raised in Chicago. This is indeed a great privilege, for in the future centuries and cycles, it will be an axis around which the honor of Chicago will revolve. 

 eesecondA number of souls with the utmost firmness and steadfastness, arose in that blessed spot in the promotion of the Word of God, and even to the present mo ment, having purified and sanctified the heart from every thought, they are occupied  with the promulgation of the Teachings of God. Hence the Call of praise is uninterruptedly raised from the Supreme Concourse. 

 re7jhirdDuring the American journey Abdu'l-Baha several times passed through Chicago and associated with the friends of God. 

 For some time He sojourned in that city. Day and night He was occupied with the mention of the True One and sum —  moned the people to the Kingdom of God. 

 repO     to the present time every movement initiated in Chicago, its effect was spread to all parts and to all directions; just as everything that appears in and manifests  from the heart influences all the organs and structures of the body. 

 erFifthThe first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in America was instituted in Chicago, and this honor and distinction is infinite in value. Undoubtedly out of this Mashriqu'l-Adhkar thousands of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar's will be born." 

 Also tAbdu'1-Bahi has said: "All the inhabitants of the world are in these days engaged  in warfare and strife, but the friends of God are striving with heart and soui to lay the basis of the Palace of the Kingdom; so that the call of prayers and supplications may ascend to the heights of heaven. 

 The flowers of material and divine civilization shall grow in the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar perfuming  the nostrils with the Fragrances of Truth. 

 Its doors will be opened before the face of all nations, religions and sects. Whosoever  enters therein is welcomed. 

 Baha'u'llah  is the Universal Shepherd. All mankind are His sheep, and the adherents of all religions are welcomed in the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, to worship the Father of all humanity  with perfect freedom, reverence and obedience." 

 Another interesting fact which seems to be correlated with the Baha'i Temple of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar spiritually, and showing why it should be built in the environs  of Chicago, is found in a book entitled 

"Reminiscences of Early    

 Chicago" by E. 0. Gale, in which we find this quotation  from a letter written by the grave and distinguished Explorer, Robert CavAlier de


<p401>
INSTITUTION OF THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR 401

  La Salle, to a friend in France in 1682 which reads: "After many toils I came to the head of the great Lake and rested for some days on a bank of a river of feeble current, now flowing into the Lake, but which occupies the course that formerly these great Lakes took as they flowed southward to the Mississippi River. This is the lowest point in the great divide between two great valleys of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi. The boundless regions of the West must send their products to the coast through this point. 

 This will be the ~Gate of the Empire,' this the seat of Commerce. Everything invites to action. The typical man who will grow up here must be enterprising. 

 Each day as he arises he will exclaim ~ act, I move, I push" and there will be spread before him a boundless horizon, an illimitable field of activity. A limitless expanse of plain is here. To the East is water and at all other points land. 

 If I were to give the coming city a name I would derive it from the nature of the place and the nature of the man who will occupy this place; Ago — I Act, and Circum — all around, 

Circago."                  

 This prophecy of La Salle's given in 1682, when "wilderness was king" has, as all who have seen or read about Chicago know, been literally fulfilled and the spiritual significances  of his words ever grow greater as one considers them. Truly no city in the world could so materially express all that the Baha'i Temple stands for as does Chicago, or the name given to it by the French Explorer: ttCircago, — I Act all Around." 

 One point he emphasizes means much, "To the East is water and at all other points land." What a deep spiritual truth is here symbolized. 

 Water, the symbol of Spirit; and the East, the Rising Point of the Sun of Truth. All other points are but material ones and are refreshed and enlightened from the One 

Point.                     

 Again he states that, (cIt is the lowest point in the great divide." 

 The lowest point in a circle of existence is next to the first point of ascent, and from the manger comes forth the 

Christ-Child Consciousness.

 Chicago stands like a great hub in a wheel; from every side are incoming railroads roads and navigation lines; to all the world she exports material foods, and is fast be-coining  a center of sciences, arts and educational  institutions. 

 A Spiritual Reality is back of this material reflection, and thus the Temple with its accessories will manifest  these truths Spiritually. It will "act all around," with its nine avenues of approach to its sacred heart, or hub. Within this Temple all peopies will be welcomed regardless  of color, race or creed, and there they may commune with God, coining away reinforced and putting forth the fruits of that holy communion in Deeds. For one of the fundamental principles of the Teachings  of Baha'u'llah is that 'twork is worship," and ttMan is judged by his deeds and not his words." 

 The accessories or surrounding buildings connected with the Temple, and which as a whole constitute the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, will be an outward expression of this truth; here the "fruits of the Spirit" in material expression will be manifest. From these accessories will be given forth knowledge, comfort, healing and enlightenment along all lines, free to all. Not oniy spiritual food will be given forth from the Temple, but material help to those in distress, regardless of race or religion. 

 The Temple will stand high above all the other buildings which surround it and when completed can be seen by all outgoing and incoming mariners. 

 At this point is the drainage canal's entrance through which the pure waters of Lake Michigan flow to purify the city — another symbol of the Spiritual Reality of the Water of Life, or Word of God, which will flow forth from this Sacred Edifice to give new Life to the world. 

 As Chicago is the "melting pot" of all nations, so will the Temple be the great ~~Spiritual Melting 

Pot" of Divine Love. Consuming

 all racial and religious differences  and intolerances, all prejudices and bigotry, and melting the hearts into one substance and remolding them into spiritual realities which recognize oniy the per.-feet  brotherhood of man, the oneness of the world of humanity, wherein all are children of the One Everlasting Father whose 

Name is Love.

  Interior Decoration of Center of Dome of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at Wilmette, Ill., U. S. A. Never do the eyes of the writer rest upon the model of the Temple designed by the inspired architect, Louis Bourgeois, that she does not bow her head as before a sacred shrine in profound and deep reverence. The emanation of the "Holy Presence" is so truly felt, the Reality of the Manifestation so apparent, that it is like a great chord of heavenly music, the ttLost Chord" found again, which lifts the soul to higher realms above all that is petty and sordid, discordant  and unreal, into the very tCCt of the Almighty," and attunes the heart with the Infinite. Its perfection of form is, in itself, a glorious symphony; the very music of the spheres seems to have been drawn into con —  Crete expression, to bless the lives of men. Its beauty is so ethereal, yet so majestic and sublime, that one stands before it in silence, for words fail to describe its spiritual perfection, its divine loveliness. 

 It carries one to realms which CC above world and letters  and transcend the murmur of syllables and sounds." 

 On first beholding a picture of the model it impressed me as being formed like a great Bell, and upon writing to Mr. Bourgeois of this fact he replied: t¶[ am glad you caught this vision of the Temple. 

 A bell is the most wonderful of all musical instru

  ments; it rings throughout man's life from the cradle to the grave. It rings at a christening,  it calls a child to its meals, to school — to church later in life. 

 It rings in time of danger, for fire and to warn the sailors at sea. It rings for a wedding and it tolls for a funeral. 

 It rings from the town clock marking off the hours of each day and night. 

 It calls one to his front door, to his telephone and to numerous other activities. It rang for the Declaration of Independence  — the Great Liberty Bell — and I too feel that the Temple is a great Bell calling humanity to unity and reconciliation,  to brotherhood and ided commonwealth. 

 Proclaiming the liberation of humanity  from the bondage of superstition and ignorance, and announcing his spiritual freedom." 

 This brought to the writer's mind the words of Baha'u'llah addressed to Napoleon ~ King of Paris! Tell the priests nor to ring the bells. By God the True 

One! The Most Glorious     

 Bell hath appeared in the Temple of the Most Glorious Name, and the fingers of the Will of thy Lord, the High, the Supreme, ring It in the world of Eternal Power, through His Most Splendid Name." 

 The invisible Bell of the Temple is the Voice of Baha'u'llah, calling to the hearts of men to unite the world over, and manifest  the Love of God, calling man to that (cReality of Unity" of which our beloved cAbdu~1~Bah& so often spoke. 

  There are so many deep emotions which this marvelous creation calls forth from one's innermost being, that new symbolisms are daily being revealed which lead the soul into the very "HOlY of Holies" and into the Court of which Baha'u'llah has written: "The pen cannot step into this Court and the ink gives no result but blackness." 

 Truly this Temple is the one foreseen by the Prophets of old; the one promised in this CrGreat Day of God" — the Temple Beautiful — the vision of the Holy Ones of all religions, CCcome true." Blessed are they who arise to obey Its Call, and assist in Its erection. 
                           
          THE FIVE BILLION CARAT GEM BAHA'I
            TEMPLE AT WILMETTE, ILLINOIS

  B~ F. S. YOUNG Published in The Mineralogist, January, 1936 J Nthe January, 1934 issue of The Miii-eralo  gist, attention was called to the Baha'i Temple, located at Wilmette, Illinois, both to the mineralogical interest and architectural  beauty of this noted structure. 

 This beautiful edifice is rapidly nearing completiOn as shown in the accompanying photographs.  It might be justly referred to as the world's most gorgeous and largest gem stone" as the entire structure is being faced with quartz crystal. Some 743 tons of quartz will be required to face the dome of the Temple and an additional amount used to face the remainder of the lower portions. 

 The Temple is equivalent in height to a fifteen story building, the dome being one of the five largest in the world. 

 The Temple architect, Louis Bourgeois, designed the structure as a Temple of Light and beneath the quartz tracery the dome is encased in glass. Two varieties of quartz are being used in the construction, one a clear crystal and crystalline and the other of darker opalescent type. 

 The crystalline quartz is reduced to sizes equivalent to about eight carat gem stones, while the opaque quartz is ground much finer. These two materials are then mixed to make Earley's concrete, a material lighter than stone, stronger than concrete and impervious to the elements. The nature of the material and construction will in the future not require the periodical cleaning as is the case with many similar edifices. 

 The crystalline quartz facing of the structure gives a beautiful sparkling effect either in direct sunlight or under artificial light, making the Temple visible for many

  miles. The crystal and crystalline quartz was obtained at King's Creek, Spartanburg, South Carolina, and the opalescent material from Moneta, Virginia. 

 The decorative design of the completed Temple embodies the curved lines described by the planets moving through their orbits and a farseeing feature of construction given consideration by the architect is the appearance of the Temple when viewed from aircraft. The Temple appears as a huge scintillating star and will act as a beacon  for airplanes stopping at Chicago. 

 In the geometric forms of the ornamentation are represented religious symbols used by all peoples of the world, including the Swastika cross, the 

Circle, the Triangle       

 and the double Triangle or Six-Pointed Star (Solomon's Seal — the magic symbol of necromancers of old). 

 But more than this, the noble symbol of the spiritual orb, or sun behind the Savior of mankind; the five-pointed  Star, representing the man Savior-Christ or Buddha or Muhammad; the Greek Cross, the Roman or Christian Cross, and supreme above all is the nine-pointed Star, figured in the structure of the Temple itself, and appearing again and again in its ornamentation as significant of the spiritual glory of the world today. 

 Mr. H. Van Buren Magonigle, past president  of the American Federation of Arts, writes of the Temple as follows: "It has been necessary for me as the architectural member of your advisory board, to adlust myself to an unusual point of view. 

 Mr. Bourgeois has conceived a Temple of light in which structure as usually understood is to be concealed, visible support eliminated as far as possible, and the whole fabric to take on the airy substance of a dream; it is a lacy envelope enshrining an idea, the idea 

MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR    405   

  of light, a shelter of cobweb interposed between earth and sky. It is necessary then for your advisory board to place themselves at once in an attitude of respect for this beautiful idea and applying the fruits of experience, bend the practical to the esthetic, with sympathetic understanding, in the endeavor  to assist to the utmost the realization of the creator's dream.~~ It is not at all beyond conception to assume that this beautiful Temple marks a new era in architectural beauty, which will eventually be used universally and that it is creating national attention is indicated by the thousands of visitors who have signed the Temple register. 

 A new and inspiring approach to the solution  of Universal Peace is made possible through the teachings of Baha'u'llah so it is said, and the Temple is being erected to send forth the message of 'ove and peace to all mankind. With a war ridden world struggling to recuperate from the many past conflicts and nations again ready to spring at the throats of their neighbors, the Baha'i Temple stands as a monument of hope to all mankind. 

 May the light of this brilliant architectural gem, radiate to the darkest corners of the earth and instill an understanding in the hearts of all men, both rich and poor, that War does nor pay. 

 "We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the Nations; that all Nations shall become one in faith and all men as brothers in the bonds of affection; and unity between the sons of men shall be strengthened; that diversity of religion shall cease and differences of race be annulled. So it shall be, these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the Most Great Peace shall come." — Baha'u'llah.

406             THE BAHA'I WORLD

         TEMPLE ECHOES FROM THE WORLD'S FAIR
                 B~ DR. ZIA BAGDADI

  The Baha'i Temple: !A befitting and concrete embodiment of the spirit animating the Cause standing in the heart of the American continent both as a witness and as a rallying ng center to the inanif old activities of a fast growing Faith." — SHOGHI EFFENDI. 

  NVHEN the Century of Progress Exposition  was opened in Chicago a year ago, the Baha'is used this opportunity to acquaint the people with the significance of the Baha'i Faith, first, by giving occasional lectures  at the Hall of Religions, and later by placing an exhibit in a prominent place in the heart of the Hall of Religions. As the writer was one of the many volunteers who had the privilege of assisting in this service he wishes to set forth a few of the features which distinguished the Baha'i exhibit from the others; to repeat some of the questions often asked by thousands of visitors and to give brief answers to them; and to report some incidents observed and remarks repeatedly  heard, all of which indicate public reaction toward the Baha'i Movement and its Temple. In this way the readers of the Baha'i Magazine may get a comprehensive idea of the fulfillment of CAbdu~1~Bah4~s promises, especially in regard to the influence  of the Temple on mankind during the~ days of the greatest exposition ever known to man. 

  To the Baha'is the World's Fair means a century of spiritual progress as well as material  progress; to others it means material progress oniy. Baha'is demonstrated the instruments of universal peace — remedies for all human ailments and problems, the means for the establishment of Divine Civilization. 

 Others demonstrated the newest machines and most modern devices of industry, agriculture and transportation. Baha'is attributed this century's miraculous progress and achievements to no other reason  than the coming of the Promised One of all nations — the Glory of God, Baha'u'llah.  Others attributed success, discoveries, inventions and the advancement of science to human endeavors oniy, unaware of the Source of all inspiration. In their exhibit, accordingly, the Baha'is had only one aim, — to convey a heavenly message which brings true happiness, real prosperity, and permanent security to all mankind. This heavenly message was embodied in a small model of the beautiful Baha Temple, made by Mr. Louis Voelz of Kenosha, Wisconsin.  The chaste beauty of this miniature  temple held the attention of many and a Baha'i was always at hand to explain how the principles of world unity and brotherhood  for which the Temple stands, are, through the power of Baha'u'llah, the remedy  for the sick world. 

  ccWhat is the purpose of the Baha'i Temple?" 

 was one of the first questions asked by those who paused to examine the Temple model. To this we answer in Abdu'l-Baha's own words: ccremples are the symbols of the reabty and divinity of God — the Collective Center of mankind. Consider how within a temple every race and people is seen and represented;  all in the presence of the Lord, covenanting  together in a covenant of iove and fellowship; all offering the same melody, prayer and supplication to God. 

 Therefore it is evident that the church is a collective center of mankind. 

 For this reason there have been churches and temples in all the divine religions." 

 At one time tAbdu'1-BahA impressed upon me the importance of building the Temple. It was in the year 1920, in the city of cAkk4 in the Holy Land, as we were passing in front of a very old church. 

 He stopped suddenly and pointing to it called my attention  to the fact that were it not for that little church not one of the followers of the


<p407>
INSTITUTION OF THE MASHRIQU'L — ADHKXR 407

  Christian Faith could be found or seen in the city. No other power on earth than this humble church could protect and unite such a small community of Christians for more than thirteen hundred years in a Muhammadan land under fanatic and despotic rulers. 

 Another question commonly asked was: "Why build such a costly building when the huge sum of money now being spent on its ornamentation could be used for material benefits to mankind?" To this we reply that it is for the benefit of all mankind and for nothing else that the Temple has been built in the utmost beauty. 
Baha'u'llah has said:     

~ Concourse of Creation!  

 0 People!  Construct homes (or Houses of Worship) in the most beautiful manner possible in every city, in every land, in the name of the Lord of Religions. Then commemorate thy Lord, the Merciful. Verily by this commemoration, the breasts shall be dilated, the eyes illuminated, the hearts gladdened." 

 Few people yet realize that the remedy for this sick world must have a spiritual foundation. 

 In speaking of the erection of this Temple tAbdu'1-Bab~ has said: "Its building is the most important of all things. This is the spiritual foundation; for that reason it is the most important of all foundations;  from that spiritual foundation will come forth all manner of advancement and progress in the world of humanity." 

  This leads us to another question often asked: CtJ~ what way does the Baha'i Tern-pie  differ from other temples and churches, and how can one expect more benefit from this one temple than from others?" Those who give only a passing glance at the Tern-pie  may carelessly speak of the design as oriental, but those who inspect it even briefly see that the design is new and unique. Indeed, according to the master minds of world famed architects and engineers the Baha'i Temple is "the first new idea in architecture since the thirteenth century." The idea behind it and for which it stands is equally new — the idea of the unity of mankind and of the essential oneness of all religions. In the words of the architect of the Temple, the late Mr. Louis Bourgeois, c!the Baha'i Movement is the fusing of the essential spirituJ elements of all religions and all philosophies." Explaining further he says: t~Into this new design, then, of the Temple, is woven, in symbolic form, the great Baha'i teaching of unity — the unity of all religions and of all mankind." 

 The Baha'i Temple, so exquisite and perfect  in all the details of its conception and execution, so perfectly symbolic of unity, is a most powerful influence in bringing the people into a consciousness of the need of world unity and of the vitalizing power of the teachings of Baha'u'llah. Shoghi Effendi helps us to understand this when he says, "it is assuredly upon the consciousness of the efficacy of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, reinforced on the one hand by spiritual communion with His spirit, and on the other by the intelligent application and the faithful execution of the laws He revealed, that the salvation of a world in travail must ultimately depend." 

  "How is the building of the Temple financed?" 

 Many of the Fair visitors who went to Wilmette to see the Baha'i Temple and attended the meetings, found to their amazement that there was no such thing as a money collection, returned to us with this question, "Who pays for the building of the Temple and from where does the money come to run the affairs of the Movement?" 

 Our answer is simply this: That the Baha'is throughout the world have the reputation of being a self-sacrificing people. They do not ask material rewards for their services rendered for the sake of God and humanity. 

 They have no priesthood and clergy to support. 

 Therefore joyously and generously they are ready at all times to contribute according to their best ability to carry on their transactions and support the administration of the Cause. 

 "Truly I say," tAbdu'1-BaM once wrote, "the friends of God (that is, the Baha'is) display wonderful generosity in regard to the contributions for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar (the Temple) ." This spirit of sacrifice has been especially noteworthy among the friends in the Orient. In regard to this 'Abdu'l-Baha said, "Until this day an event of this character has never transpired, that


<p408>
408    THE BAHA'I WORLD
  The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at CJ4~qib~d TurkistAn.

  from the East and Asia contributions were forwarded to the West for the building of a temple. Verily this is a cause of astonishment for the people of perception." 

  CCDO the Baha'is believe in Christ?" was another question asked many times. 

 To those who are familiar with the Baha'i Teachings this query seems strange indeed. We assure all that the Baha'is believe in Christ and in all the divine Messengers of God. 

 "Baha'u'llah established Christ in the East," said tAbdu'1-Bahi. ttHe has praised Christ, honored Christ, exalted Him, called Him tthe Word of God,' cthe Spirit of God,' raised the name of Christ to supreme summits  of glorification. 

Throughout the Orient     

 Baha'is have illumined the lamp of Christ and spread His mention.~~ Besides these and other questions which were asked many interesting incidents occurred.  One of the most striking was as follows: One day a handsome young man stopped and after gazing at the model his face flushed, his eyes sparkled and with a voice intense with emotion he said, "Do you know that this Temple has saved my life! You see I am a flier, and once while returning to Chicago during a severely stormy night I was lost because nothing below was visible. I became desperate and prayed. 

 Soon after I saw the light through the dome of the 

Baha Temple. Then I       
knew where I was."         

 One Sunday afternoon a family of three came from some distance to attend the Service in the Foundation Hall of the Tem-pie.  They had heard about the Temple and wished to know for what it stood. After the service they expressed their extreme happiness over what they had heard and wished to come again as they had missed part of the talk. One of the group added that he had been a seeker all his life and his soui was hungry for just such a message as he had heard. 

 The next Sunday they were present again and this same man publicly announced, with sincere devotion and great happiness, his faith in the Baha'i Cause. Since then the members of this family of three have been rendering important services to the Cause. 

 During the past summer a gentleman from a distant city heard that "sun worshippers  are building a temple at Wilmette, near Chicago!" When he finally went to Chicago, just for curiosity's sake, he went to see the Temple. 

 He was so impressed by the Temple and the Baha teachings that after further investigation he declared himself a believer in the Baha'i 

Revelation.               

 In short, many are those who through

          THE BAHA'I TEMPLE — AN APPRECIATION

               B~ DR. REXFORD NEWCOMB

  Dean of College of Fine and Applied Arts, University of Illinois ARCHITECTURE is, and always has been, an index to the life and thought of an age or a race. Throughout history the aims, the ambitions, the ideals of mankind have been built into those structures which man in his strength has reared to symbolize his relationship to his fellow man or his relationship to what he considered God. 

 Man is, and always has been, incurably religious and prodigiously inventive. 

 His earliest monuments were shelters to shield his body from the elements, but almost as early came some sort of a sanctuary in the sacred precincts of which he attempted through certain rites of propitiation to make whatever contact he might with those unseen forces which he felt ruled and guided his destinies. 

 Thus the early house sym —  bolized the brotherhood of man, the temple the sonship of man to whatever God may be. 

 in the design of the Baha'i Temple on the shores of Lake Michigan ' the late Louis Bourgeois, beloved of man generally and of artists and architects in particular, has con —  ceived a temple which at once symbolizes the brotherhood of man and his kinship to God. Framed of steel, the constructive material of modern architecture, but clothed with a protective covering of concrete to withstand the ravages of the elements, this "Temple of Light" opens upon the terrain 1 Wdmette near Chicago, 

Ill.                       

 of human experience nine great doorways which beckon men and women of every race and clime, of every faith and conviction, of every condition of freedom or servitude to enter here into a recognition of that kinship and brotherhood without which the modern world will be able to make little further progress. 

 Entering these portals, one comes presently  into a great lofty central space, the aspiring structural lines of which, reaching from the lower planes of human relationship,  as symbolized by the outlying wings of the temple, gracefully, yet with assurance,  contrive to define the triumphantly beautiful dome that crowns the struc —  ture. 

 The dome, pointed in form, aiming as assuredly as did the aspiring lines of the medieval cathedrals toward higher and better things, achieves not oniy through its symbolism but also through its structural propriety and sheer loveliness of form, a beauty not matched by any clomical structure since the construction of Michelangelo's  dome on the Basilica of Saint 

Peter in Rome.             

 Thus this building points out through its symbolism that out of the yearnings, the hopes, the aspirations of man there comes the recognition of the essential oneness of mankind, the oneness of Godhead, and the essential continuity and unity of all human experience.

           A TEMPLE OF UNIVERSAL RELIGION

 B~ D. M. NORTHCROFT In The Inquirer, London, Jan. 19, 1935 ALTHOUGH very little notice has been taken of the event by the Press of this country, a significant epoch in the trend towards 

Universalism in Religion  

 took place in America early in 1930. 

 This was the opening of the first Ba1i~'i Temple of Worship for all Religions, in the western world, the foundation of which was laid a few years ago by tAbdu'1-BaM, the interpreter and expounder of the Baha'i teachings to the western race. 

 The Temple is situated in the city of Wilmette, on the beautiful shores of Lake Michigan, a short distance from Chicago. 

 It is a noble edifice and original in form. 

 The Temple stands 186 feet high, and is composed of a steel, reinforced concrete and glass framework, over which is a lacelike design, sculptured from quartz stone, mixed from a medium of white cement. The re-suit  is a surface harder and more enduring than rock, and at the same time carrying an intricate design as delicate as lace. 

 The glass roof and sides protect the interior from the weather, and the light enters through the open design of the ornamentation.  When floodlit and viewed from an aeroplane at night the Temple appears as a gigantic nine-pointed star. 

 Nine is the number of perfection and the basic principle of Unity, the keynote of the Baha'i teachings, consequently the Tem-pie  is a nine-sided building standing in nine acres of park land, planted with trees and flowers. 

 Each of the nine sides of the Tern-pie  is in the form of a circular arc, with a large doorway in the centre, the whole edifice  giving the appearance of extending welcoming arms to worshippers of all nations approaching from every direction. 

 Surely the nine entrances symbolize the various pathways by which man travels in his search after Truth, but which can all converge in the 

Universal Focal Point.    

 'When the Temple is completed a series of buildings will be erected in the surrounding  park, a hospital, an orphan asylum, a hospice or house of hospitality, a University, etc., demonstrating that ~~religion is an attitude  towards God reflected in life" — only worship can be voiced in the Temple itself; but the results of such worship are to be evidenced in the surrounding buildings where all activities of the community will meet in comradeship inspired by mutual counsel. 

 Entering one of the nine doors, the visitor passes through a hallway into the central dome-shaped auditorium, capable of seating about 700 people. 

 Looking upward towards the dome, two galleries, one above the other, are visible. Above the second (or singers') gallery is a nineteen foot clerestory, from which springs the dome. 

 Out of the main hail open radially (sepa-rated  by the hallways) nine smaller rooms, comparable to chapels in a cathedral, and able to hold about 100 people in each. 

 In the geometric forms with which the interior of the Temple is decorated, all the religious symbols of the world are represented  — the five-pointed star embodying the Man Saviour (Christ, Buddha, Muhammad), the Greek and Roman crosses, the swastika cross, the circle, the triangle, and the double triangle or six-pointed star, and supreme over all and constantly recurring through the scheme of decoration, the great nine-pointed  star, emblem of the unification of all religions. 

 This beautiful and impressive building is a universal house of worship built by the Baha'is of the United States of Canada, with the help of Baha'is from practically every race and nation in the world. 

 The Temple will be open to people of all religions, sects and races, and is dedicated to the Oneness of God and the oneness of man

  kind, the union of science and religion, to universal education and the fundamental unity of religions. 

 Its essential purpose is to provide a community meeting-place for all who are seeking to worship God, and achieves this purpose by interposing no manmade veils between the worshipper and the Supreme. Thus, the central hail is freely open to people  of all Faiths on equal terms, expressing in this the universality of Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha faith, who affirmed the fundamental oneness of all the prophets. Since there are to be no priests the worshipper per entering the Temple will hear oniy the words of Baha'u'llah chanted or read. There will be no sermons and no ritual. 

 A wonderful prophecy concerning the future of Religion was made by the son of Baha'u'llah, cAbd~1Bhi when he laid the foundation stone of this Temple: t~The ages of darkness have passed away and the Century of Light has arrived. 

 The differences which exist among the nations and the peoples  are soon to pass away, and the fundamentals  of the divine religions, which are no other than the solidarity and the oneness of the human race, are to be established." 
                           
            "CONCRETE FULFILLS A PROMISE"

  B~ JOHN J. EARLEY, ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTOR Published in a 1934 issue of "Architectural Concrete" AT the same time that the building for the Department of Justice was being done in our Washington studio, the great dome of the Baha Temple at Wilmette, Ill., 

 was being done in our Rosslyn plant. This tem-pie,  designed by Louis Bourgeois, was intended  by him to be the symbol of a new religion founded in Persia some seventy years ago. Mr. Bourgeois wished to design a tern-pie  as new in form and treatment as the religion that it symbolized. He did not wish it to be reminiscent of other styles of architecture associated with other and older faiths. 

 He designed a nine-sided temple with a perforated dome, as intricate in design and as delicate in execution as a piece of lace. In doing this, he called for the skill of the best craftsmen and for a material of marvelous flexibility. This dome is now completed; why concrete was used and how it was used is a story in itself. 

 Sufflc~ it to say here that the dome was executed beautifully and faithfully with architectural concrete and with economy possible  only through the use of a plastic material. 

 When concrete is rationally and skillfully used, there can be no doubt of its economy. Economy is of the nature of concrete. 

 It is a plastic material and the principle is generally recognized that it takes iess force, less work, less money or whatever term you will, to form a plastic than to form a solid material. 

 A plastic material requires a mold to give it form. 

 This mold or form is the great test of ingenuity of the craftsman in the use of concrete. About a business generation  ago, a few engineers designed structural elements which could be duplicated in the same form. This permitted one set of forms to be used for several stories of construction,  and it effected an economy that gave a real impetus to the use of concrete in industrial buildings. Now we are in another  period, and again the practice of a few shows the ~way to methods that will in turn become general practice. 

 Further economy in forming has been effected by using plastic materials for the forms themselves  and by the still more radical departure of omitting the forms. Let me emphasize the fact that such methods of forming are


<p414>
414             THE BAnAl WORLD

  not just something to be discussed, nor something to be desired, nor something to be expected in the future; on the contrary, they are an accomplished fact. 

 In the Department of Justice building the concrete finish comprised the forms in which the structural beams and slabs of the ceiling were placed. In this way the finish for the structure was the form for the structure and was thereby integrally incorporated  in it. Remember, this is not theory, but practice. 

 For the dome of the Baha'i Temple, the problem was to build an intricate, lace-like design in concrete. 

 The forming of such a structure with wood or similar materials would have placed on concrete a handicap of cost such as in all probability it would never have been able to carry. The molds of this structure were made of plaster of paris, or calcined gypsum, a plastic material which by proper technique could be made to meet all the requirements of such a complicated design. 

 They were made with economy, with a minimum of labor, and were maintained in such good working condition that all necessary duplication for the construction of the dome was made in one set of forms. 

 In closing, permit me to state that in presenting this thesis I have been unconscious  of any effort to appeal to emotion. I have, on the contrary, endeavored to present simple facts and examples to show that concrete is beautiful, that beautiful concrete  is economical and that it is an architectural material. Finally, I have stated that such an architectural material should Airplane View of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at Wilmette, Ill., U. S. A.

BAHA CALENDAR AND
                     FESTIVALS
                      FOREWORD

  B~ DR. J. E. ESSLEMONT 

          From Baha'u'llah and the New Era

  AMONG different peoples and at different  times many different methods have been adopted for the measurement of time and fixing of dates, and several different calendars  are still in daily use, e.g., the Gregorian in Western Europe, the Julian in many countries of Eastern Europe, the Hebrew among the Jews, and the Muhammadan in Muslim countries. 

 The Bab signalized the importance of the dispensation which He came to herald, by inaugurating a new calendar. 

 In this, as in the Gregorian Calendar, the lunar month is abandoned and the solar year is adopted. 

 The Baha'i year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e., 361 days), with the addition  of certain tcilltercalary days" (four in ordinary and five in leap years) between the eighteenth and nineteenth months in order 

     BAHA'I FEASTS, AND DAYS   

 to adjust the calendar to the solar year. The Bab named the months after the attributes of God. 

 The Baha'i New Year, like the ancient Persian New Year, is astronomically fixed, commencing at the March equinox (March 21st), and the Baha'i era commences with the year of the Bab's declaration  (i. e., 1844 Alt, 1260 Ad-I.). 

  In the not far distant future it will be necessary that all peoples in the world agree on a common calendar. 

 It seems, therefore, fitting that the new age of unity should have a new calendar free from the objections and associations which make each of the older calendars unacceptable to large sections of the world's population, and it is difficult to see how any other arrangement could exceed in simplicity  and convenience that proposed by the Bib.

           BAHA'I HOLY DAYS ON WHICH WORK
                 SHOULD BE SUSPENDED

  The first day of RisivAn, The ninth day of Ridvan, The twelfth day of Ridvan, The anniversary of the declaration of the BTh, The anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah, The anniversary of the birth of the BTh, The anniversary of the ascension of Baha'u'llah, The anniversary of the martyrdom of the Bab, 

             The Feast of Naw-Riiz.

 NOTE:  tAbdu'1-Bah6., in one of His Tablets addressed to a believer of Nayriz, Pin, has written the following: ~tNine days in the year have been appointed on which work is forbidden. Some of these days have been specifically mentioned in the Book. The rest follows as corollaries to the Text. Work on the Day of the Covenant (F&e Day of CAbd~1Bh~) however, is not prohibited. Celebration ration of that day is left to the discretion of the friends. Its observation is not obligatory. The days pertaining to the Abhi Beauty (Baha'u'llah) and the Primal Point (the Bib), that is to say these nine days, are the oniy ones on which work connected with trade, commerce, industry and agriculture is not allowed. In like manner, work connected with any form of employment, whether governmental or otherwise, should be suspended." 

  As a corollary of this Tablet it follows that the anniversaries of the birth and ascension of tAbdu'1-Bah4 are not to be regarded as days on which work is prohibited. The celebration of these two days, however, is obligatory. 

  Baha'is in East and West, holding private, should exert the utmost superiors to enable them to observe administrative positions, whether public or effort to obtain special leave from their these nine holy days.

               ING THE BAHA'I CALENDAR

'THE Badic Calendar (Baha'i

 Calendar) has been taken by inc from the Kitab-i-Aqdas'," one of the works written by the Bab. As I have observed in these days that certain believers are inclined to regard the year in which Baha'u'llah departed from Baghdid to Constantinople as marking the beginning of the Badit Calendar, I have requested  Mirza Aq~ J~tn, the amanuensis of Baha'u'llah, to ascertain His will and desire concerning this matter. Baha'u'llah answered  and said: ~The year sixty A.H. (1844 A.D.), the year of the Declaration of the Thib, must be regarded as the beginning of the Bad? 

Calendar.' The Declaration 

 of the Bab took place on the evening preceding the fifth day of Jam6xliyu'L-Avval, of the year 1260 A.H. It has been ordained that the solar calendar be followed, and that the vernal Equinox, the day of Naw-Riiz, be regarded as the New Year's Day of the Badit Calendar. 

 The year sixty, in which the fifth day of Jarn~idiyu'1-Avva1 coincided  with the sixty-fifth day after Naw-Riaz,  has accordingly been regarded as the first year of the Badit Calendar. As in that year, the day of Naw-Riiz, the vernal Equinox,  preceded by sixty-six days the date of the Declaration of the Bib, I have therefore, throughout my history, regarded the Naw

He has The Mb has regarded the    ordained  the month of solar year, of 365 days,   tA1A' to be the month of 5 hours, and fifty odd     fasting, and has decreed minutes, as consisting     that the day of NAWRUZ of 19 months of 19 days    should mark the termination each, with the addition    of that period. As the of certain intercalary     BTh did not specifically


<p421>
BAHA'I CALENDAR AND FESTIVALS                                421

 define the place for the four days and the fraction of a day in the Bad? 

 Calendar, the people of the Baycin were at a loss as to how they should regard them. The revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas in the city of tAkk~ resolved this problem and settled the issue. Baha'u'llah designated those days as the ~ and ordained that they should immediately precede the month of tAh', which is the month of fasting. He enjoined upon His followers to devote these days to feasting, rejoicing, and charity. Immediately upon the termination of these intercalary days, Baha'u'llah ordained the month of fasting to begin. I have heard it stated that some of the people of the Baydn, the followers of Mirza Yahy&, have regarded  these intercalary days as coming immediately after the month of tAIA', thus terminating their fast five days before the day of Naw-Riiz. This, notwithstanding the explicit text of the Baydn which states that the day of Naw-Rfiz must needs be the first day of the month of Baha, and must follow immediately after the last day of the month of cA1A~. Others, aware of this contradiction, have started their fasting on the fifth day of the month of tAh' and included the intercalary days within the period  of fasting. 

 Every fourth year the number of the intercalary days is raised from four to five. The day of Naw-R& falls on the 21st of March only if the vernal Equinox precedes the setting of the sun on that day. 

 Should the vernal Equinox take place after sunset, Naw-Riiz will have to be celebrated on the following day. 

 The Bab has, moreover, in His writings, revealed in the Arabic tongue, divided the years following the date of His Revelation, into cycles of nineteen years each. The names of the years in each cycle are as follows: 

1.   Alif                  
2.   Bi'                   
 3. Ab

Most Luminous.             
Unity.                     

 Each cycle of nineteen years is called Vihid. 

 Nineteen cycles constitute a period called Kull-i-Shay'. 

 The numerical value of the word ttVAhid" is nineteen, that of ~ " is 361. (cVA1id~~ signifies unity, and is symbolic of the unity of God. 

 The Bab has, moreover, stated that this system of His is dependent upon the acceptance  and good-pleasure of CCHim Whom God shall make manifest." One word from Him would suffice either to establish it for all time, or to annul it forever. 

 For instance, the date of the 21st of April, 1930, which is the first day of Ridvan, and which according to the Kitab —  iA qdas must coincide with the "thirteenth day of the second Baha'i month," and which fell this year (1930) on Monday, would, according to the system of the Badi~ Calendar, be described as follows: "The day of Kamil, the day of Qudrat, of the month of JalAl, of the year Bahh6j, of the fifth Vahid, of the first Kull-i-Shay'."

YOUTH ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT
                  TUE BAUKI WORLD
                    BAHA'I YOUTH

   An Estimate and Survey of International Events

  1934 to 1936 

                  B~ MARION HOLLEY

  TODAY it is no longer necessary to define the world's condition. 

 The pressure of years, now almost seven, of steady social disintegration accompanying and feeding upon our economic chaos, has weighed upon the native optimism of us all, until in honest dismay we have come to admit a predicament. 

 The privileges which seemed ours for the taking have vanished; neither desire nor urgent need seem likely to restore  them. 

 The universe, once so friendly, evinces a marked disinterest in our affairs, ignores our suggestions, proceeds calmly to its own destiny while we writhe in ours. 

 Clearly, human society has an existence of its own, a power of choice apart from the necessity of nature which, underestimated and abused, has attained sudden prominence by leading us into our present unhappy state. 

 In an environment potentially adequate, with unique equipment of intellect and energy, we of the human race are nevertheless free to starve, kill, and misuse  our fellows and ourselves. It is a situation we should brand as improbable except that it surrounds us. In this confusion of 1936, all are victims alike, for the disruption and perversion of social institutions proceeds as virulently in Europe as in America, in Asia, Africa, and in most of the countries of the world. Scarcely a single constructive idea stands out against the prevailing drift. Young people, who are not historically patient, seem at as great a 'oss as their elders for an impulse toward the proper action. It is a stale, a sterile period; yet may it not be the propitious moment for deliverance — for the challenge of this extreme futility by a sound and vital program? 

 Three years ago in the summer of 1933, the National Spiritul Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada appointed a Youth Committee which, in an advisory capacity, was to aid in the spread and consblidation of the Baha'i Faith among young people. The scope of its work as later defined by Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Cause, was extended to the international field, for he wrote: ~tYou should not confine your activities to the national sphere but should strive to create under the supervision of your 

National Spiritual Assembly

 an international body of active young Baha'i men and women who, conscious of their manifold and sacred responsibilities, will unanimously arise to spread the Holy Word." 

(August, 1933)            

 This Committee, in its first general letter, named the dynamic which has motivated each subsequent act, that stirring ideal of world change which 

Baha'u'llah, the Manifestation 

 of the power and authority of God, released to reshape and renew our troubled society. ttThe world's equilibrium,"  Baha'u'llah affirmed, (Chath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new 'World Order. Mankind's ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed." 
426


<p427>
YOUTH ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE BAFLA'1 WORLD                    427

  To the support of this startling challenge ' — for Baha'u'llah's enunciation constitutes a mighty claim — the Youth Committee called its contemporaries. ttWe have grown firmly convinced that our destiny is indeed to live in the construction of a new world order, an order which must rise from and displace this helpless and decadent civilization.  Surely none of us would now deny that it is the task of this generation, of this Baha'i generation, to build the framework for that wonderful conception." (Baha'i News, November, 1933.) 

 The record of the response from Baha'i youth will form the substance of this survey. Because of the shortness of time since 1933, and the barriers of language and space which still intervene between American  youth and international groups, the record is incomplete. 

 On the other hand, the diverse activities of young Baha'is throughout the world cannot be attributed to the efforts of one committee. 

 The announcement,  be it remembered, was Baha'u'llah's and it has roused not oniy His immediate followers, but all those who are contributing in any way to the unfoldment of this destined plan. 
                           
BAHA STANDARDS AFFECTING  
          YOUTH                      

  The process of growth in the Baha'i community presents an interesting snjdy, for it assumes characteristic patterns and develops through phases of vitality which are original,  demanding, but absolutely necessary. There are periods in the process which, to outward seeming, are unproductive; yet in these times certain ideals are implanted which nourish the whole action that is to follow. There are insistent patterns which appear to limit and constrict growth; yet ultimately these form a solid base from which the community rises to unforeseen achievement. 

 That Baha'i youth are subject to the same conditions which govern the Baha'i community was one of the first discoveries of local youth committees. It was soon found that neither efficient nor ingenious plans for organization and teaching can ensure group success, apart from adherence to the will of Baha'u'llah. 

 Two standards in particular stand out as measures of youth work, and in these past two years every effort has been thwarted or confirmed according  to its conformity with them. 

 The first standard imposed by Baha'u'llah was that of character. ccWhoso ariseth among you to teach the Cause of his Lord, let him, before all else, teach his own self, that his speech may attract the hearts of them that hear him." The transformation of one's own life and the expression in deeds of that faith which is verbally professed is the primary obligation of every Baha'i. 

In 1934, Shoghi Eflendi    

 addressed the youth conference at Louhelen in these words: (CA tremendous responsibility has been laid upon you, and nothing short of a pure, a virtuous, an active and truly exemplary life can enable you to fulfill your high destiny." 

 This goal, so difficult of attainment, so alien to the prevailing customs and habits of society, was at first neglected by Baha'i youth. Perhaps it is fairer to say that it was overlooked, in their eagerness to win the attention and comradeship of other young people. 

 Some felt even a certain shyness at the thought of creating a sense of difference. 

 Today, however, that hesitance has passed and in its place is a growing sentiment in favor of frank, unqualified faithfulness to the ideals of Baha'i conduct. Baha'u'llah forbade the use of intoxicants and tAbdu'1-BaM  recommended the renouncing of tobacco. 

 More important, the virtues of honesty, courtesy, justice, dignity, tolerance, and kindliness were enjoined. 

 In a tablet to an American believer, 'Abdu'l-Baha emphasized the importance of chastity, because in the ocean of divine knowledge one particle of chastity is greater than ten thousand years of adoration." 

 And always he spoke of that greatest characteristic, love, the crown of human perfection. "The first bounty from the True One is love, unity and harmony," he said, t~and without these all the deeds pass in vain and give no result." 

 A gradual awakening to the profound import  of these instructions of the Manifesta-don  is the most significant present trend among young Baha'is. 

 In articles for the bulletin Baha'i Youth, in letters, in discus


<p428>
428              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  sion groups and on the public platform, these ideals are being stressed and this fact will surely hasten the day when ttthe Baha youth of America," in fulfillment of the National Assembly's urgent hope, "can be a source of inspiration to the numberless young people who are groping for a light in the darkness of the present chaos, and seeking a sure foundation upon which to build their lives." (Letter to the 

Youth Committee, November  
5, 1935.)                  

 The second standard set forth by Baha'u'llah  was unity. "In this wondrous Revelation,  this glorious century, the foundation of the Faith of God and the distinguishing feature of His Law is the consciousness of the Oneness of Mankind." 

 This principle extends into every aspect of society, uniting in a common destiny every class, race, religion, nation and temperament. 

 It is the basis for the new institutional life of man and it determines the form into which all institutions must develop. Yet at the time of the appointment of the Youth Committee, no one suspected its chief problems would be contributed by the operations of this standard. Abdu'l-Baha had written that iversality is of God and all limitations earthly." No one associated this divine principle with the mechanics of a youth movement. 

 In a sense the establishment of youth groups in the midst of Baha'i community life is incongruous. The rivalry of youth with age has enjoyed a long history and a peculiarly sterile one; it was not the intent of the National Assembly to perpetuate it. Some emphasis of teaching work among young people was required, however, together  with a more consistent effort to initiate Baha youth into community responsibility.  So the Youth Committee was created, but its energies for several months were diverted by an attempt first to define and later to abolish a conception of age limit. 

 Although that struggle is now past, the necessity for constant interpretation of function and adjustment remains. 

 For the problem which confronts Baha'i youth is one unknown to other youth organizations. 

 The methods which bring suc —  cess to these groups betray our deepest purposes. 

 No guidance can be obtained by studying them and no imitation can assist in a solution. 

 Rather what is demanded of young Baha'is is a fresh imagination, a profound  and mature originality, that they may conceive a new relationship for youth and age, and create, by identifying their aims with the larger ideals of the community,  a new integration. Thus their work will advance, not retard, the development  of an original society — Baha'u'llah's conception of an organic, all-embracing, world community. 

 Local groups have approached this problem  in various ways, sometimes failing altogether,  their expansion undoubtedly delayed; yet one cannot study their efforts without gaining confidence that finer relations  are being continuously established as each group strives toward a fuller consultation and more steadfast individual service under the leadership of its local Spiritual Assembly. 
                           
     AN ASSEMBLY OF YOUNG PEOPLE

  The spirit of the Baha'i Faith has, throughout its history, exerted a special attraction over young people. In Nabil's great narrative of the early days of the movement, The Dawn-Breakers, although no emphasis is laid upon youth, it is en-dent  upon every page that the first followers of the BAt, most of whom sealed their sincerity with martyrdom, were men under thirty. The BTh Himself, described as a t(Youth of radiant countenance," was but twenty-five when He announced His mission.  Nor is it unusual that His Cause should have found its chief champions among younger people, for the message of the Bab shattered traditions, evoked a deep idealism, and required daring for its spread. 

 Each of the Founders of the Faith was supported by a group of persons whose lives, activities, and ambitions were centered in the Prophet's will. 

 The Bab, in six brief years, created His heralds and sent them forth to rouse lr~n. By 1852, they had accomplished  their destiny and joined their Master. 
(He was martyred in 1850.) 

 The generation of believers in the Manifestation of Baha'u'llah formed another group who, for half a century, labored to establish His Cause. When in 1892, Baha'u'llah passed


<p429>
YOUTH ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE BAHA'I WORLD                     429

  on, His work was continued by CAbdu~ Bah&; it was the latter's special privilege to extend the influence of the Baha'i Faith into the western world. In France, Germany, England, and in America the news of this personage spread, exciting a great enthusiasm  in the hearts of innumerable men and women. 

 These, too, were often young; today  they continue to breathe into the local Assemblies a sense of the greatness of the Cause, teaching by their example that devotion  and reverence, that patient service which 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself so patiently taught to them. 

 But today i5 another day and a new epoch in the advance of the Cause. 

 It is the time which belongs, in history, to Shoghi Effendi, first Guardian and grandson of tAbdu'I-Bahi. It is the period of consolidation, of the establishment of that Administrative  Order which "will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not oniy as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fulness of time the whole of mankind." And Shoghi Effendi,  like his predecessors, is the center for the ardent hopes, the devoted services of a generation. 

 Youth! Today's youth, like the generations which have gone before, has found its destined field of action — the building of a world community. 

 It is, therefore, worthy of note that in Flint, 

Michigan, an Assembly      

 has been organized  which is composed solely of young people. ~tWe have not felt a need for a special Youth Committee as our Flint Ba-h&i  Assembly is made up entirely of young people, except for one member who has just been elected to the Assembly to fill a vacancy. Being a small community, we have set no age limits, because the three young people who exceed the age of twenty-five  years, by two or three years, are quite naturally a part of the youth group. There are nine Baha'is who are between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five." This was in September, ~93 5. 

 In November of the same year a letter was received: "Recently, we added six new believers to our community, which brings the total resident believers lievers to eighteen. God is good, and Baha'u'llah lives, today and always!" 

 In Flint the exhilaration which is felt in those words has been translated into thrilling  motion. 

 A dozen plans of teaching are used; there are afternoon and evening study classes; each week at least one open discus-srnn  is scheduled "where anyone is welcome to give his viewpoint in exchange for ours"; On Saturday night the community joins in recreation; nationally known teachers are invited to assist, and for them ~ arrange public meetings, group meetings, and private consultations, ahead of time so that there is a definite program to fill in every hour of their stay." This wide scope of activity bespeaks a vitality and singleness of purpose which will teach the Cause around the world. 
                           
  THE NEW HOUR IN TEACHING   

  There are, perhaps, few local Assemblies where a group of young Baha'is, by its own unaided efforts, has obtained the success of the Flint Assembly. 

 There are, however, innumerable local communities in which youth groups exist and prosper. In a survey made in the fall of 1935, twenty-eight organized groups were discovered in America. 

 In addition, in a total of sixty-one  localities there were young Baha'is from sixteen to twenty-five years of age. In most cases, these young people carry, aside from their youth activities, a responsible share in the general life of the community. They serve on committees, lead classes, take eager part in Feast consultations, are rapidly qualifying as public speakers, and assist  in the organization of inter-Assembly and teaching conferences. 

 But their chief opportunity lies in that special phase of teaching which is planned for youth. No other part of the Baha'i community is so fitted to undertake this work, for no one else understands quite so intimately the problems and modes of thinking of young people. 

 In this field the Baha youth of London seem to have achieved an outstanding success.  The News Letter from the Baha'is of the British Isles makes frequent mention of their programs which, during 1934 and 1935, included a monthly series of discus


<p430>
430              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  sion groups, a monthly series of public talks, and frequent social meetings. 

 There are now twenty-five active Baha'is and their numbers will no doubt increase as they deVise  fresh attractions. 

 In April, 1934, one hundred and fifty guests were entertained with a play and a brief exposition of the Faith. In August, a Summer School for youth was held. This group has also tried methods of publicity, the latest being a circular letter to a number of youth which included these sentences: t~'W believe that everyone looks today for a better order of things. 

 Many hopes and aspirations have sadly come to no result. 

 Our organization  is young, but it is born and bred on solid principles given to us more than sixty years ago. At a time when no one thought of International Cooperation, Baha'u'llah arose in IrAn, as the Promised One of all the Faiths, speaking of a world state and federation of mankind. 

 He proclaimed the basic oneness of all religions, and ordained equality of sexes, equal opportunity for all, universal education, and a fair solution of economic difficulties. We are following in His footsteps. You will find us a group of people who know what they want, and with faith in their work for making this earth a saner and more congenial place to live." 

 It has been the privilege of local youth groups, in the few years of their existence, to inaugurate a number of original teaching methods. 

 One which was initiated during 1935, with real success was the teaching team. 

 Today there are three such teams, the first begun in Los Angeles, followed by teams in San Francisco and New York. The method has been vividly described by Mr. Joseph Bray of San Francisco: CCWC call it the miniature symposium and it is working beautifully. 

 The way it works is this: some friend, a nonBahA'i, asks friends in to hear of the New World Order. 

 Usually four of us arrive and after everyone is settled, I start off with a talk of six or seven minutes on, say tThe Signs and 

Need of a New World Order.'

 Of course that's an easy subject because all one needs do is to read yesterday's or today's newspaper for material. At our last symposium Sylvia loas took up where I finished; Joyce 

Lyon                       

 gave a fine talk of six or seven minutes on ~The Three Great Figures of the Baha'i 

Faith'; Mardiyyih Carpenter

 finished with general remarks and led a very interesting discussion. 

 There are many advantages to this type of teaching work. In the first place, the guests and sincere inquirers are not bored with a talk of half an hour or longer on the part of one speaker; also there are presented several different points of view." Other teams speak with enthusiasm of the unity which is developed among the members, a unity which lends courage to each and is, for the Listeners, convincing. 

 In America the use of the intergroup conference has imparted great stimulation to the activities of individual Baha'is and youth groups. 

 Perhaps the most outstanding meeting  of this type, one which has become almost an institution, is the youth dinner held during each National Convention. 

 In 1934, the participants, numbering seventy-three, held a lively roundtable discussion of teaching  methods for young people, the report of which, carried in the international Bul-lain, reached Baha'i youth throughout the world. 

 Several localities are especially suited to these intergroup meetings. 

 New York, with outlying suburbs, neighboring communities, and Assemblies not too far away, scheduled a regional teaching conference in October, 1935, on the occasion of Riihi Effendi's visit to America. This proved so valuable that another conference was planned for the Christmas holidays, and invitations were sent to twenty-five Assemblies. 

 Both San Francisco and Los Angeles, on the west coast, on several occasions sponsored this same type of discussion with Baha'i youth from neighboring cities. But no region is so adapted to the inter-Assembly meeting as the central states and on the North Shore of Lake Michigan a number of conferences have occurred. 

 The participating  groups include Chicago, Kenosha, Ra-one,  Winnetka, Wilmette, Evanston, Urbana,  Peoria, 

Flint, and Milwaukee;      

 in 1935, they met at the Louhelen Summer School, in Winnetka in September, and in Peoria. Situated as these youth groups are in the near vicinity of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar their increasing strength is of

  great promise, bearing, it would seem, testimony to the Guardian's cabled message that the "forces which progressive revelation of this mighty symbol of our Faith is fast releasing in heart of a sorely-tried continent no one of this generation can correctly appraise."  (October, 193 5.) 

 From Assemblies throughout the world reports come of other youth groups, each with its specialized program and each contributing life to this far-flung Cause. Already  the units of the New World Order are assuming tangible form in these Assemblies;  their youth arc a guarantee of their perpetuation. 

 In Paris a group of 1r6nian students holds, according to one observer, ttbrilliant meetings."  In December, 1934, this union sponsored its fifth annual conference where the following subjects were considered: (1) The 

Baha'i Faith and World     
Politics, (2) The Baha'i   
Faith in PresentDay fran, 

(3)    Discipline, the Basis
of Liberty, and            

(4)    Patriotism and NVorld
Cooperation.               
        The Baghdid Youth Committee

 has t~wee1(1y study classes where the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Iqan are discussed, and talks on important subjects are given." 

 In 1934, a new group was organized in Sydney, Australia, by a former member of the Montreal Youth Group, Mrs. Poppoea Rickrnan. 

 On the island of Maui, in the Hawaiian group, a study class of thirty young people meets, and a large proportion of these youth are Japanese. 

 Hawaii, even more than the United States, is by virtue of its diverse races a unique laboratory for the proving of Baha'u'llah's teachings on the oneness of mankind. 

 Although I ninian youth activities form the subject of a later section of this paper, the news from Massoud Rassikh, a Baha'i student in the American University of l3ei-rut,  is appropriate here. In the summer of 1934, Mr. Rassikh and several friends formed in Qazvin a club of young people, Baha'is and others, Lor physical recreation. A tennis court was built in the garden of the Hazirat'1-Quds, thus making this Ba-h~'i center a point of general attraction. 

 Mention should be made, too, of the efforts  of Mrs. Gregory in Belgrade, 

Jugo                       

 slavia, who is teaching a class of six Russian students, and of Miss Alexander who, in Tokyo, is gradually reaching young peo-pie  through the medium of an English conversation class. 

 It is manifestly impossible to comment upon the activities of Baha'i youth in every Baha'i community throughout the world. But surely, in this scant survey, one may glimpse the power and energy of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, may perhaps be convinced that, as the Guardian has said, "the new hour has struck in (the) history of our beloved 

Cause."                    
                           
    THE SUMMER SCHOOLS         

  With the increased interest in youth work, partly as a result of the appointment of a National Youth Committee, and the wide expansion of functioning groups, it has become necessary to divide the United States and Canada into three large regions, thus better to understand and assist local action. This division, made by the National Committee to expedite its own business, grew naturally out of the fact that Baha have already concentrated their attention upon three centers: the Summer Schools at Green Acre, 

Louhelen and Geyserville. Just

 as the Baha communities have drawn fresh vigor each year from these institutions, so now Baha'i youth are taking more part and receiving as a consequence more training and inspiration. 

 In 1934, for the first time, a special youth conference was planned at Central States 

Summer School. Twenty-six  

 young Baha'is sponsored the move and the sessions were attended by almost fifty. 

 This group, before its dispersion, elected a Youth Coun-cii  which, with the Summer School Committee, was made responsible for the following  year's meeting. 

 In reply to an announcement of these facts, Shoghi Effendi  sent instructions in words which are of significance not only to the youth of Louhelen, but to all Baha'i young people who are making efforts in the path of Baha'u'llah. 

 "The work in which you are engaged is dear and near to my heart and constitutes one of the most vital aspects of the manifold activities of our beloved Faith. 

 The highest standards of purity, of


<p432>
432              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  integrity, of detachment and sacrifice must be maintained by the members of your group in order to enable you to play a decisive  part in the spread and consolidation of the Faith. A tremendous responsibility  has been laid upon you, and nothing short of a pure, a virtuous, an active and truly exemplary life can enable you to fulfil your high destiny. I will pray that you may be guided and strengthened to render the most effective service to the Cause and by your example lend a fresh impetus to the onward march of its newborn institutions." 

 The Youth Conference of 1935, four days in length and attended by sixty young people, carried forward the spirit set the preceding summer. 

 We quote from the letter sent by the Youth Council to Shoghi Effendi: "It is with great joy that we report  the completion of a most successful and happy Youth Conference. 

 The spirit of joy and cooperation among us has been continually present, with a deepening sense of responsibility and devotion to our beloved 

Faith.                     

 rtThe mornings have been devoted to classes. We opened with a devotional, in which various people were given an opportunity to serve; Mrs. Bishop Brown led the class on the CBa1~'i Approach to World Problems'; Mrs. Dorothy Baker spoke inspiringly on 'The Baha'i Life.' 

 The two classes which were held during the last period in the morning dealt with the Guardian's letters, for those who were well acquainted with the Baha'i teachings, and cWhat is the Baha'i Movement?' for those who were less familiar with them. The afternoons and evenings were mostly spent in recreation and informal gatherings — an excellent opportunity to become better acquainted  and to speak more intimately in regard to those Baha'i problems which lie closest to our hearts." 

 Under date of August 3, 1935, the Guardian replied: ~ am overjoyed to learn of the splendid work you have achieved, and particularly of the determination with which you have arisen to promote the best interests of our beloved Faith. 

 I will, from the depths of my heart, pray for the early and complete realization of your highest and dearest hopes. Rest assured, and persevere, however great the obstacles which you may have to face in the future or the disappointments which you must necessarily experience.  Your work will assuredly triumph." 
   The Summer Schools of      

Green Acre and Geyserville 

 have not as yet adopted the procedure  of a separate conference for youth. However, each of them has arranged certain  specialized sessions and in each, young Baha'is have made notable contributions to the program. It is still a question, at least in Geyserville, as to whether a Youth Conference  is desired; a feeling strong with many is that in some way, new and so f at untried, youth may win an important place in the program, discover especial functions, and enrich both themselves and the main body of the school by creating this higher integration. 

 At any rate, Geyserville holds a great challenge, for in 1935, a large group of children and youth were in attendance. There were, between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, some fifteen young people, seventeen who were from ten to fourteen years, and thirteen from seven to nine years. These children represent a potential reservior which, in the next few years, may be developed  to the honor of the Faith. At present, plans are already on foot to issue a small bulletin of Geyserville news for circulation among the Baha'i youth in western Assemblies. Such a paper will intensify interest, and may lead to the type of program  so deeply desired. 

 At Green Acre a weekend was devoted during the Summer School of 1934, to youth meetings. Three sessions were held for the discussion of world problems, as solved by Baha'u'llah. A costume ball and beach picnic were also arranged, and on Sunday morning the regular meeting was conducted by young Baha'is. At this school three of the adult courses were taught by Baha'i youth: Mary Maxwell on The Dawn-Breakers," Baha'i Lindstrom on !eThe 

Iqan," and David Hofman    

 with a discussion on ttpoposed Solutions of the Economic 

Problem."                  

 In 1935, although a second youth conference  was planned, it was not carried through, due to the small numbers who


<p433>
YOUTH ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE BAHA'I WORLD                     433

  were able to attend. Green Acre is more expensive than the other two schools and more remote. However, thirteen of the young people held an impromptu meeting for consultation, adopting a firm resolution to sponsor a program in 1936. 

 America is not the only country to have established 

Baha'i Summer Schools.    

 Previous  mention has been made of the Summer School arranged by the 

London Youth Group. An    

 account has also been received of the (CS Wk" in Esslingen, Germany, from which the following extracts are taken. It must be remembered, however, that as Helen Bishop has written, (CJ~ Gernnny the law prohibits or does nor permit  any youth organizations because they have an elaborate political organization in which youth is practically compelled to participate." 

     Dr. Herrnann Grossrnann   

 prepared this report, which has been translated from his German. "There is no youth work of the Baha'is in Germany and Austria at this time. The young Baha'is attend the common Baha meetings. The yearly Baha'i Summer School in Esslingen (on the Neckar River) takes place in the Esslingen Baha'i Home. This summer school has been created by the young generation to represent a center of systematic study of the Teachings  and for social contact. 

 (CThe first summer-school week in Ess-lingen  took place from August 13 to August  21, 1932. The fourth Baha'i Summer-week held from August 24 to September  1, 1935, dealt with these themes: tMankind in the New Era' and Baha'u'llah's  Message.' 

 ttAll the meetings mentioned are in the form of social work-gatherings. A constantly growing number of attendants of all ages is registered. 

 The young Baha'is also attend these meetings with sincere interest. 

 The age mostly represented in speakers and participants, as well as that of most of the volunteers in kitchen-work, is the age between twenty-five and forty years. 

 "Concluding the summer school session there was a Fall meeting in Esslingen on October 6, 1934. This meeting was especially devoted to the Babi'i youth." 

  SOME OTHER ACTIVITIES     

  A major problem confronting any international  movement is that of communication and the young Baha'is have doubtless been impeded in their program by it. However,  various means are now in existeflee which, except for the language barriers, show good promise. 

 Bertram Dewing has for three years edited a Youth Section in the Herald of the South. If Assemblies subscribed more widely to this magazine it could become a most valuable medium. 

 The Baha'i News has published frequent articles and news of the Youth Committee, and during 19343 5, no issue passed without  some mention of youth activity. 

    The National Youth Committee

 has itself  issued an occasional bulletin, and in its third issue has adopted a new format and name. Henceforth it is hoped that Baha'i Youth, An International Bulletin, will appear  quarterly, carrying to youth in all parts of the world news and help from their contemporaries. 

 Finally, with the help of Victoria Be-dikian, a worldwide interchange of correspondence  has begun. 

 One project yet remains to be noted which carries more significance than almost any other; its success will ensure the continuity  of our whole program. In July, 1934, the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada asked all local Assemblies to encourage young people from sixteen to twenty-one years of age to declare "their interest in the Cause and their intention to become voting members. 

 •." To these youth was accorded the privilege of attending Nineteen 

Day Feasts. The Youth     

 Committee studied this matter  and in its second Bulletin suggested a study outline by the use of which young people might acquire a sufficient knowledge of the Faith to determine their own interest.  Undoubtedly a campaign must be entered upon to enroll the children of Baha'is  and all those who manifest a sincere conviction. 

 Each youth group, by its very nature, has a special obligation in this regard  and a special opportunity to prepare its younger members for this prime, essential  step.

434             THE BAHA'I WORLD

      FOR THE FUTURE             

  Baha'i youth, three years ago, stood at the threshold of service to their Faith. 

 There were individuals among them who had participated fully in the community tasks; sporadic attempts at organization had occurred; but no unity of consciousness, no group dedication of will, no "international body of active young Baha'i men and women" had been envisioned or achieved. In the light of these facts, the story of progress since 1933 is no slight one; it represents the initial steps, maneuvered at the bidding of the Guardian, with the steady support of the National Spiritual Assembly, of a movement which today has won security  on a solid basis of philosophy and accomplishment. 

 Today the promise is all ahead. Today the New World Order exists in the minds of youth, not dimly, not as a fantastic hope, but in a real form which is vivid, sure, and ours to be demonstrated. That mankind will demonstrate it upon the field of civilization  none of us doubts. That young Baha'is shall lead the way is our utmost desire. But oniy the grace of Baha'u'llah can bestow such a priceless favor, and only our lives, when surrendered to the purpose  of the Guardian, will render us worthy of His trust. 
                           
                BAHA'I YOUTH IN IRAN

               B~ MARDiYYIH CARPENTER

  UNTIL the summer of 1935, when the Government ordered women of IrAn to unveil and appear in public, the term "youth group" as applied to Baha'i activities in tr~n referred to separate groups composed of young men and women respectively. 

 For centuries the veil has made of fr4n virtually two separate nations; hampered by its restrictions, women of Iran were unable fully to cooperate with the men in directing Baha'i activities; at present it is obvious that after gradual adjustment to the new way of living, young Baha'i women will in cooperation with the men play a still more significant r6le in establishing a new Baha'i civilization throughout tr~n. 

 An investigation of the Tihrin Youth Group will serve to illustrate the activities of young Babi'is of inn as a whole. This group has an enrollment of several hundred members, who among other duties direct a library and maintain a number of classes in public speaking, Baha'i history and principles; they engage in athletics, their teams competing with others throughout the city. They write and produce enthusiastically attended plays illustrative of 

Baha'i principles.  Visitors

 to IrAn Long remember the work of the two Service Committees, composed largely of young men and women whose function it is to prepare general meetings,  receptions, feasts and the like; at a few hours' notice they can transform an auditorium into a palace hung with rugs, bright with candelabra, and serve several hundred guests a perfectly appointed banquet — their ability in this adequately emphasizing that cardinal Irinian principle of hospitality. 

 Regarding teaching activities carried on by these young people, a number of factors illustrative of the difficulties they meet and overcome along this line are worthy of note. Presentday Muslims have as a rule been brought up to disregard the Baha'is, for adverse propaganda has been so strong that it has effectively throttled any effort a Muslim might make toward impartial investigation  of this Cause. A Muslim hearing of some achievement on the part of a Baha'i is apt to say, "How can such a man be d Baha'i"; which is similar to the American's  commenting on a Negro's achievement, "But he has white blood!" 

 or to the European's saying of an American achievement, "But his ancestors were European!" Those who remember the hate engendered by propagandists in the last war, a hate which made impartial thinking criminal, will understand this phase of the present situation in frAn. The average modern Muslim is incidentally not interested in religion; from Europe he has imported cynicism,  along with champagne and the rhumba; of religion he retains oniy the dregs of


<p435>
YOUTH ACTiVITIES THROUGHOUT THE BAHA'I WORLD                     435

  faith: fanaticism. Other difficulties besetting the young Baha'i teacher are the fact that the Cause is revealed partly in Arabic, virtually a foreign language to Irinians; that many tr~nians are illiterate; that the Government has forbidden the entry of Baha'i books into IrAn, so that such facilities as a public reading room with a wealth of available literature, are unachievable; that transportational difficulties widen the distances, and living conditions curtail leisure; that so recently as the winter of 1934, Baha'is were compelled by the authorities to pledge that they would hold no meetings. Obviously teaching the Cause in I r~n is not so simple as in such a country as the United States, where one has oniy to reach for an Esslemont, place it in the inquirer's hands and send him away, happy in the knowledge that he will now make a Baha'i of himself. 

 With reference to educational facilities for Baha'i youth of Ir4n, as it is known the Government closed all Baha'i schools in the country during the winter of 193435. 

 The curriculum in these was uniformly that laid down by the Ministry of Education; it is probably accurate that French influence, stressing theory rather than practice, predominated  in the system adopted; subjects were secular, and a large percentage of the students were often nonBahA'i. 

 The officially  recognized superiority of these schools consisted in their discipline and idealism, as well as in their academic equipment. Supplementary to the secular education received  in the schools, Baha'i youth attend weekly classes in character training — the wellknown tcDars~i~Akhkq)~ course of study composed of teachings of the various Manifestations — and later take up the intensive study of such works as the Iqan and Some Answered Questions. These classes meet at the homes of parents at different points throughout the city and are frequently visited by members of the Spiritual  Assembly and others; opportunities are given the students to speak in general meetings and yearly examinations are Ctpub1ic1y~~ held at which prizes are distributed. 

 Committees  composed of young men and women respectively, direct instruction in all these classes. The summer school which is proving  so effective a means of teaching the Cause throughout the West has not yet been introduced into ir~n, partly no doubt for transportational and climatic reasons. A day's excursion into the country or a short trip to welcome or bid goodby to some visitor, in the course of which meetings  may be held, are perhaps the nearest parallel to the summer schools of the West. It is probable that with the increasing motorization  of Iir~n the summer school will be established here. 

 It would seem, incidentally, that the youth of fr&n are not especially "youth —  conscious." 

 Age in the East has always been confused with wisdom, and a successful  youth is one who gives an impression of age. ~ you become old" is a phrase sometimes used in expressing thanks.) 

 Moreover, there is perhaps no Youth Group in tr&n similar to that in the 'West, where a college career prolongs adolescence; for example, Iran has as yet no university for women, and for them as a rule marriage and the cares of family life immediately follow the secondary education,  On the other hand, the young men are very frequently educated abroad, and the years of separation from their elders tend to obliterate any feeling of differentiation based on age. 

     Regarding the Guardian's   

 injunction to build up an "international body of active young Baha'i men and women," it would seem that a first step in accomplishing this with reference to Inn would be to establish  regular correspondence with various members of the youth group of IrAn. It might not be amiss to exchange questionnaires (always bearing in mind that the Eastern method of collecting information is to "by indirections find directions out"). Obviously, in future a considerable amount of traveling will be necessary to enable Baha'is  in different countries to meet face to face and discuss their work around conference tables; to lay the foundations of such meetings and to dispatch their preliminaries by means of regular correspondence would seem advisable at present. The personal contact established through letters is indispensable in this connection; mere textbook information on the countries to be represented at such conferences would prove insufficient.

 STORY OF THE PAGEANT,  

                 "THE GATE OF DAWN"

  (Arranged by Mrs. Harold Bowditch with suggestions by Mr. Kenneth Christian and presented with the assistance of a large committee in Green Acre, Maine, in the summer of 1934.) 

                  B~ NANCY BOWDITCH

  'IPHE summer of 1934 marked the beginning  of a new activity among the Ba-hi'is of the United States and Canada. A new group called crThe Green Acre Committee  for Plays and Pageants" was formed whose purpose was to develop a means of presenting the Baha'i Teachings through some form of dramatics, particularly in representing scenes from the early history of the Faith. 

 This undertaking was the outcome of the enthusiasm raised in the hearts of some of the devoted believers in the Revelation who were assisted by a number of generous and interested friends who, though in some cases not listed among the ranks of the believers, lent most valuable assistance. After consultation it was decided that to present a series of tableaux would be the most practical, as well as the most dignified way to begin the work, and the Green Acre Summer School in Eliot, Maine, was selected as the best place. Through the generosity of the National Spiritual Assembly, the studio of Mrs. Mary Lucas was secured for the work. 

 Mrs. Lucas was one of the first women pilgrims to visit cAbdu~1~Bahi in the "Most Great Prison" in CAkki, Palestine, and thus her home was converted into a busy workshop where members of the Summer School as well as the Committee worked together in arranging for the pageant and tableaux. 

 In the beginning the Committee felt great responsibility in undertaking a work that presented such possibilities, but they dedicated  their services with love for the uni — versal principles of World Unity and human fellowship which the Faith of Baha'u'llah reveals, so after the reading of prayer and of the sacred writings of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-BaM they embarked upon this important  enterprise. 

 Great credit is due to the membership of the Committee as well as to Mr. Randolph Bolles, Mr. Sutherland Maxwell, Dr. Ambrose of Washington, D. C., Mrs. E. N. Jones (who though not a declared Baha'i made a special trip from "Washington in order to assist), and to Mr. Max Miller who trained the choruses and who wrote a special song called "The Valley of Search" especially for the occasion. 

 An interesting lecture given at Green Acre by Ali-Kuli Khan on the significance of colors in the art of Inn proved the inspiration  upon which the costumes for the ccAttributes~~ and others were designed. 

 This first effort resulted in the presentation  of tableaux from ttThe Dawn-Break-ers with prologue and epilogue of pageantry and music and reading of the Holy 

Words.                     

 The following is a brief description of the way in which the tableaux were presented.  A small stage was erected at the end of the auditorium in the Inn. Across the proscenium arch were stretched two layers of gauze netting which were attached  to a square framework. This frame was lighted at the top, bottom and sides and created the illusion of a large painting. Color filters were made by stretching colored  paper over a light framework of wood. These were in sets of different colors so 436

 that the general lighting of the stage could represent early morning or noon or sunset as required, and were changed for each scene. 

 In front of the center of the stage a small dais was placed which was cctop~ lighted" by a ttspot" suspended in the beams of the room. After the audience was assembled  all the lights in the hail were extinguished  with the exception of this "spot-light," then the soft strains of violin and piano were heard. At this point there came slowly from the back of the auditorium two angels, one a small girl with white wings, dressed in soft pink draperies and carrying in her hand a three-branched lighted candle. Behind her came the angel Gabriel clad entirely in white with wings, holding in his hands a large illuminated book. 

 A few paces behind the angel came a poet of I ran. When they reached the dais the angel stepped upon it, having the poet on one hand and the small angel on the other. 

 Leaning forward the Angel Gabriel held out the book to the poet (the music muted so that the speaking voices became clearly audible) , at the same time repeating these verses from the 

C(Hidd Words" of Baha'u'llah: 

 CCThis is that which bath descended from the realm of glory, uttered by the tongue of power and might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old. We have taken the inner essence thereof and clothed it in the garment  of brevity as a token of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto the Covenant of God, may fulfil in their lives His trust, and in the realm of spirit obtain the gem of Divine Virtue." 

 The poet, raising his face to Gabriel, held out his hands for the book saying: CC~ God! my God! Thy call has attracted  me and the Voice of Thy Pen of Glory has awakened me; the stream of Thy Holy Utterances has enraptured me, and the 'Wine of Thy Inspiration entranced me. 

 ~CThou seest me, 0 Lord, detached from all things but Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy Bounty and craving the wonders of Thy Grace Then taking the book from the Angel Gabriel he repeats: my God, strengthen my hands to take Thy Book with such steadfastness that the hosts of the world shall not prevent them. Then protect them, 0 my Lord, from disposing of anything not owned by them. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the 

Mighty!"                   

 Then the Angel speaks: (cThe Sun of Truth is the Word of God upon which depends the training of the people of the country of thought. It is the Spirit of Reality and the Water of Life. All things owe their existence to It. Its manifestation is ever according to the capacity  and coloring of the mirror through which it may reflect. For example, Its Light, when cast on the mirrors of the wise, gives expression to wisdom; when reflected from the minds of artists It produces manifestations  of new and beautiful arts; when It shines through the minds of students It reveals knowledge and unfolds mysteries. 

 All the good names and lofty qualities are of the 'Word      This is the Water which giveth life to all things. 

 The poet answers: CCWe beg of God that we may partake of this Life-Giving Water of Heaven, and quaff from the spiritual chalice of rest, and thus be free from all that tends to withhold us from approaching 

His Love.                  

 c(Glory be upon the people of Glory!" 

 Now the music becomes louder, the two angels continue siowiy through the hail and exit. The poet withdraws to one side of the stage and places his book on the reading stand. Meantime a procession of some of the (cAttributes~~ of God — Sovereignty, Loftiness, Love, Glory, Death and Life — form at the back of the hail and move slowly forward,  each very far apart, so that only one at a time is in view of the audience. 

 Love enters garbed in long robes of pink and rose colors, carrying in her arms a spray of roses. She mounts the dais and, turning toward the audience repeats from the ttHid-den  Words" —  CCO Friend! In the garden of the heart plant naught but the rose of love, and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold. Treasure the companionship  of the righteous and eschew all fellowship  of the ungodly." 

(CO Son of Love! Thou      
art but one step


<p439>
PLAYS AND PAGEANTS                439

  away from the glorious heights above and from the celestrial tree of love. Take thou one pace, and with the next advance into the immortal realm and enter the pavilion of eternity. Give ear then to that which hath been revealed by the Pen of 

Glory!"                    

 After Love has left the room, each of the others in turn, on reaching the dais, step up, and facing the audience, recite further from the !tHidden Words." 

 When the "AtCbt" have made their exit, the poet opens his book and begins to read: ttQ my friends! I shall your ears delight with the wondrous tale of the Day wherein you live. 

 History, in destiny's wind again is stirred, once more the clarion of dawn comes to rejoice the hearts of men; two stars first caught its Lighv; — an aged man, a Shaykh of 'Arabi, arose and called men to prepare for the advent of that Promised One Whose Name for a thousand years they had invoked. 

 King and peasant of Inn did he stir and at length, nearing his journey's end, he passed on the leader's torch to Siyyid Kizim. 

 In these words he bade him carry on: tYou have no time to lose. 

 Every fleeting  hour should be fully and wisely utilized. You should gird up the loins of endeavor and strive day and night to rend asunder, by the Grace of God, and by the hand of wisdom and lovingkindness, those veils of heedlessness that have blinded the eyes of men. For verily I say, the Hour is drawing nigh, the Hour I have besought God to spare me from witnessing, for the earthquake  of the Last Hour will be tremendous! 

 C(YOU should pray to God to be spared the overpowering trials of that Day, for neither of us is capable of withstanding its sweeping force! Others of greater endurance and power have been destined to bear this stupendous weight; men whose hearts are sanctified from all earthly things, and whose strength is re~nforced by the potency of His Power!" 
(Nabil's Narrative, page 16.)

 At the closing of this reading of the poet the curtains of the stage are parted disclosing a living picture of Shaykh A12m~id-i-AhsA'i  seated cross-legged on the floor with his pupil, Siyyid Kizim near him, attentively tentively receiving his instructions. The curtains are lowered and then drawn aside again, to show the picture twice. 

 'When the curtains are lowered the last time the poet begins to read from the book the rest of the story which is here given briefly —  He tells how the fire of Belief and Faith spread rapidly throughout the dark land of Iran and how a New Dawn is spreading its light over all the country. One day when Siyyid KA?im was teaching his pupils beneath  the shade of a palm tree there appeared to him a shepherd who came to tell of a dream that he had had. He dreamed that he saw the Prophet Muhammad who told him that he would find the Siyyid in the vicinity of the mosque in the shade of this tree, and that he was to give him the following message: "Rejoice, for the hour of your departure  is at hand. When you shall have performed  your visits in K6zimayn and shall have returned to Karbik, there, three days after your return, on the day of tArafih, you will wing your flight to Me. Soon after shall He, Who is the Truth, be made manifest. 

 Then shall the world be illuminated  by the light of His Face~" (Na —  bil's Narrative, page 44.) 

 Again the curtains are drawn aside and a scene of the shepherd kneeling before Siy-yid  Kizim is ~how~. 

 Th~ poet reads on. He reads of the death of Siyyid Kizim and how one remained of his disciples, a youth, one Mulh I~Iusayn, who was mindful of his teacher's words. He had told him to detach himself from earthly things and to seek with determination and prayer his true Guide and Master. 

 Mulli ~usayn traveled from city to city until finally, on the outskirts of the city of Shiriz he met a radiant Youth Who took him home and entertained him. There he sat all night enraptured by the words of his Host, in a room filled with fragrant blossoms, whilst fruits and delicious drink were served to him by an Ethiopian servant. He was made so happy that he put his feelings  into these words: ctMethinks I was in, a place of which it can be truly ~ no toil shall reach us, and therein no weariness shall touch us; no vain discourse shall they hear


<p440>
440             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  therein, nor any falsehood, but oniy the cry, — "Peace! 

 Peace!" ' Then his Host addressed him saying: ~     thou who art first to believe in Me! Verily, I say, I am the Bab — the Gate of God, and thou art the BTh'u'1-Bib, the Gate of the Gate. 

 Eighteen souis must, in the beginning, spontaneously and of their own accord, accept Me and recognize the Truth of My Revelation. 

 Unwarned and uninvited, each of these must seek independently to find 

Me.'"                      

 From this state of ecstasy Mulli ~usayn was awakened by the voice of the priest calling the people to early morning prayer. 

 (At this point appears a tableau of Mulli Husayn showing the fruit being offered  to him by the servant. A pink light is diffused over the scene and vases of flowers are set on the floor in different places.) 

 The next scene is the public punishment of Quddfis and Mulli S6~diq, the two first victims of the enemies of the New Revela-non. 

 Mulli Sidiq says of this punishment: ttThe first seven strokes were severely painful, to the rest I seemed to have grown indifferent. 

 I was wondering whether the strokes that followed were being actually applied to my own body. A feeling of joy —  ous exaltation had invaded my soui. 

 I was trying to repress my feelings and to restrain my laughter. I can now realize how the Almighty Deliverer is able, in the twinkling of an eye, to turn pain into ease and sorrow into gladness (Nabil's Narrative,  page 148.) 

 The next picture is that of TThirih, that great woman disciple, casting off her veil in the presence of Quddtis, the famed BThi, defender of the Faith. This took place at the conference of Badaslit. 

 These were her words in part: CCThis is the Day of festivity and universal  rejoicing, the Day on which the fetters of the past are burst asunder! Let those who have shared in this great achievement arise and embrace each other!" 

 The next picture represents that scene in the Caravanserai where three hundred youths had banded together in defense of their Faith, led by MuM Husayn. When it became time for evening prayer volunteers were called for to ascend and give the call to prayer. 

 The first youth who ascended to the roof had no sooner proclaimed the opening ~~God is the Most Great" when a bullet from the enemy shot him down. 

 Immediately  a second youth ascended, taking tip the prayer where the first left off, only to be stricken down as his predecessor. In this way the prayer was continued until the end, each youth cheerfully offering himself in the place of the one gone before.  When the curtain is lifted upon this scene the third youth is revealed continuing the prayer with the first two lying dead at his feet. 

 These six scenes will serve to show how the tableaux were presented. 

 A brief outline  of the rest follows: Scene seven represents the little Sifter of Wheat, who, hurrying away from the mar-ket-place  with his sieve in his hand, answered  those who called after him inquiring where he was going so hurriedly, "I have arisen to join the glorious company of the Defenders of the 

Shaykh-Tabarsi." Out       

 of that great city of I~f~h~n only one person went forth to find the Light of the New Day — a humble sifter of wheat! 

 Scene eight represents the farewell of Quddds and Mulli Husayn. This event occurred  just before one of the great defenses of Fort Tabarsi when they had been holding the army of the Shih at bay for eleven months. 

 Scene nine shows Mirza QurMn~cA1i bending over, pleading with the executioner, while his arms are about the body of the first glorious martyr who was the uncle of the Bib. His words were: ccAproach and strike your blow, for my faithful companion  is unwilling to release himself from my embrace and calls me to hasten together with him to the court of the 

Well-Beloved!"             

 Scene ten shows the valiant girl soldier, Zaynab, who, not being able to witness the sufferings of her companions in the fortress of Zanj An, begged to be allowed to have a sword and dress in men's clothing. This brave 'tJeanne d'Arc" is shown mounting the battlements sword in hand. 

 Scene eleven shows the bride and groom who were married during one of the great

 summons the bridegroom to the defense  of the Faith. 'While a soldier is leading  the bridegroom away a friend of the bride is trying to console her. 

 Scene twelve shows Thhirih, arrayed in purest white, handing a green kerchief to the boy who has escorted her, in order that he may hand it to the executioner who is to strangle her. 

 The last scene shows the "Attributes of God" reentering the hail and forming themselves in two groups, one on each side of the stage. 

 The curtains part disclosing an angel with great white wings who recites the farewell message of the Glorious Bab to His disciples which begins: cco my beloved friends! 

 You are the bearers of the Name of God in this Day! You have been chosen as the repositories of His mystery. It behooves each one of you to manifest the attributes of God and to exemplify by your deeds and words the signs of His righteousness, His power and glory. The very members of your body must bear witness to the loftiness of your purpose, the integrity of your life, the reality  of your faith, and the exalted character  of your devotion (Nabil's Narrative, page 92.) 

 'With these closing words the Attributes of God begin softly to chant the Greatest Name.' Then, as they form in procession the chant becomes gradually louder as the entire cast joins in and passing through the room in single file the whole audience rises and intones the chant in glorious crescendo.

              THE DRAMA OF THE KINGDOM

  AMONG the all-too-rare dramatic adaptations of the episodes and teachings contained  in the early history of the Baha'i Faith there appears from the pen of t~Par-vine"  (Mrs. 

Basil Hall of London)      

 an exquisite  and faithful dramatization under the title of ~tThe Drama of the Kingdom" which took form in consequence of a Talk given in the home of her mother, Lady Blomfield, by tAbdu'1-Bahi. 

 Mrs. Hall relates the history of the occurrence in the following  manner and uses the story as a Foreword to the Drama itself. She says: It was during CAbd~1Bh~~ visit to London in 1913, that he said to one whom he called ~tHh" (Neighbor) "I will give you a play. 

 It shall be called "The Drama of the Kingdom." 

 The circle of friends, who were gathered round him that evening, held a tense silence, while, in his deep, sonorous voice, !Abdu~1~ Baha unfolded the pageant of his sublime imagination thus: 1 "The Herald of the Kingdom stands before  the people. 

 Wonderful music swells from an unseen orchestra, moving and soul1 1 The above are the words of Abdu'l-Baha Abbas, translated by an interpreter and taken down by Parvine as they were spoken. 

 inspiring. The music becomes soft, while the Herald proclaims the coining of the Kingdom. He holds a trumpet to his mouth. 

 t~The curtain rises. The stage is crowded with men and women. All are asleep. At the sound of the trumpet they begin to awake. 

 "Suddenly the music breaks forth. The people hear and wonder. They rise and question one another, saying, cWhat is this? Whence comes this music?' Some return to their occupations, unheeding. First a few talk together, then one ceases his work, and proceeds to make inquiries. A merchant, leaving his stall, comes to ask the meaning of the eager group. 

 A soldier, Who is practising arms, withdraws from his comrades and joins those who are wondering. 

 (cHere a banker is seen counting his money; his attention is attracted. 

 He pauses in his calculation, and asks, ~What is the news?' 

 "There are seen dancers and others holding  revelry. 

 Some of them come forth and ask the news, questioning the Herald. 

 "Now those who come to ask are more or less divided into the following groups. First those who, having heard of the Corn

 (CT1~e blind receive their sight, the deaf their hearing, and those who were dead arise and walk, still wrapped in the garments of death. 

 ~Then there are those who will not believe until they have had signs revealed to them, who crave for proof, saying: tBut we want to see the earthquake. If the Promised One is indeed come, the sun should not give his light, the moon should be darkened,  and the stars should fall. We await our Promised One till these signs be fulfilled. 

 We expect to see him descend from heaven in clouds of great glory.' 

 "Those who believe shout, cihe Promised One has come!' 

 ~tThose who doubt cry, CWhat proof is there? 
Show us a proof!'          

 "They who understand explain: tWhence did Christ come? 

 He came from heaven, though they who scoffed at Him said, awe know this man, he comes from Nazareth." This is the real meaning: His spirit caine from heaven, while His body was born of an earthly mother. As it was then, so is it with the Second 

Coming.'                   

 CC cBut we await the signs,' say the doubting  ones. 

 CHow, otherwise, shall we know? The earth must shake, the mountains be rent asunder. The Promised One shall conquer  the East and the West.' 

 CCOne arises and tells the people that these signs did not come outwardly, nor will they again. Those who look with the eyes of Truth shall see that these portents are of the Spirit. 

     "The Eternal Sovereignty   

 descends from heaven, the body is of the earth. 

 The mountains are men of high renown, whose famous names sink into insignificance, when the dawn of the Manifestation fills the world with light. 

 The pomp of Annas and Caiaphas is outshone by the simple glory of the Christ. The earthquake is the wave of spiritual life, that moves through all living things and makes creation quiver. 
     CeThe prophecies of the    

Coming of Christ           

 were mystical. The prophecies concerning the Second Coming are also mystical. 

 The earthquakes and unrest, the darkening of the sun and moon, the falling of the stars —  all these foretell the humiliation of those whom the world considers great. Theologians wrapped in blind traditions, the bigots and the hypocrites: such will fall. 

 "Now these sayings will be divided between  different people, altogether forming a conversation, questions, answers, exclamations of wonder, and so forth. 
   ttNow a procession passes. 
The Pageant of the World.  

 Grand nobles and kings, high priests and dignitaries of the Churches, jewelled and gorgeously dressed. 

 They look with scorn on those who believe, saying, (WWhy should we leave our ancient religions?' They look like devils of malice and oppression.  Yet each is miserable. One falls, the others pass on. One is dying, the others take no heed. Another breathes his last. They do not stop by the way. 

 rcThe poor who have believed look on sadly. 

 t~The scene changes. A banquet hail. The table is spread with all delicious foods. The orchestra is playing heavenly music. The lights become gradually more brilliant, until the whole hail is shining. 

 Round the table sit the very poor in torn garments. An Oracle arises and cries: tThe Kingcjorn of God is like a feast! Remember what Christ said! Here we see the Kingdom! The greatest and the worldly wise are not here, but the poor are here!' 

 ccEach sings from the joy of his heart, and there is great rejoicing. Some dance, one plays the flute, everyone is radiantly happy. Someone addresses the people. While this man is speaking they say: CHear him! Hear his eloquence! 

 We know him. He was poor and ignorant, and now he is wise!' And so they wonder and question one another.  A woman rises and speaks, laughing and happy. The people are surprised, saying: CBut what has happened? 

 Yesterday  this woman was sad, and angry. Her heart was full of sorrow and disappointment.  Why is she so joyous?'

 "Then a teacher comes and speaks on a high plane of philosophy and science.

  "After this song, glorious diadems descend  from Heaven and rest on each head. They shine with the radiance of Heavenly jewels. 
All wonder and ask questions.

 One arises and says: tThese are the crowns of the Kingdom! 
Ye are all Heavenly rulers!

 Ye shall have eternal dominion! Ye shall have everlasting glory! The illumination of the Spirit is yours. God hath chosen you for His service!' 

 They take their crowns and kiss them, and again place them on their heads. 

 "Then they begin to pray and supplicate:

         PAGEANTRY AS A FACTOR IN EDUCATION
                   B~ CLARA WIBIR

  '"T4HE idea of the pageant, which I here describe, gradually evolved during my travels  through Egypt, Palestine, and Syria when I had exceptional opportunities to make interesting contacts, and later, when I joined the International Students Union while I was associated with the Baha'i Bureau in Geneva, Switzerland. 

 I was so deeply impressed by my experiences that I decided upon my return to the schoolroom to convey to my pupils my deep conviction of the essential oneness of humanity.  It was then that I chose the pageant as a means of giving a message. 

 An educator said to me after hearing of this pageant, ttA pageant to be of value must grow out of the heart of the author, and the need of the times." I had a message to give and I felt that the need for it had arisen. 

 It was begun as a simple program  presented in observance of Interna —  tional Goodwill Day, before a Junior High School audience, but has since been given for adults to whom it appealed as much as to the youth, which proves that the realm of the heart is t~ever~young.~~ The history of pageantry is an interesting one. 

 It sprang from pantomime, the first means of communication, and became the mother of drama. Primitive man probably found in pageantry, crude as it might be, a vehicle for the education of the youth of his time. 

 ceThe modern pageant is the direct outgrowth of the mystery play of the later middle ages," writes Linwood Taft in his book on pageantry. 

 "The mystery play concerned itself with those rare moments of human experience when existence was transformed and glorified through contact with the divine. 

 The sort of event that makes suitable and convincing pageant material,  is the unusual event, the kind of thing that happens only in exalted moments when men are inspired by lofty and unselfish  motives."1 We called our presentation 

CCA Pageant of Nations."   

 A spectator might have described  it as follows: A prologue consisting of a dialogue between an old sea-captain and his grandson prepared the audience for the pageant that followed. The Captain relates his experiences in foreign lands, dwelling upon the similarities of people as a factor for unification, and upon their differences as a means of enhancement; the need of acquiring better understanding so that prejudice may not enter and, also, of cultivating  not only the international mind but the international heart as well. 

 The notes of a flute furnish the signal for 

     'The Technique of Pageantry

<p446>
446             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the opening of the pageant, the sea-captain and boy remaining at the left of the stage as spectators. 

 The opening of the curtain reveals the Spirit of Progress with outstretched  arms before the altar of civilization. 

 The altar is placed before a stone wall above which appear the dome and minarets of a mosque, the tower of a Christian church, and the top of a synagogue, with shrubbery and palm trees, the scene typical of an eastern Mediterranean port. The orchestra  is playing an oriental melody, 

C(J~ a Persian Market."    

 The Spirit of Progress turns and takes her place t~down right." There she tells the story of civilization as each nation, race, or religion places its contribution  upon the altar. 

 Part I contains nineteen episodes, beginning  with the contributions of the Egyptians  and Babylonians to science, and of the Hebrews to religious literature. Since the main thread of continuity is furnished by the theme of the "oneness of humanity" the episodes are strung upon this theme, with equality as the unifying idea. 

The Spirit of Progress     

 shows that many great religious leaders have arisen from time to time, presenting as the highlight of Part I the contribution of Palestine with its gift of the Prince of Peace, — this scene presented by a girl who recites some of the Beatitudes, using as a climax, "Blessed are the peacemakers  for they shall be called the children of God," — followed by the contribution of Rome in the spread of Christianity; of the Crusades as a factor in the greater unification of mankind; of the gifted and heroic Joan of Arc; and of Lafayette, who cemented  the friendship between Erance and America; of Scotland and Robert Burns, the poet of brotherhood, who enters to the tune ~f ~ Lang Sync," and reads the lines, For a' that and a' that It's comm' yet for a' that, That man to man, the world o'er Shall brothers be for a' that. 

  And the curtain closes upon Part I with the joyous dancing of an Irish jig. 

 Then followed a short interlude called "A Pledge of Friendship" in which Columbia,  as hostess, welcomes Canada, Mexico and the South American Republics. 

 This is to demonstrate that if friendship is possible among these closely associated and related nations, then friendship is also possible among all nations. It was a brief, yet colorful  and convincing scene. 

        The Spirit of Progress     

 then introduced Part H, before the curtain. A rnu'adhdhin's call is heard in the distance. 

 Upon the opening of the curtain, he gives the call again, and then the Muhammadans are seen passing to the mosque. At the ringing of the church bells a priest and his flock are shown on their way to mass; later, a rabbi and his followers pass to worship — this to show that there is a place for every religion in the scheme of things. 

 A typical oriental street scene is then enacted. 

 Arabs, Jews, Hindus, trinians, American and English tourists, 

Chinese, and American      

 sailors, present  a colorful panorama. Native women carrying water jugs and baskets, boys bearing  huge trays of bread on their heads, and a man leading a white donkey suggest consistently the picturesqueness of such a scene. In the meantime the sea-captain has again resumed the dialogue with the boy, explaining  some of the customs in Eastern cities. 

 The pageant proper was then resumed with the contribution of the Arabs. 

 Part II (in eleven episodes) has a number of very dramatic moments such as the unveiling of Tihirih, the noted woman martyr of I r~n, emancipator of women of Pin; the gift of Spain in the discovery of America, the Spirit of Progress reading these lines of 

Jo'aquin Miller:           

  He gained a world; He gave that world its grandest lesson: CCQ~ and on." And then to the tune of "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," occurs the dramatic entrance of the framers of the Constitution; and while the music continues faintly, a colored boy struggles "center stage" with his hands tied. After several futile attempts to free himself, the tall, familiar figure of Abraham Lincoln enters and seeing the slave's anguish releases the bonds. The con —  tributions of the negro race then follow. One of these is the spirit of reverence as it reveals, itself in his beautiful spirituals, sung by a negro quartet. 
This scene is followed


<p447>
PLAYS AND PAGEANTS                447

  by the contribution of the American Indian, climaxed by the entrance of an Indian chief who lays his pipe of peace upon the altar as a symbol of brotherhood. Part II ends with the gift of Switzerland: the city of Geneva, the home of the League of Nations. 

     The Spirit of Progress    
then resumes her recital. 

 She says, in brief, that the most important contributions have been made to civilization during the past eighty years, improvements in the means of transportation and communication drawing the ends of the world together. When Morse flashed those dramatic words through space in 1844, a new era was begun, and that, CC America has been the leader in furnishing the means for the unification of mankind. but that it is selfevident that unity and conciliation of the human world cannot be accomplished through material means alone. To establish these principles a propelling power is needed which will bring about a change in the hearts of all men. Unity is possible among individuals; it is also possible among nations." 2 aWhcn God created the earth there were no restricted boundaries. He did not apportion a certain area to Germany,  or to France, or to England, but He apportioned the whole earth to humanity. Then let us strive again to bring about such a condition so that when one is asked, tlo which nationality do you belong?' the answer will be, tlo the nationality of humanity.'  In other words, we shall be one family, one country, one wodd of humanity; and these wars, hatreds and strifes will pass ,, S away. 

 The last scene shows the uniting of the nations. All participants are gathered on the stage at the rise of the curtain. 

 In the center stands a slender white pole surmounted by a white dove, with wings outspread,  and bearing in its bill an olive branch. Colored streamers suspended from the pole are held by some of the representa —  tives of the nations and races who form two circles about the pole. At the right stands TThirih, the lady of Pin, who is saying to them: ~~In a flower garden, the very fact that there is difference and variety lends a 

       2 ~Abdu'I — Bah~, Promulgation

 of Universal Peace (1925), 1, 9. 
~Ibid., I, 114.           

 charm to the garden. If all were of the same color the effect would be monotonous and depressing. The world of humanity is like a garden, and the various races are the flowers which constitute its adornment.  ~ Here the orchestra plays a beautiful strain and the Spirit of Peace enters dancing joyously from one nation to another,  joining the hand of each with the hand of its neighbor. Then the Spirit of Progress pronounces the following words: ccMe thinks in the stillness of the ecstasy of this hour I hear wafted to earth, upon the breath of peace, this message: ~Ye are all the leaves of one tree, the drops of one ocean, and the children of one God!' 

 A pageant of this kjnd, planned as a means to an end — a phase in the education of youth — proved a most interesting experiment. 

 When we realize that upon the youth of today rests the responsibility of rescuing the world from chaos, of active participation in the reconstruction of tomorrow,  and the establishment of a new world order, then no effort is wasted, for the soil is fertile, and results are certain. 

 The combined effect of the words of the Spirit of Progress, the music by an orchestra of forty pieces, which supported the theme and added to the emotional appeat and the colorful costumes, made a lasting impression on the youthftd audience; and those in the pageant expressed a joyousness that was refreshing. Each one felt that he had lost his identity in that of a nation, a race, a religion, or a quality. 

 Joan of Arc was the personification of the spirit of Joan of Arc; Abraham Lincoln spoke but one line, ~The white race should be just and kind to the colored race," but that line was imbued with the spirit of Lincoln. 

 The girl who represented the lady of lr~n said to me: "I feel that I am Phirili and that the words she speaks are my words," and of this one could have no doubt. So viVid was her pantomime that when she unveiled her face and walked off the stage with beckoning gesture, one could almost suppiy these words: "0 women of the world, follow in my footsteps — work for the advancement 4lbid., I, 42.

  and kindness, and of his father the great teacher of international goodwill and understanding  — of a religion which Links all creeds. 

 Their writings are a great cry toward peace, reaching beyond all limits of frontiers,  above all dissension about rites and dogmas. It is a religion based upon the inner spirit of God, upon the great, not-to-be-overcome  verity that God is love, meaning just that. It teaches that all hatreds, intrigues, suspicions, evil words, all aggressive patriotism even, are outside the one essential  law of God, and that special beliefs are but surface things whereas the heart that beats with divine love knows no tribe nor race. 

 It is a wondrous Message that Baha'u'llah and his son CAbdu~1~Bah~ have given us. They have not set it up aggressively, knowing  that the germ of eternal truth which lies at its core cannot but take root and spread. 

 There is oniy one great verity in it: Love, the mainspring of every energy, tolerance toward each other, desire of understanding each other, knowing each other, helping each other, forgiving each other. 

     It is Christ's Message     

 taken up anew, in the same words almost, but adapted to the thousand years and more difference that lies between the year one and today. No man could fail to be better because of this Book. 
     I commend it to you all.   

 If ever the name of Baha'u'llah or CAbd 'lBh' comes to your attention, do not put their writings from you. Search out their Books, and let their glorious, peace-bringing, love-creating words and lessons sink into your hearts as they have into mine. 

 One's busy day may seem too full for religion. 

 Or one may have a religion that satisfies. But the teachings of these gentle, wise and kindly men are compatible with all religion, and with no religion. 

 Seek them, and be the happier. 

(From the Toronto Daily    

 Star, May 4, 1926.)     _______ 2. 

 Of course, if you take the stand that creation has no aim, it is easy to dismiss life and death with a shrug and a ttthat ends it all; nothing comes after." 

 But how difficult it is so to dismiss the universe, our world, the animal and vegetable  world, and man. How clearly one sees a plan in everything. 

 Flow unthinkable it is that the miraculous development that has brought man's body, brain and spirit to what it is, should cease. W'hy should it cease? 

 Why is it not logical that it goes on? Not the body, which is oniy an instrument,  but the invisible spark or fire within the body which makes man one with the wider plan of creation. 

 My words  are lame, and why should I grope for meanings when I can quote from one who has said it so much more plainly, Abdu'l-Baha, whom I know would sanction the use of his words: "The whole physical creation is perishable.  Material bodies are composed of atoms. When these atoms begin to separate, decomposition sets in. Then comes what we call death. 

 C tThis composition of atoms which constitutes the body or mortal element of any created being, is temporary. When the power of attraction which holds these atoms together is withdrawn, the body as such ceases to exist. 
   (CWth the soul it is different.

 The soul is not a combination of elements, is not composed of many atoms, is of one indivisible substance and therefore eternal. 

 ttlt is entirely out of the order of physical creation; it is immortal! 

 The soul, being an invisible, indivisible substance, can suffer  neither disintegration nor destruction. Therefore there is no reason for its coming to an end. 

 CC~id the aim of creation: Is it possible  that all is created to evolve and develop  through countless ages with merely this small goal in view — a few years of man's life on earth? Is it not unthinkable that this should be the final aim of existence?  Does a man cease to exist when he leaves his body? 

 If his life comes to an end, then all previous evolution is useless. 
All has been for nothing.  

 All those eons of evolu-don for nothing! Can we imagine that creation had no greater aim than this?


<p452>
452             THE BAHA'I WORLD

 ttThe very existence of n-ian's intelligence proves his immortality. His intelligence is the intermediary between his body and his spirit. When man allows his spirit, through his soui, to enlighten his understanding, then does he contain all creation; because man being the culmination of all that went before, and thus superior to all previous evolutions, contains all the lower already-evolved  world within himself. Illumined by the spirit through the instrumentality of the soul, man's radiant intelligence makes him the crowning-point of creation!" 

 Thus does tAbdu~1~Bah~ explain to us the soul — the most convincing elucidation I know. 

(From the Toronto Daily    
Star, September 28, 1926.) 

  At first we all conceive of God as something  or somebody apart from ourselves. We think He is something or somebody definite, outside of us, whose quality, meaning  and so-to-say tcpersonality~~ we can grasp with our human, finite minds, and express in mere words. 

 This is not so. We cannot, with our earthly faculties entirely grasp His meaning — no more than we can really understand the meaning of Eternity. 

 God is certainly not the old Fatherly gentleman with the long beard that in our childhood we saw pictured sitting amongst clouds on the throne of judgment, holding the lightning of vengeance in His hand. 

 God is something simpler, happier, and yet infinitely more tremendous. God is All, Everything. He is the power behind all beginnings. 

 He is the inexhaustible source of supply, of love, of good, of progress, of achievement. God is therefore Happiness. 

 His is the voice within us that shows us good and evil. 

 But mostly we ignore or misunderstand this voice. 

 Therefore did He choose his Elect to come down amongst us upon earth to make clear His word, His real meaning. Therefore the Prophets; therefore Christ, Muhammad, Baha'u'llah, for man needs from time to time a voice upon earth to bring God to him, to sharpen the realization of the existence of the true God. Those voices sent to us had to become flesh, so that with our earthly ears we should be able to hear and understand. 

 Those who read their Bible with ccpeeled eyes" will find in almost every line some revelation. 

 But it takes long life, suffering or some sudden event to tear all at once the veil from our eyes, so that we can truly see. 

 Sorrow and suffering are the surest and also the most common instructors, the straightest channel to God — that is to say, to that inner something within each of us which is God. 

 Happiness beyond all understanding comes with this revelation that God is within us, if we will but listen to His voice. We need not seek Him in the clouds. 

 He is the All-Father whence we came and to whom we shall return when, having done with this earthly body, we pass onward. 

 If I have repeated myself, forgive me. There are so many ways of saying things, but what is important is the truth which lies in all the many ways of expressing it. (From the Philadelphia r~Evening Bulletin," Monday, September 27, 1926.) 

  ttLately a great hope has come to me from one, Abdu'l-Baha. I have found in His and His Father, 

Baha'u'llah's Message       

 of Faith all my yearning for real religion satisfied. 

 If you ever hear of Baha'is or of the Baha'i Movement which is known in America, you will know what that is. What I mean: these Books have strengthened me beyond belief and I am now ready to die any day full of hope. But I pray God not to take me away yet for I still have a lot of work to do." 

  ttThe Baha'i teaching brings peace and understanding. 

 'CIt is like a wide embrace gathering together  all those who have long searched for words of hope.

  "It accepts all great prophets gone before, it destroys no other creeds and leaves all doors open. 

 ccSaddened by the continual strife amongst believers of many confessions and wearied of their intolerance towards each other, I discovered in the Baha'i teaching the real spirit of Christ so often denied and misunderstood: "Unity instead of strife, hope instead of condemnation, love instead of hate, and a great reassurance for all men." 

  "The Baha'i teaching brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart. 

 ttTo those in search of assurance the words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering." 

  "More than ever today when the world is facing such a crisis of bewilderment and unrest, must we stand firm in Faith seeking that which binds together instead of tearing asunder." 

 "To those searching for light, the Baha'i Teachings offer a star which will lead them to deeper understanding to assurance, peace and good will with all men." 

  B~ PROFESSOR E. G. BROWNE 

Introduction to Myron   

 H. Phelps' eAbbds Effendi, pages xv-xx; 1903 rev. 1912 —  I have often heard wonder expressed by Christian ministers at the extraordinary success  of Bab missionaries, as contrasted with the almost complete failure of their own. ~~How is it," they say, c~tht the Christian doctrine, the highest and the noblest which the world has ever known, though supported  by all the resources of "Western civilization,  can only count its converts in Muhammadan  lands by twos and threes, while Bibiisrn can reckon them by thousands?" The answer, to my mind, is plain as the sun at midday. 'Western Christianity, save in the rarest cases, is more Western than Christian, more racial than religious; and by dallying with doctrines plainly incompatible with the obvious meaning of its Founder's words, such as the theories of Ccii supremacy, "imperial destiny," ccsurviyaL of the fittest," and the iike, grows steadily more rather than iess material. Did Christ belong to a (Cd mj race, or even to a European or C~white race"?     I am not arguing that the Christian religion is true, but merely that it is in manifest conflict with several other theories of life which practically regulate  the conduct of all States and most individuals in the 'Western world, a world which, on the whole, judges all things, including  religions, mainly by material, or to use the more popular term, tcpractica1,~~ 1934.     standards.     There is, of course, another factor in the success of the Bab propagandist, as compared with the Christian missionary, in the conversion of Muhammadans to his faith: namely, that the former admits, while the latter rejects, the Divine in —  spiration of the Qur'an and the prophetic function of Muhammad. The Christian missionary must begin by attacking, explicitly  or by implication, both these beliefs; too often forgetting that if (as happens but rarely) he succeeds in destroying them, he destroys with them that recognition of former prophetic dispensations (including 1936. the Jewish and the Christian) which Mu-bammad  and the Qur'an proclaim, and converts his Muslim antagonist not to Christianity, but to Skepticism or Atheism. What, indeed, could be more illogical on the part of Christian missionaries to Mu-hamnciadan lands than to devote much time and labor to the composition of controversial  works which endeavor to prove, in one and the same breath, first, that the Qur'an is a lying imposture, and, secondly, that it bears witness to the truth of Christ's mission,  as though any value attached to the testimony of one proved a liar! 

The BThi (or Baha'i)    

 propagandist, on the other hand, admits that Muhammad was the prophet of God and that the Qur'an is the Word of God, denies nothing but their

  finality, and does not discredit his own witness when he draws from that source arguments to prove his faith. To the Western observer, however, it is the complete sincerity of the BThis, their fearless disregard  of death and torture undergone for the sake of their religion, their certain conviction as to the truth of their faith, their generally admirable conduct towards mankind  and especially towards their fellow-believers, which constitutes their strongest claim on his attention. 
                           
Introduction to Myron      

 H. Phelps' CAbbds Ejjendi, pages xn-xiv —  It was under the influence of this enthusiasm  that I penned the introduction to my translation of the Traveller's 

Narrative.                 

 This enthusiasm, condoned, if not shared, by many kindly critics and reviewers, exposed me to a somewhat savage attack in the Oxford Magazine, an attack concluding with the assertion that my Introduction displayed "a personal attitude almost inconceivable in a rational European, and a style unpardonable in a university teacher." 

 (The review in question appeared in the Oxford Magazine of May 25, 1892, page 394, '~the prominence given to the Bib in this book is an absurd violation of historical perspective; and the translations of the Traveller's Narrative a waste of the powers and opportunities of a Persian 

Scholar.") Increasing      

 age and experience (more's the pity!) are apt enough, even without the assistance of the Oxford Magazine, to modify our enthusiasm; but in this case, at least, time has so far vindicated my judgment against that of my Oxford reviewer that he could scarcely now maintain, as he formerly asserted, that the BThi religion "had affected the least important part of the Muslim World, and that not deeply." Every one who is in the slightest degree conversant with the actual state of things (September 27, 1903), in Persia now recognizes that the number and influence of the B&bis in that country is immensely greater than it was fifteen years ago.

 A  Traveller's Narrative, page 309 —  The appearance of such a woman as Qurratu'1-~Ayn is in any country and any age a rare phenomenon, but in such a country  as Persia it is a prodigy — nay, almost a miracle. Alike in virtue of her marvelous beauty, her rare intellectual gifts, her fervid eloquence, her fearless devotion and her glorious martyrdom, she stands forth incomparable and immortal amidst her countrywomen.  Had the Bab religion no other claim to greatness, this were sufficient — that it produced a heroine like Qurratu~1~cAyn. 
                           
Introduction to A Traveller's

 Narrative, pages ix, x —  Though I dimly suspected whither I was going and whom I was to behold (for no distinct intimation had been given to me), a second or two elapsed crc, with a throb of wonder and awe, I became definitely conscious that the room was not untenanted. In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt headdress of the kind called t6.j by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. 

 The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied  an age which the jetblack hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain. 

 A mild, dignified voice bade me be seated, and then continued: Praise be to God, that thou Last attained!       Thou hast come to see a prisoner and an exile.             We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; yet they deem us

  a stirrer-up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment. That all isa —  tions should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of 'men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled  — what harm is there in this? 

 Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the ~Most Great Peace' shall come. Do not you in Europe need this also? Is not this that which Christ foretold? 

 Yet do we see your kings and riders lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the destruction of the human. race than on that which would conduce to the hap piness of mankind. 

 These stifles and this bloodshed  and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family      Let not a man glory in this that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this; that he ioves his kind. 

 Such, so far as I can recall them, were the words which, besides many others, I heard from Baha. Let those who read them consider well with themselves whether such doctrines merit death and bonds, and whether the world is more iikeiy to gain or lose by their diffusion. 
                          
Introduction to A Traveller's

 Narrative, pages xxxv, xxxvi —  Seldom tave I seen one whose appearance impressed me more. A tall, strongly built man holding himself straight as an arrow, with white turban and raiment, long black locks reaching almost to the shoulder, broad powerful forehead, indicating a strong intellect,  combined with an unswerving will, eyes keen as a hawk's, and strongly marked but pleasing features — such was my first impression of Abbas Effendi, ccThe Master" (cAgip) as he par excellence is called by the Bab's. Subsequent conversation with him served oniy to heighten the respect with which his appearance had from the first inspired me. 

 One more eloquent of speech, ready of argument, more apt of illus — tration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians and the Muhammadans, could, I should think, be scarcely found even amongst the eloquent, ready and subtle race to which he belongs. These qualities, combined with a bearing at once majestic and genial, made me cease to wonder at the influence and esteem which he enjoyed even beyond the circle of his father's followers. 

 About the greatness of this man and his power no one who had seen him could entertain a doubt.

Excerpts from Comparative 

 Religions, pages 70, 71 —  From that subtle race issues the most remarkable movement which modern Muhammadanism has produced. Disciples gathered round him, and the movement was not checked by his arrest, his imprisonment for nearly six years and his final execution in 1850. It, too, claims to be a universal  teaching; it has already its noble army of martyrs and its holy books; has Persia, in the midst of her miseries, given birth to a religion which will go round the world?

Excerpts from The Reconciliation

 of Races and Religions, (1914) —  There was living quite lately a human being ' of such consummate excellence that many think it is both permissible and inevitable  even to identify him mystically with the invisible Godhead. 

 His2 combination  of mildness and power is so rare that we have to place him in a line with supernormal men. 'We learn that, at great points in his career after he had been in an ecstasy, such radiance of might and majesty streamed from his countenance that none could bear to look upon the effulgence of his glory and beauty. 

 Nor was it an uncommon occurrence for unbelievers involuntarily  to bow down in lowly obeisance on beholding His Holiness.

  The gentle spirit of the Bib is surely high up in the cycles of eternity. 

 Who can fail, as Professor Browne says, to be attracted by him? ccHis sorrowful and persecuted life; his purity of conduct and youth; his courage  and uncomplaining patience under misfortune;  his complete self-negation; the dim ideal of a better state of things which can be discerned through the obscure mystic utterances of the Baydn; but most of all, his tragic death, all serve to enlist our sympa —  thies on behalf of the young prophet of Shiraz.

(Mons. Nicolas.)          

 If there has been any prophet in recent times, it is to Baha'u'llah that we must go. Character is the final judge. Baha'u'llah was a man of the highest class — that of prophets. 

 But he was free from the last infirmity of noble minds, and would certainly  not have separated himself from others. He would have understood the saying: "Would God all the Lord's people were prophets!" What he does say, however,  is just as fine: "I do nOt desire lordship over others; I desire all men to be even as I am." 

 The day is not far off when the details of tAbdu'1-Bah~'s missionary journeys  will be admitted to be of historical  importance. 

 How gentle and wise he was, hundreds could testify from personal  knowledge, and I, too, could perhaps say something. I will only, however, give here the outward framework of cAb~ du'1-Bah?s life, and of his apostolic journeys, with the help of my friend Lutfull4h. 

 During his stay in London lie visited Oxford  (where he and his party — of Persians mainly — were the guests of Professor and Mrs. Cheyne), Edinburgh, 

Clifton and Woking. It    

 is fitting to notice here that the audience at Oxford, though highly academic,  seemed to be deeply interested, and that Dr. Carpenter made an admirable speech.

  Testimonial to the Religion of cAbdu~1~BaM. (Published in Egyptian Gazette, Sept. 24, 1913, by Mrs. J.

 The loving epistle which you have condescended to write to this servant, and the rug which you have forwarded, came safely to hand. The time of the meeting with your Excellency, and the memory of the benediction of your presence, recurred to the memory of this servant, and I am longing for the time when I shall meet you again. Although I have traveled through many countries and cities of IslAm, yet have I never met so lofty a character and so exalted a personage as your Excellency, and I can bear witness that it is not possible to find such another. On this account, I am hoping that the ideals and accomplishments of your Excellency may be crowned with success and yield results under all conditions; because behind these ideals and deeds I easily discern the eternal we'-f  are and prosperity of the world of humanity. 

 This servant, in order to gain firsthand information and experience, entered into the ranks of various religions, that is, outwardly, I became a Jew, Christian, 

Muhammadan  and Zoroastrian.

 I discovered that the devotees of these various religions do nothing else but hate and anathematize each other, that all their religions have become the instruments of tyranny and oppression in the hands of rulers and governors, and that they are the causes of the destruction of the world of humanity. 

 Considering those evil results, every person is forced by necessity to enlist himself on the side of your Excellency, and accept with joy the prospect of a fundamental basis for a universal religion of God, being laid through your efforts. 

 I have seen the father of your Excellency from afar. I have realized the self-sacrifice

 For the principles and aims of your Excellency, I express the utmost respect and devotion, and if God, the Most High, confers  long life, I will be able to serve you under all conditions.

 of the East (Macmillan & Co., London, 1913.) —  BaM'isrn is now estimated to count more than two million adherents, mostly composed  of Persian and Indian Shi'ihs, but including  also many Sunnis from the Turkish Empire and North Africa, and not a few Brahrnans, Buddists, Taoists, Shintoists and Jews. 

 It possesses even European converts, and has made some headway in the United States. 

 Of all the religions which have been encountered in the course of this journey —  the stagnant pooh of Oriental Christianity, the strange survivals of sun-worship, and idolatry tinged with Mubammadanism, the immutable relic of the Surnerians — ir is the only one which is alive, which is aggressive, which is extending its frontiers, instead of secluding itself within its ancient haunts.

of Indian Defense, chapter 

XI, page 116 (The Revival 

 of B4biism.) —  When one has been like Sa!di, a great personage,  and then a common soldier, and then a prisoner of a Christian feudal chief; when one has worked as a navvy on the fortifications of the Count of Antioch, and wandered back afoot to Shir~z after infinite pain and labor, he may well be disposed to think that nothing that exists is real, or, at least, has any substantial reality worth clinging to. Today the public peace of Persia is no longer subject to such violent perturbations. 

 At least, as far as we are concerned, the appearances of peace prevail, and few of us care or have occasion to look beyond the appearances. But for the Persians themselves, have the conditions very much changed? Do they not witness one day the sudden rise of this or that favorite of fortune  and the next day his sudden fall? Have they not seen the Atibak~i~Aczam twice hold sway as the ShAh's all-powerful Vazir, and twice hurled down from that pinnacle by a bolt from the blue? How many other ministers and governors have sat for a time on the seats of the mighty and been swept away by some intrigue as sordid as that to which they owed their own exaltation? 

 And how many in humbler stations have been in the meantime the recipients of their unworthy favors or the victims of their arbitrary oppression? 

 A village which but yesterday was fairly prosperous is beggared  today by some neighboring landlord higher up the valley, who, having duly propitiated  those in authority, diverts for the benefit of his own estates the whole of its slender supply of water. The progress of a governor or royal prince, with all his customary  retinue of ravenous hangers-on, eats out the countryside through which it passes more effectually than a flight of locusts. The visitation is as ruinous and as unaccountable.  Is it not the absence of all visible moral correlation of cause and effect in these phenomena of daily life that has gone far to produce the stolid fatalism of the masses, the scoffing skepticism of the more educated classes, and from time to time the revolt of some nobler minds? Of such the most recent and perhaps the noblest  of all became the founder of Bibjism. Chapter XI, page 120 —  The BTh was dead, but not BAbiism. 

He

Excerpts from Comparative  

 Religion and the Religion of the Future, pages 8 191 —  Inasmuch as a fellowship of faiths is at once the dearest hope and ultimate goal of the Baha'i movement, it behooves us to take cognizance of it and its mission. 

 Today  this religious movement has a million and more adherents, including people from all parts of the globe and representing a remarkable variety of race, color, class and creed. 

 It has been given literary expression in a veritable library of Asiatic, European, and American works to which additions are annually made as the movement grows and grapples with the great problems that grow out of its cardinal teachings. It has a long roll of martyrs for the cause for which it stands, twenty thousand in Persia alone, proving it to be a movement worth dying for as well as worth living by. 

 From its inception it has been identified with Baha'u'llah, who paid the price of prolonged exile, imprisonment, bodily suffering, and mental anguish for the faith he cherished  — a man of imposing personality as revealed in his writings, characterized by intense moral earnestness and profound spirituality, gifted with the selfsame power so conspicuous in the character of Jesus, the power to appreciate people ideally, that is, to see them at the level of their best and to make even the lowest types think well of themselves because of potentialities within them to which he pointed, but of which they were wholly unaware; a prophet whose greatest contribution was not any specific doctrine he proclaimed, but an informing spiritual power breathed into the world through the example of his Life and thereby quickening souls into new spiritual activ-fry.  Surely a movement of which all this can be said deserves — nay, compels — our respectful recognition and sincere appreciation. 

 Taking precedence over all else in its gospel is the message of unity in religion.  It is the crowning glory of the Baha movement that, while deprecating sectarianism in its preaching, it has faithfully  practised what it preached by refraining from becoming itself a sect. 

 Its representatives do not attempt to impose any beliefs upon others, whether by argument or bribery; rather do they seek to put beliefs that have illumined their own lives within the reach of those who feel they need illumination. No, not a sect, not a part of humanity cut off from all the rest, living for itself and aiming to convert all the rest into material for its own growth; no, not that, but a leaven, causing spiritual fermentation in all religions, quickening them with the spirit of catholicity and fraternalism. 

 Who shall say but that just as the little company of the Mayflower, landing on Plymouth Rock, proved to be the small beginning of a mighty nation, the ideal germ of a democracy which, if true to its

A Historical and Literary  

 Sketch" (translated by C.  K. Narirnan), and incorporated in Persia anti Pcrrsis, Part I, edited by G. K. Nariman. 

 Published under patronage of the IrAn League, Bombay, 

1925. (The Marker Literary 

 Series for Persia, No. 2.) —  The political reprieve brought about by the $6f is did nor result in the regeneration of thought. But the last century which marks the end of Persia has had its revival and twofold revival, literary and religious. The funeral ceremonies by which Persia celebrates every year for centuries — the fatal day of the 10th of Mubarrarn, when the son of ~A1i breathed his last at Karbili — have developed a popular theater and produced a sincere poetry, dramatic and human, which is worth all the rhetoric of the poets. During the same times an attempt at religious renovation was made, the religion of B~biisrn. 

 Demoralized for centuries by ten foreign conquests, by the yoke of a composite religion in which she believed just enough to persecute, by the enervating influence of a mystical philosophy which disabled men for action and divested life of all aim and objects, Persia has been making unexpected efforts for the last fifty-five years to remake for herself a virile ideal. Bkbiism has little of originality in its dogmas and mythology. 

 Its mystic doctrine takes its rise from S~fism and the old sects of the Aijides formed around the dogma of divine incarnation. But the morality it inculcates is a revolu-don.  It has the ethics of the West. 

 It suppresses lawftil impurities which are a great barrier dividing Jsl6rn from Christendom. 

 It denounces polygamy, the fruitful source of Oriental degeneration. 

 It seeks to reconstitute the family and it elevates man and in elevating him exalts woman tip to his level. Bibiisrn, which diffused itself in less than five years from one end of Persia to another, which was bathed in 1852 in the blood of its martyrs, has been silently progressing and propagating itself. If Persia is to be at all regenerate it will be through this new faith.

Excerpts from Contemporary 

 Studies, Part III, page 131. (Allan & Unwin, London, 1924.) —  We Westerners are too apt to imagine that the huge continent of Asia is sleeping as soundly as a mummy. NVe smile at the vanity of the ancient Hebrews, who believed  themselves to be the chosen peopie. 'We are amazed at the intolerance of the Greeks and the Romans, who looked upon the members of all races as barbarians. Nevertheless, we ourselves are like the Hebrews, the Greeks and the Romans. As Europeans we believe Europe to be the oniy world that matters, though from time to time we may turn a paternal eye towards America, regarding our offspring in the New World with mingled feelings of condescension  and pride. 

 Nevertheless, the great cataclysm of 1914 is leading some of us to undertake a critical examination of the inviolable dogma that the European nations are the elect. Has there not been of late years a demonstration of the nullity of modern civilization — the nullity which had already been proclaimed by Rousseau, Carlyle, Ruskin, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche? NQTe are now inclined to listen more attentively to whispers from the East. Our self-complacency has been disturbed by such utterances as that of Rabindranath Tagore, who, lecturing at the Imperial University  of Tokio on June 18, 1916, foretold a great future for Asia. 

 The political civilization of Europe was cccarnivorous and cannibalistic in its tendencies." The East was patient, and could afford to wait till the West, (churry after the expedient," had to halt for want of breath. ~Europe, while busily speeding to her engagements, disdainfully  casts her glance from her carriage window at the reaper reaping his harvest in

  the field, and in her intoxication of speed, cannot but think him as slow and ever receding  backwards. 

 But the speed comes to its end, the engagement loses its meaning, and the hungry heart clamors for food, till at last she comes to the lonely reaper reaping  his harvest in the sun. For if the office cannot wait, or the buying and selling, or the craving for excitement — love waits, and beauty, and the wisdom of suffering and the fruits of patient devotion and reverent meekness of simple faith. And thus shall wait the East till her time comes. 

 Being thus led to turn our eyes towards Asia, we are astonished to find how much we have misunderstood it; and we blush when we realize our previous ignorance of the fact that, towards the middle of the nineteenth century, Asia gave birth to a great religious movement — a movement signalized for its spiritual purity, one which has had thousands of martyrs, one which Tolstoy has described. H. Dreyfus, the French historian of this movement, says that it is not "a new religion," but religion  renewed," and that it provides t~the only possible basis for a mutual understanding between religion and free thought." Above all, we are impressed by the fact that, in our own time, such a manifestation can occur, and that the new faith should have undergone a development far more extensive than that undergone in the same space of time nearly two thousand years ago, by budding Christianity. 

 At the present time, the majority of the inhabitants of Persia have, to a varying  extent, accepted the Bibjist faith. In the great towns of Europe, America, and Asia, there are active centers for the propaganda  of the liberal ideas and the doctrine of human community, which form the foundations of Bahi'ist teaching. 

 We shall not grasp the full significance of this tendency until we pass from the description of Bahi'ism as a theory to that of Bahi'ism as a practice, for the core of religion is not metaphysics, but morality. 

 The BaM'ist ethical code is dominated by the law of love taught by Jesus and by all the prophets. 

 In the thousand and one details  of practical life, this law is subject to manifold interpretations. 

That of Bahi'u —             

 'llih is unquestionably one of the most comprehensive of these, one of the most exalted,  one of the most satisfactory to the modern mind. 

 That is why Baha'u'llah is a severe critic of the patriotism which plays so large a part in the national life of our day. Love of our native land is legitimate, but this love must not be exclusive. A man should love his country more than he loves his house (this is the dogma held by every patriot) ; but Baha'u'llah adds that he should love the divine world more than he loves his country. 

 From this standpoint, patriotism is seen to be an intermediate stage on the road of renunciation, an incomplete  and hybrid religion, something we have to get beyond. Throughout his life Baha'u'llah regarded the ideal universal peace as one of the most important of his aims. 

 Baha'u'llah is in this respect enunciating  a novel and fruitful idea. 

 There is a better way of dealing with social evils than by trying to cure them after they have come to pass. We should try to prevent them by removing their causes, which act on the individual, and especially on the child. 

 Nothing can be more plastic than the nature of the child. 'The government's first duty must be to provide for the care-fu~  and efficient education of children, remembering that education is something more than instruction. This will be an enormous step towards the solution of the social problem, and to take such a step will be the first task of the Baha'u'llah

 is ordained upon every father to rear his son or his daughter by means of the sciences, the arts, and all the commandments; and if any one should neglect  to do so, then the members of the council, should the offender be a wealthy man, must levy from him the sum necessary for the education of his child. When the neglectful parent is poor, the cost of the necessary education must be borne by the council, which will provide a refuge for the unfortunate." 

 The Baytu'I-tAd'1, likewise, must prepare the way for the establishment of universal peace, doing this by organizing courts of arbitration and by influencing the govern

  ments. Long before the Esperantists had begun their campaign, and more than twenty years before Nicholas II had summoned the first Hague congress, Baha'u'llah  was insisting on the need for a universal language and courts of arbitration. He returns to these matters again and again: "Let all the nations become one in faith, and let all men be brothers, in order that the bonds of affection and unity between  the sons of men may be strengthened. 

 What harm Can there be in that? 
It is going to happen.     

 There will be an end to sterile conflicts, to ruinous wars; and the Great Peace will come!" Such were the words of Baha'u'llah in 1890, two years before his death. 

 'While adopting and developing the Christian  law of love, Baha'u'llah rejected the Christian principle of asceticism. 

 He discountenanced the macerations which were a nightmare of the Middle Ages, and whose evil effects persist even in our own days. 

 Baha'ism, then, is an ethical system, a system of social morality. But it would be a mistake to regard BaM'ist teaching as a collection of abstract rules imposed from without. Baha'ism is permeated with a sane and noble mysticism; nothing could be more firmly rooted in the inner life, more benignly spiritual; nothing could speak more intimately to the soul, in low tones, and as if from within. 

 Such is the new voice that sounds to us from Asia; such is the new dawn in the East. We should give them our close attention; we should abandon our customary mood of disdainful superiority. Doubtless, Baha'u'llah's teaching is not definitive. The Persian prophet does not offer it to us as such. 

 Nor can we Europeans assimilate all of it; for modern science leads us to make certain claims in matters of thought — claims we cannot relinquish, claims we should not try to forego. But even though Baha'u'llah's precepts (like those of the Gospels) may not fully satisfy all these intellectual demands, they are rarely in conflict  with our scientific outlooks. If they are to become our own spiritual food, they must be supplemented, they must be relived  by the religious spirits of Europe, must be rethought by minds schooled in the Western mode of thought. But, in its existing form, Bahi'ist teaching may serve, amid our present chaos, to open for us a road leading to solace and to comfort; may restore our confidence in the spiritual destiny  of man. 

 It reveals to us how the human mind is in travail; it gives us an inkling of the fact that the greatest happenings  of the day are not the ones we were inclined to regard as the most momentous, not the ones which are making the loudest noise.

 To this divine knowledge we owe all we are, all we hope for. We are rising gradually toward that image, and vie owe to our fellowmen to aid them in returning to it in the Glory of God and the Beauty of Holiness. 

 It is a celestial privilege and with it comes a high responsibility, from which there is no escape. 

 In the Palace of Baha, or Delight, just outside the Fortress of CAkl(j on the Syrian coast, there died a few months since, a famous Persian sage, the B~bi Saint, named Baha'u'llah — the ~~G1 of God" — the head of that vast reform party of Persian Muslims, who accept the New Testament as the Word of God and Christ as the Deliverer  of men, who regard all nations as one, and all men as brothers. Three years ago he was visited by a Cambridge scholar and gave utterance to sentiments so noble, so Christlike, that we repeat them as our closing words: "That all nations should become one in faith and alt men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that

 CURZON Excerpts from Persia, Vol. I, pages 4965 04. 

 ('Written in 1892.) —  Beauty and the female sex also lent their consecration to the new creed and the heroism of the lovely but ill-fated poetess of Qazvin, Zarrin-Tij (Crown of Gold) or Qurratu~1~cAyn (Solace of the Eyes), who, throwing off the veil, carried the missionary torch far and wide, is one of the most affecting episodes in modern history. 

 The lowest estimate places the present nuni-ber  of Bab's in Persia at half a million. I am disposed to think, from conversations with persons well qualified to judge, that the total is nearer one million. 

 They are to be found in every walk of life, from the ministers and nobles of the Court to the scavenger or the groom, not the least arena of their activity being the Mussulman priesthood itself. It will have been noticed that the movement was initiated by Siyyids, H4jis and Mulhs, i.e., persons who, either by descent, from pious inclination, or by profession, were intimately concerned with the Mubarnmadan creed; and it is among even the professed votaries of the faith that they continue to make their converts. 

 Quite recently the Bab's have had great success in the camp of another enemy, having secured many proselytes among the Jewish populations of the Persian towns. I hear that during the past year (1891) they are reported to have made 15 0 Jewish converts in Tihr~n, 100 in Hamadin, 50 in K~shin, and 75 per cent of the Jews at Gulp~iyigAn. 

 The two victims, whose names were HAji Mirza Hasan and Hiji Mirza Husayn, have been renamed by the B&bis: Sultinu'sh-Shuhadi', or King of Martyrs, and Mahbiibu'sh-Shuhadi', or Beloved  of Martyrs — and their naked graves in the cemetery have become places of pilgrimage  where many a tear is shed over the fate of the ttMartyrs of J~fTh~n." 

 It is these little incidents, protruding from time to time their ugly features, that prove Persia to be not as yet quite redeemed, and that somewhat staggers the tall-talkers about I r~nian civilization. 

 If one conclusion  more than another has been forced upon our notice by the retrospect in which I have indulged, it is that a sublime and murmuring 7] devotion has been inculcated by this new faith, whatever it be. There is, I believe, but one instance of a Bab having recanted under pressure of menace of suffering, and he reverted to the faith and was executed within two years. Tales of magnificent heroism illumine the bloodstained pages of B~bi history. 

 Ignorant  and unlettered as many of its votaries are, and have been, they are yet prepared to die for their religion, and fires of Smithfield  did not kindle a nobler courage than has met and defied the more refined torture-mongers of Tihr~n. Of no small account, then, must be the tenets of a creed that can awaken in its followers so rare and beautiful a spirit of self-sacrifice. 

 From the facts that BAbjism in its earliest years found itself in conflict with the civil powers and that an attempt was made by Bab's upon the life of the Sh&h, it has been wrongly inferred that the movement was political in origin and Nihilist in character. It does not appear from a study of the writings either of the Bab or his successors, that there is any foundation for such a suspicion. 

 •The charge of immorality seems to have arisen partly from the malignant inventions of opponents, partly from the much greater freedom claimed for women by the Bib, which in the oriental mind is scarcely dissociable from profligacy of conduct. 

 if Bkbiism continues to grow at its present rate of progression, a time may conceivably come when it will oust Muhaminadanism from the field in Persia. 

 •Since its recruits are won from the best soldiers of the garrison whom it is attacking, there is greater reason to believe that it may ultimately prevail. 

 The pure and suffering life of the Bab, his ignominious  death, the heroism and martyrdom

B~ SIR FRANCIS YOUNGHUSBAND
                           
Excerpts from The Gleam.   

 (1923.) — The story of the Bib, as Mirza ~AIA Mu-bammad called himself, was the story of spiritual heroism unsurpassed in Svabhava's experience; and his own adventurous sod was fired by it. That a youth of no social influence and no education should, by the simple power of insight, be able to pierce into the heart of things and see the real truth, and then hold on to it with such firmness of conviction and present it with such suasion that he was able to convince men that he was the Messiah and get them to follow him to death itself, was one of those splendid facts in human history that Svabhava loved to meditate on. This was a true hero whom he would wish to emulate and whose experiences he would profit by. The Bib's passionate sincerity could nor be doubted, for he had given his life for his faith. And that there must be something in his message that appealed to men and satisfied their souls, was witnessed to by the fact that thousands gave their lives in his cause and millions now follow him. 

 If a young man could, in oniy six years of ministry, by the sincerity of his purpose and the attraction of his personality, so inspire rich and poor, cultured and illiterate, alike, with belief in himself and his doctrines  that they would remain staunch, though hunted down and without trial sentenced  to death, sawn asunder, strangled, shot, blown from guns; and if men of high position and culture in Persia, Turkey and Egypt in numbers to this day adhere to his doctrines, his life must be one of those events in the last hundred years which is really worth study. And that study fortunately  has been made by the Frenchman Gobineau and by Professor E. G. Browne, so that we are able to have a faithful representation  of its main features. 

 Thus, in only his thirtieth year, in the year 1850, ended the heroic career of a true God-man. Of the sincerity of his convic-non  that he was God-appointed, the manner  of his death is the amplest possible proof. 

 in the belief that he would thereby save others from the error of their present beliefs he willingly sacrificed his life. 

 And of his power of attaching men to him, the passionate devotion of hundreds and even thousands of men who gave their lives in his cause is convincing testimony. 

 He himself was but letter out of that most mighty book, a dewdrop from that limitless ocean." 

 The One to come would reveal all mysteries and all riddles. This was the humility of true insight. 
And it has had its effect. 

 His movement has grown and expanded, and it has yet a great future' before it. During his six years of ministry, four of which were spent in captivity, he had permeated  all Persia with his ideas. 

 And since his death the movement has spread to Turkey, Egypt, India and even into Europe and America. 

 His adherents are now numbered  by millions. 

 The spirit which pervades them, says Professor Browne, "is such that it cannot fail to affect most powerfully all subject to its influence." 

  For many years I have been interested in the rise and progress of the Baha Movement.  Its roots go deep down into the past and yet it looks far forward into the future. 

 It realizes and preaches the oneness  of mankind. 

 And I have noticed how ardently its followers work for the furtherance  of peace and for the general welfare of mankind. God must be with them and their success therefore assured.

  had been done to death in captivity. But Baha'u'llah lived. The One who shall be made manifest was alive. 

 And in him and in others had been engendered such love for the BTh and what he stood for as, in the words of the chronicler, no eye had ever beheld nor mortal heart conceived: if branches of every tree were turned into pens, and all the seas into ink, and Earth and Heaven rolled into one parchment, the immensity of that iove would still remain untold. 

 This love for the Cause still survived. And it was sufficient. Baha'u'llah was, indeed, despoiled of his possessions,  deserted by his friends, driven into exile from his native land and, even in exile, confined to his house. 

 But in him the Cause was still alive — and more than alive, purified and ennobled by the fiery trials through which it had passed. 

 Under the wise control, and direction of Baha'u'llah from his prison-house, first at BaghdAd and then at CAkiji in Syria, there grew what is now known as the Baha'i Movement which, silently propagating itself,  has now spread to Europe and America as well as to India and Egypt, while the bodily remains of the BTh, long secretly guarded, now find a resting-place on Mount Carmel in a Tomb-shrine, which is a place of pilgrimage to visitors from all over the world.

  Baha at Oxford" —           
Common                    

 tAbdu'1-BahA addressed a large and deeply interested audience at Manchester College, Oxford, on December 31. The Persian leader spoke in his native tongue, Mirza A1?mad Sohrab interpreting. 

Principal Esdin Carpenter 

 presided, and introduced the speaker by saying that they owed the honor and pleasure of meeting tAbdu'1-BahA to their revered friend, Dr. Cheyne, who was deeply interested in the Baha'i teaching. 

 The movement sprung up during  the middle of the last century in Persia, with the advent of a young Mubammadan who took to himself the title of the Bib (meaning door or gate, through which men could arrive at the knowledge or truth of God), and who commenced teaching in Persia in the year 1844. The purity of his character, the nobility of his words, aroused great enthusiasm. 

 He was, however, subjected to great hostility by the authorities, who secured his arrest and imprisonment, and he was finally executed in 1850. But the movement went on, and the writings of the Bib, which had been copious, were widely read. The movement has been brought into India, Europe, and the United States. 

 It does not seek to create a new sect, but to inspire all sects with a deep fundamental love. The late Dr. Jowett once said to him that he had been so deeply impressed with the teachings and character of the B~b that he thought Bibjism, as the present movement was then known, might become the greatest religious movement since the birth of Christ.

 religion has made its way •because it meets the needs of its day. It fits the larger outlook of our time better than the rigid exclusive older faiths. 

 A characteristic is its unexpected liberality and toleration. It accepts all the great religions as true, and their scriptures as inspired. The Bah6Nsts bid the followers of these faiths disentangle from the windings  of racial, particularist, local prejudices, the vital, immortal thread, the pure gospel of eternal worth, and to apply this essential element to life. 

 Instances are quoted of people being recommended to work within the older faiths, to remain, vitalizing them upon the principles of the new faith. They cannot fear new facts, new truths as the Creed-defenders must. They believe in a progressive revelation. 

 They admit the cogency of modern criticism and allow that God is in His nature incomprehensible, but is to be known through 

His manifestations.  Their

  to designate ccChrist1ike.~~ ccwhat does he do to his enemies that he makes them his friends?" was asked concerning the late leader. What astonishes the student is not anything in the ethics or philosophy of this movement, but the extraordinary response its ideal has awakened in such numbers of people, the powerful influence this standard actually exerts on conduct. It is due to four things: (1) It makes a call on the Heroic Element in man. It offers no bribe. It bids men endure, give up, carry the cross. It calls them to sacrifice, to bear torture, to suffer martyrdom, to brave death. 

 (2) It offers liberty of thought. Even upon such a vital question as immortality it will not bind opinion. 

 Its atmosphere is one of trust and hope, not of dogmatic chill. (3) It is a religion of love. 

 ccNotwithsta1~ding the interminable catalogue of extreme and almost incredible sufferings and privations which this heroic band of men and women have endured — more terrible than many martyrdoms — there is not a trace of resentment or bitterness to be observed among them. One would suppose that they were the most fortunate of the people among whom they live, as indeed they do certainly consider themselves, in that they have been permitted to live near their beloved Lord, beside which they count their sufferings as nothing" (Phelps) Love for the Master, love for the brethren, love for the neighbors,  love for the alien, love for all human-fry,  love for all life, love for God — the old, well-tried way trod once before in Syria, trodden again. (4) It is a religion in ,bar-inony  with science. 

 It has here the advantage of being thirteen centuries later than IslAm. This new dispensation has been tried in the furnace, and has not been found wanting. 

 It has been proved valid by the lives of those who have endured all things on its behalf. 

 Here is something more appealing than its logic and rational philosophy.  t~To the Western observer" (writes Prof. 

 Browne), ctk is the complete sincerity of the BTh is, their fearless disregard of death and torture undergone for the sake of their religion, their certain conviction as to the truth of their faith, their generally admirable conduct toward mankind, especially toward their fellow-believers, which constitute their strongest claim on his attention."

We cannot fail to see in its activity another proof of the living witness in our own day of the working of the sleepless spirit of God in the hearts of men, for He cannot rest, by the necessity of His nature, until He hath made in conscious reality, as in power, the whole world His own.

  The dominant impression that survives in my memory of rAbdu~1~Bahi is that of an extraordinary nobility: physically, in the head so massive yet so finely poised, and the modeling of the features; but spiritually,  in the serenity of expression, and the suggestion of grave and responsible meditation in the deeper lines of the face. But there was also, in his complexion, carriage,  and expression, an assurance of the complete health which is a requisite of a sane judgment. And when, as in a lighter mood, his features relaxed into the playful, the assurance was added of a sense of humor without which there is no true sense of proportion. 

 I have never met any one concerned with the philosophies of life whose judgment might seem so reliable in matters of practical conduct. 

 My regret is that my meetings with him were so few and that I could not benefit by a lengthier contact with a personality combining a dignity so impressive with human traits so engaging. 

 I wish that he could be multiplied!

  Translated from a letter to Mine. Isabel Grinevskaya, Oct. 22, 1903 I am very glad that Mr. V. V. Stassov has told you of the good impression which your book has made on me, and I thank you for sending it. I have known about the Bab's for a long time, and have always been interested in their teachings. 
It seems to me that these

  teachings, as well as all the rationalistic social religious teachings that have arisen lately out of the original teachings of Baha —  manism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity and Jshrn distorted by the priests, have a great future for this very reason that these teachings, discarding all these distorting incrustations that cause division, aspire to unite into one common religion of all mankind. 

 Therefore, the teachings of the Bab's, inasmuch as they have rejected the old Muluarnrnadan superstitions and have not established new superstitions which would divide ihem from other new superstitions (unfortunately something of the kind is noticed in the exposition of the Teachings of the Bib), and inasmuch as they keep to the principal fundamental ideas of brotherhood,  equality and love, have a great future before them. 

 In the Mulj.arnmadan religion there has been lately going on an intensive spiritual movement. I know that one such movement is centered in the French colonies in Africa, and has its name (I do not rernern-her  it), and its prophet. Another movement exists in India, Lahore, and also has its prophet and publishes its paper 

C!Ri                      
of Religions."            

 Both these religious teachings contain nothing new, neither do they have for their principal object a changing of the outlook of the people and thus do not change the lationship between the people, as is the case with Bibiisn-i, though not so much in its theory (Teachings of the Bib) as in the practice of life as far as I know it. I therefore  sympathize with BThiism with all my heart inasmuch as it teaches people brotherhood and equality and sacrifice of material life for service to God. 

  Translated from a letter to Frid ul Khan Wadelbekow (This cornmun~cation is dated 1908 and is found among epistles written to Caucasian  Muhammadans.) 

  In answer to your letter which questions how one should understand the term God, I send you a collection of writings from my literary and reading club, in which some thoughts upon the nature of God are included. In my opinion if we were to free ourselves from all false conception of God we should, whether as Christians or Muhammadans free ourselves entirely from picturing God as a personality. The conception which then seems to me to be the best for meeting the requirements of reason and heart is found in 4th chap. St. John, 71215 that means God is Love. It therefore follows that God lives in us according to the measure or capacity of each soul to express His nature. This thought is implicit more or less clearly in all religions, and therefore in Muhammad anism. 

 Concerning your second question upon what awaits us after death I can oniy reply that on dying we return to God from whose Life we came. God, however, being Love we can on going over expect God only. 

 Concerning your third question, I answer that so far as I understand IslAm, like all other religions, Brahmanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, etc., it contains great basic truths but that these have become corrupted by superstition, and coarse interpre-rations and filled with unnecessary legendic descriptions. 

 I have had much help in my researches to get clear upon Muhammadanism by a splendid little book ccThe sayings of 

Muhammad."                

 The teachings of the Bab's which come to us out of Islim have through Bahi'u-'lhh's teachings been gradually developed and now present us with the highest and purest form of religious teaching. 
                          
B~ DR. EDMUND PRIVAT      

  The practical and spiritual understanding  between nations, the realization of the unity of mankind above all barriers of language and religion, the feeling of responsibility  towards all who suffer from grief or injustice, are oniy different branches of the same central teaching which gives the Baha'i Movement such a faithful and active family of workers in so many countries.

  B~ FREDERICK W. OAKES      

  The Enlightener of human minds in respect  to their religious foundations and privileges is of such vital importance that no one is safe who does not stop and listen for its quiet meaning, and is to the mind of men, as the cooling breeze that unseen passes its breath over the varying leaves of a tree. Watch it! And see how uniformly, like an unseen hand passing caressingly over all its leaves: Full of tender care and even in its gifts of love and greater life: Caresses each leaf. Such it is to one who has seated himself amid the flowers and fruit trees in the Garden Beautiful at 'Akka., just within the circle of that Holy and Blessed shrine where rests the Mortal part of the 

Great Enlightener. His     

 handiwork is there, you touch the fruit and flowers his hand gave new life's hopes to, and kneeling as I did beside Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Marvelous  Manifestation, felt the spirit's immortal love of Him who rests there. While I could not speak the words of the Litany, my soui knew the wondrous meaning, for every word was a word of the soul's language  that speaks of the Eternal love and care of the Eternal Father. So softly and so living were the reflections from his beautiful  personality, that one needed not spoken words to be interpreted. 

 And this Pilgrim came away renewed and refreshed to such a degree, that the hard bands of formalism were replaced by the freedom of love and light that will ever make that sojourn there the prize memory and the Door of revelation never to be closed again, and never becloud the glorious 

Truth of Universal Brotherhood.

 A calm, and glorious influence that claims the heart and whispers to each of the pulsing leaves of the great family in all experiences of life, ~tBe not afraid, It is I!" — And makes us long to help all the world to know the meaning of those words spoken by The Great Revealer, ttLet us strive with heart and soui that unity may dwell in the world." And to catch the greatness of the word "Strive," in quietness and reflection.

 Journal, Wick, Scotland I was in Chicago for only some ten days, yet it would take a hundred chapters to describe all the splendid sights and institutions  I was privileged to see. No doubt Chicago has more than its fair share of alien gangsters and gunmen, and the despicable doings of this obnoxious class has badly vitiated its civic life and reputation. 

 But for all that it is a magnificent city — in many respects probalAy the finest in America;  a city of which its residents have innumerable reasons to be proud. 

 Every day indeed was filled up with sightseeing and the enjoyment of lavish hospitality. 

 One day, for example, I was entertained to lunch at the Illinois Athletic Club as the guest of Mr. Robert Black, a

  prosperous Scot belonging to Wigtonshire, who is in the building trade. 

 He is an ex-president of the St. Andrew's Society. Mr. Falconer and other Scots friends were present, and they were all exceedingly kind and complimentary. 

 I could not, in short, have been treated with more distinction if I had been a prominent Minister of State instead of a humble Scottish journalist out on a mission of fraternity and good will. 

 On the same day I met by appointment Mr. Albert R. Windust with whom I went out to see the Baha'i Temple which is in course of being erected at 'Milmette, a suburb of Chicago on the shore of Lake Michigan. It is about an hour's ride out on the elevated railway. 

 Only the foundation  and basement have so far been constructed,  and the work was meanwhile stopped but, we understand, is now shortly to be resumed. 

 I have no hesitation in saying  that when completed this Tenpie will be one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture in the world. I had the privilege of an introduction to the architect, a rrenchinan, M. Bourgeois, who speaks English fluently. We spent a considerable time with him in his beautiful studio overlooking  the Lake, and he did me the honour of showing me the plans of the Temple, drawings which cost him years of toil, and they are far beyond anything I could have imagined in beauty and spiritual significance.  M. Bourgeois, who is well advanced in years, is a genius and mystic — a gentleman  of charming personality. 

 In all that I had the pleasure of seeing in his studio I had a privilege that is given to few. 

 My signature is in his personal book, which contains the names of some of the great ones of the earth! Mr. Windust, who is a leading Baha'i in the city, is a quiet and humble man, but full of fine ideas and ideals. 

 He treated me with the utmost brotherly courtesy. 

 How is it, I kept asking myself, that it should be mine to have all this privilege and honour? 

 There was no reason save that they told me I had touched the chords of truth and sincerity in referring to and reviewing the Baha'i writings and principles in a few short articles in this Journal. The Temple is designed to represent these principles — universal religion, universal brotherhood, universal education, and the union of science and religion. 

Meantime the Chicagoans  

 are seemingly indifferent to all its spiritual significance; but some day they will wake up to a realisation of the fact that its symbolism will mark the city as one of destiny in the world.

  Humanity is the better, the nobler, for the Baha'i Faith. it is a Faith that enriches  the soul; that rakes from life its dross. 

 I am prompted thus to express myself because of what I have seen, what I have heard, what I have read of the results of the Movement founded by the Reverend Baha'u'llah. 

 Embodied within that Movement  is the spirit of world brotherhood; that brotherhood that makes for unity of thought and action. 

 Though not a member of the Baha'i Faith, I sense its tremendous potency for good. Ever is it helping to usher in the dawn of the day of "Peace on 

Earth Good Will to Men."  

 By the spread of its teachings,  the Baha'i cause is slowly, yet steadily, making the Golden Rule a practical reality. 

 With the high idealism of Baha'u'llah as its guide, the Baha'i Faith is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. Countless are its good works. For example, to the pressing economic prob —  lerns it gives a new interpretation, a new solution. But above all else it is causing peoples everywhere to realize they are as one, by heart and spirit divinely united. 

 And so I find joy in paying this little tribute to a cause that is adding to the sweetness, the happiness, the cleanness of life.

  My contact with the Baha'i Movement and my acquaintance with its teachings, given by Hadrat-i-Bah6'u'llAh, have filled me with real joy, as I see that this Movement,  so cosmopolitan in its appeal, and so spiritual in its advocacy of Truth, is sure


<p470>

 to bring peace and joy to the hearts of millions. 

 Free from metaphysical subtleties, practical in its outlook, abcve all sectarianism, and based on God, the substratum of the human soui and the phenomenal world, the Baha'i Movement carries peace and illumination  with it. As long as it is kept free from orthodoxy and church-spirit, and above personalities, it will continue to be a blessing to its followers. 
                           
B~ SHRI PUROHIT SWAMI      

  I am in entire sympathy with all of the principles that the Baha'i Movement stands for; there is nothing which is contrary to what I am preaching. I think at this stage of the world such teachings arc needed more than anything else. 

 I find the keynote of the Teachings is the spiritual regeneration of the world. 

 The world is getting more and more spiritually bankrupt every day, and if it requires anything it requires spiritual life. The Baha'i Movement stands above all caste, creed and color and is based on pure spiritual unity. 

  B~ PROF. HERBERT A. MILLER 

  In World Unity Magazine    

  The central drive of the Baha Movement  is for human unity. It would secure this through unprejudiced search for truth, making religion conform to scientific discovery  and insisting that fundamentally all religions are alike. For the coming of urn —  versa1 peace, there is great foresight and wisdom as to details. Among other things there should be a universal language; so the Baha'is take a great interest in Esperanto though they do not insist on it as the ultimate  language. 

 No other religious movement has put so much cm~hasis on the emancipation and education of women. Everyone should work whether rich or poor and poverty should be abolished. 

 What will be the course of the Baha'i Movement no one can prophesy, but I think it is no exaggeration to claim that the program is the finest fruit of the religious contribution of Asia. 

 B~ THE RT. HON. SIR HERBERT SAMUEL, G.C.B., M.P. In John Q'London's Weekly, March 25th, 1933. 

  "It is possible indeed to pick out points of fundamental agreement among all creeds. That is the essential purpose of the Baha'i Religion, the foundation and growth of which is one of the most striking movements that have proceeded from the East in recent generations." 

  B~ REV. K. T. CHUNG (CLast summer upon my return from a visit to Japan, I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Keith Ransontt-Kehler on the boat. It was learnt that this lady is a teacher of the Baha'i Cause, so we conversed upon various subjects of human life very thoroughly. 

 It was soon found that what the lady imparted to me came from the source of Truth as I have felt inwardly all along, so I at once realized that the Baha'i Faith can offer numerous and profound benefits to mankind. 

 "My senior, Mr. Y. S. Tsao, is a well-read man. His mental capacity and deep experience  are far above the average man. He often said that during this period of our country when old beliefs have lost their hold upon the people, it is absolutely necessary to seek a religion of all-embracing Truth which may exert its powerful influence  in saving the situation. For the last ten years, he has investigated indefatigably into the teachings of the Baha'i Cause. Recently, he has completed his translations of the book on the New Era and showed me a copy of the proof. After carefully reading  it, I came to the full realization that the Truth as imparted to me by Mrs. Ransom-Kehier is veritable and unshakeable. This Truth of great value to mankind has been eminently translated by Mr. Tsao and now the Chinese people have the opportunity  of reading it, and I cannot but express my profound appreciation for the same. 

 Should the Truth of the Baha'i Faith be widely disseminated among the Chinese people, it will naturally lead to the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven. Should everybody again exert his efforts towards

  B~ REV. GRIFFITH J. SPARHAM 

Highgate Hill Unitarian   
Christian Church, London, 

England                   

  In his book ttA League of Religions," the Rev. J. Tyssul Davis, formerly minister of the Theistic Church in London, and at present minister of a Unitarian Church in Bristol, England, the writer sets out to demonstrate that each great religious movement  in the world has contributed something of peculiar importance to the spiritual life of man. Thus, he says, the great contribution of Zoroastrianism has been the thought of Purity; of Brabmanism that of Justice; of Muhammadanisrn that of Submission;  of Christianity that of Service; and so on. In each instance he lays his finger on the one thing par excellence for which the particular religious culture seemed to him to stand, and tries to catch its special contribution in an epigrammaric phrase. 

 Coining, in this way, to Baha'ism, he names it "the Religion of Reconciliation." 

 In his chapter on Bahi'ism he says: ccThe Baha'i religion has made its way because it meets the need of the day. It fits the larger outlook of our time, better than the rigid older faiths. A characteristic is its unexpected liberality and tolerance. lit accepts all the great religions as true and their scriptures as inspired." 

 This, then, as he sees Bah&'ism, is its


<p472>
472             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  essential features: liberality, toleration, the spirit of reconciliation; and that, not in the sense, as Mr. H. G. Wells has it in his "Soul of a Bishop," of making a "collection" of approved portions of the world's varied and differing creeds, but in the sense, as he also puts it in the same book, of achieving a great tcsimp1ification.~~ ceBah4~ists~~ says Dr. Davis, Thid the followers of these (that is, the world's) faiths disentangle from the windings of racial, particularist, local prejudices, the vital, immortal  thread of the pure gospel of eternal worth, and to apply this essential element to life." 

 That is Dr. Davis's interpretation of the genius of BaM'ism, and that it is a true one, no one who has studied Bah&isrn, even superfichilly, can question, least of all the outsider. Indeed one may go further and assert that no one who has studied Baha'ism, whether superficially or otherwise,  would wish to question it; particularly if he approaches the subject from a liberal and unprejudiced point of view. In the last act of his "'Wandering Jew," Mr. Temple Thurston puts into the mouth of 

Matteos, the Wandering     

 Jew, himself, the splendid line, "All men are Christians — all are Jews." He might equally well have written, "All men are Christians — all are Baha'is." For, if the sense of the Unity of Truth is a predominant  characteristic of liberally-minded people, whatever may be their religious tradition, it is predominantly a characteristic of Bahi'ism; since here is a religious system based, fundamentally, on the one, simple, profound, comprehensive doctrine of the unity of God, which carries with it, as its necessary corollary and consequence, the parallel doctrine of the unity of Man. 

 This, at all events, is the conviction of the present writer; and it is why, as a Unitarian,  building his own faith on the same basic principles of divine and human unity, he has long felt sympathy with and good will toward a religious culture which stands on a foundation identical with that of the faith he holds. And a religion that affirms the unity of things must of necessity be a religion of reconciliation; the truth of which in the case of Bah6'isn-i is clear.

  B~ HON. LILIAN HELEN MONTAGUE, J.P., D.H.L. As a Jewess I am interested in the Baha'i Community. 

 The teaching hys particular stress on the Unity of God and the Unity of Man, and incorporates the doctrine of the Hebrew Prophets that the Unity of God is revealed in the Unity of men. Also, we seem to share the conception of God's messengers  as being those people who in their deep reverence for the attributes of God, His beauty, His truth, His righteousness and His justice, seek to imitate Him in their imperfect human way. The light of God is reflected in the soul of him who seeks to be receptive. Like the members of the Baha'i community, we Jews are scattered all over the world, but united in a spiritual brotherhood. 

 The Peace ideal enumerated by the Hebrew Prophets is founded on faith in the ultimate triumph of God's justice and righteousness.

  n6e en Orient, et sa doctrine prend, dans les circonstances actuelles, un int&6t d'au-tant  pius grand que, s'&artant du domaine purement philosophique, elle pr6conise en 6conornie politique des solutions qui coincident curicusernent avec les pr~occupations de notre dpoque. 

 Cette religion, de plus, est par essence antiraciste. 

 Elle est n6e en Perse, vers 1840, at les trois proph6tes successifs qui 1'ont pr&h& sont des Persans, c'est-it-dire des musulmans de naissance. 

 Le premier, le crdateur, s'appelait le Bib. II prdcha vers 1850, a pr6conisa, outre la r~conci1iation des diff6rents cultes qui divi —  sent l'humanit6, Ia 1ib~ration de la femme, r6duite aujourd'hui encore un quasi escia-vage  dans tout l'Jslam. 

 Une Persane d'une rare beaut6, et qui, chose rare chez les musulmanes, 6tait dou6e d'un grand talent oratoire, r~pondant au nom diflicile ~ prononcer de Qourratou-'1-tATn, l'accompagna dans ses r6unions, n'h6si-tant pas, en donnant elle-marne l'exemple, ~ pr6coniser la suppression du voile pour ics femmes. 

 Le Bab a elk r~ussirent ~t convaincre, ~ l'~poque, des dizaines de milliers de Persans et le shah de Perse les emprisonna l'un et l'autre, ainsi que Ia plupart de leurs partisans. Le Bab fut pendu. Sa belle collaboratrice fat 6trangi6e dans sa prison. Leurs disciples furent exil6s ~t Saint-Jean-d'Acre, devenue, temple du C(Bah~;fsme~~ C'est ainsi que j'ai visit6 la maison du successeur du Bib, Baha'u'llah, transform6e aujourd'hui en temple du t~Ba1~a~f sine" C'est ainsi que s'intitule cette religion, qui est plut6t une doctrine philosophique, car die ne comporte ni culte d6fini, ni surtout de clerg6. Les pr&tres, diserit les Bah6istes, sont tent6s de fausser, dans un but de lucre, 1'iddalisme d6sint~ress6 des cr6ateurs de religions. 

 Baha'u'llah, ic principal des trois proph-~tes, rdpandit sa doctrine non seulernent en Orient, mais dans beaucoup de pars d'Europe, et surtout aux Exats-Unis oii son influence fin telle que le nombre des Ba1i~iYstes attient aujourd'hui plusieurs millions. II fut pers6-cut6 par ics Perses et mourut en exil. 

 Son his, tAbdu'1-Bah4, lui succ6da et formula, d'apr~s les principes de son pare, la doctrine dconornique du BaUYsme; elle in-dique dique une prescience 6tonnante des 6Wne-ments  qui se sont d6roulds depuis: 'a guerre d'abord, la crise ensuite. Ti mourut peu apr~s la guerre, ayant vu la r6alisation de la premi~re partie de ses proph6ties. 

    L'originalit6 du Bahiisme  

 est de chercher ~ faire passer dans le domaine pratique, et plus particuli&ement dans le domaine social, les principes essentiels du judaisme, du ca-tholicisrne et de l'islarnisme, en les combi-nant  et en ics adaptant aux besoins de notre 4oque. 

 Le BaMisme proclame que les rapports sociaux deviennent fatalement impossibles dans une soci6t6 oii 1'id6alisrne individuel ne donne pas une base certaine aux engagements qui lient les hommes entre eux. 

 L'individu se sent de pius en pius isol6 au milieu d'une jungle sociale qui menace, ~ beaucoup d'6gards, son bien — &tre et sa curit6. La bonne volont6 et 1'honn~tet4 ne produisant plus dans sa vie et dans son travail  le r6sultat qu'il attend, tendent ~ perdre pour lui toute valeur pratique. De h nais —  sent, selon les caract~res, 1'indiff6rence et le ddcouragement, ou 1'audace, le manque de scruples qui tendent ~ se procurer par tous les moyens, m6me les plus r6pr6hensibles, les bdn6fices mat6riels n6cessaires ~ 1'exist-ence. 

 La sockt6, n'6tant plus soumise ~ aucum contrOle, ni politique ni moral, devient un vaisseau sans gouvernail oii personne ne peut plus rien pr~voir et qui est sujet ~t des crises de plus en plus fr6quentes et de plus en plus violentes. L'6poque actuelle, d6clarent les prophtes persans, marque Ia fin d'une civiL-sation  qui ne sert plus les int6rats de 1'hu —  manit& Elk aboutit ~t la faillite compkte des institutions morales et matdrielles destindes ~ assurer le bien-&re et Ia s6curit6 des hommes, c'est-~i-dire l'ttat, lttglise, le 

Commerce et I'Jndustrie.   

 Le principe fondamental d'oii pea venir le salut de Ia civilisation engag6e dans des vojes qui conduisent ~ sa destruction est Ia solidarit6 des nations et des races. Car l'interp6n6tration des peuples est devenue telle qu'il leur est impossible de trouver isok —  ment Ia voic de la prospdrit6.

  ne sont pas, les 6v6nements l'ont prouv6, de simples j6r6rniades. II reste ~ examiner comment,  partant de ces donn6es, qui ne sont que trop exactes, le BaMisme, conqu dans la Perse lointaine a si arri6r~e 2i P6poque, aboutit aux rn&mes conclusions que La plu —  part des 6conomistes modernes qui, dans les difThrents pays de civilisation occidentale, proclament qu'en dehors d'une collaboration internationale ii n'y a pas d'issue possible ~i La cnse actuelle entrainant tous le peuples mis&e toujours plus grande. 

 (From LES EtHos, Paris, France, September  27, 1933.) 

  Une religion tt6conomique~~ Les principes du Bah6Jsme, formul6s par son principal propkte, Baha'u'llah, peuvent paraitre s6rieusement compromis en un temps oii la fr6ndsie nationaliste, rdcemrnent ag-grav6e  de racisme, semble en doigner de pius en plus 1'application. 

 Toute La question est de savoir si ceux qui sont en faveur aujourd'hui, dans tant de pays, sont susceptibles de r6soudre le pro-bkme  non pas de la prosp6rit6, mais simple-ment du logement a de la f aim, dans les diff6rentes nations qui nient par leurs th~o-ries  et tons leurs actes la solidarit6 des peuples et des races. 

 Une nouvelle guerre mondiale sera sans doute n6cessaire pour que 1'humanit6, qui n'a pas encore compris Ia le9on de 1914, se rende enfin compte que les solutions de violence et de conqu&te ne peuvent engendrer que la ruine g6n6rale, sans profit pour aucun des bellig6rants. 

 Quoi qu'il en soft, les principales pens6es &zonomiques de Baha'u'llah, telles qu'elles ont 6t6 formul6es ii y a un demisi6cle, prou-vent  que Ia sagesse et le simple bon sens ont cela de commun avec les 6crevisses, c'est qu'il leur arrive fr6quemrnent de marcher a reculons. 

 Voici les principaux pr&eptes de ce moderne Marc-Aurele: tcL~6vo1ution hurnaine se divise en cycles organiques, correspondant ~t la dur6e d'une religion, laquelle est d'environ un millier d'ann6es. 

 Un cycle social nouveau commence  toutes les fob qu'apparait un proph~te dont 1'influence et les enseignernents renou-vellent la vie intdrieure de 1'homme et font d6ferler ~t travers le monde une nouvelle vague de progr~s. 

 ccchaque nouveau cycle d6truit les croy-ances et les institutions us#es du cycle pr6c6-dent  et fonde sur d'autres croyances, en 6troite conformit6, celles-h, avec les besoins actuels de 1'humanit~, une civilisation nou-velle. 

 ctL~influence de chaque proph&e s'est, dans le pass6, limit6e ~i une race ou une religion, en raison de 1'isolement g~ographique des r6gions et des races, maTh le si&le dans lequel nous entrons n6cessite la cr6ation d'un ordre organique s'6tendant au monde entier. 

 Si le vieji esprit de tribu persiste, Ia science d6t-ruira  le monde, ses forces destructrices ne pouvant &re contr6l6es que par une hu-rnanit6 unie travaillant pour Ja prosptrit6 et le bien commun. 

 t>La loi de la lutte pour Ia vie n'existe plus pour 1'homme cks qu'il devient conscient de ses pouvoirs spirituels a moraux. 

 Elle est alors remplac~e par La loi plus haute de la coop&ration. Sous cette loi, 1'individu jouira d'un statut beaucoup plus large que celui qui est accord6 aux citoyens passifs du corps politique actuel. L'administration publique passera des mains de partisans politiques qui communiste plus ou moms th6orique, man d'hommes capables de considfter une charge publique comme une mission sacree. 

 (CLa stabilit6 6conomique ne d6pend pas de 1'application de tel plan socialiste on. communiste plus ou moThs th6orique, mais du sentiment de la solidarit6 morale qui unit tous les hommes et de cette conception que les richesses ne sont pas Ia fin de la vie, mais seulement un moyen de vivre. 

 ttL'important n'est pas en une aveugle soumission g6n6rale ~ tel syst~me politique, ~ tel r4lement, qui ont pour effet de sup-primer  chez 1'individu tout sentiment de responsibilit6 morale, mais en un esprit d'entr'aide et de coop6ration. Ni le principe d6mocratique, ni Ic principe aristocratique ne peuvent fournir s6par6ment $t Ia soci6t~ une base solide. La democratic est impuis —  sante contre les querelles intestines et 1'aris —  tocratie ne subsiste que par La guerre. 

 Une combinaison des deux principes est done n6cessaire.

 CCEfl cette p~riode de transition entre le vieji ~ge de la concurrence et J'&e nouvelle de Ia coop6ration, Ia vie nThrne de 1'huma-nit6  est en p6rii. Les ambitions nationalistes, la lutte des classes, la peur a les convoitises 6conomiques sont autant de forces qui poussent ~ une nouvelle guerre internation-ale. 

Tous les Gouvernements     

 du monde doivent soutenir et organiser tine assembl6e dont les membres sojent ins par 1'dite des nations. 

 Ceux-ci devront metvre au point, au-dessus des 6goismes particuliers, le nouveau  statut 6conomique du monde en dehors duquel tous les pays, mali surtout PEurope, seront conduits aux pires catastrophes." 

 Abdu'l-Baha, son successeur, reprenant La doctrine de son pare, concluait dans un dis-cours  prononc6 ~ New-York en 1912: cCLa civilisation mat&ielle a atteint, en Occident, le plus baa degr6 de son d6velop-pernent. 

 Mais c'est en Orient qu'a a pris naissance et que s' est £velopp6e Lx civilisation  spirituelle. 

 Un lien s'dtablira entre ces deux forces, a leur union est la condition de 1'imrnense progr~s qui doit ~tre ac-compli. 

 "Hors de lii, la s6curit6 et la confiance feront de plus en plus d6faut, les luttes et ics dissensions s'accroitront de jour en jour et ies divergences entre nations s'accentue-ront davantage. Les pays augmenteront constamment leurs armements; La guerre, puis la certitude d'une autre guerre mondiale angoisseront de plus en pius les esprits. L'unit6 du genre humain est ic premier fondement de toutes les vertus." 

    Ainsi parla Abdu'l-Baha   

 en 1912, et tout se passa comme ii 1'avait pr6dit. 

 MaTh ces paroles n'ont pas vieilli; cues pourraient, sans le moindre changement, ftre r6p&6es en 1933. Aujourd'hui, cornme ii y a vingt ans, Ia menace de Ia guerre est de nouveau suspendue au-dessus de nos t6tes et les causes de haines et de conflits s'accumu-lent ~t tel point que, s'il existe vraiment un flux et un reflux des iddes, on pea presque conclure, avec une certaine dose d'opti-misme,  que nous n'avons jamais 6t6 si pr~s de renir aux id6es de coop&ation qui, seules, peuvent nous sauver.

  The philosophy of Baha'u'llah deserves the best thought we can give it. I am returning  the book so that other blind people who have more leisure than myself may be ccshown a ray of Divinity" and their hearts be "bathed in an inundation of eternal love." 

 I take this opportunity to thank you for your kind thought of me, and for the inspiration  which even the most cursory reading  of Baha'u'llah's life cannot fail to impart. 

 What nobler theme than the (cgood of the world and the happiness of the nations"  can occupy our lives? The message of universal peace will surely prevail. It is useless to combine or conspire against an idea which has in it potency to create a new earth and a new heaven and to quicken human beings with a holy passion of service.

Taken together, they form an unanswerable argument and plea for the only way that the world can be made over. It we could put into effect this program, we should indeed  have a new world order. 

 "The morals of humanity must undergo change. New remedy and solution for human  problems must be adopted. Human intellects themselves must change and be subject to the universal reformation."

 I have read the pamphlet on the "New World Order" by Shoghi Effendi. It is an eloquent expression of the doctrines which I have always associated with the Baha'i Movement and I would like to express my great sympathy with the aspirations towards world unity which underlie his teaching. 

  B~ PROF. DR. V. LESNY The conditions are so changed now, since the technique of the present time has de stroyed the barriers between nations, that the world needs a uniting force, a kind of super-religion. 

 I think Bahi'ism could develop  to such a kind of religion. I am quite convinced of it, so far as I know the Teachings of Baha'u'llah      There are modern saviors and Baha'u'llah is a Savior of the twentieth century. 

 Everything must be done on a democratic basis, there must be international brotherhood. We must learn to have confidence in ourselves and then in others. One way to learn this is through inner spiritual education, and a way to attain such an education may be through 

BaM'isrn.                  

  I am still of the opinion that I had four years ago that the Baha'i Movement can form the best basis for international goodwill, and that Baha'u'llah Himself is the Creator of an eternal bond between the East and the West. 

 The Baha'i Teaching  is a living religion, a Living philosophy.

  One reason I hail with thanksgiving the interpretation of religion known as the Baha'i Faith and feel so deep a kinship with its followers is that I recognize in its Revelation  an outreach of the Divine to stumbling  humanity; a veritable thrust from the radiant Center of 

Life.                     

 Every follower of this faith that I have ever met impressed me as a living witness to the glory at the heart of this universe. Each one seemed filled with a splendor of spirit so great that it overflowed all boundaries  and poured itself out upon the world here in this moment of time, by some concentrated act of love toward another hu —  man being.

  The lovely peace of Carmel, which still attracts mystics of different faiths, dominates  Haifa. On its summit are the Druses in their two villages; at its feet the German Templars, whose avenue leads up to the now large and beautiful terraced property of the Persian Baha'is on the mountainside. Here the tombs of the Bib and of tAbdu'1-Bah6.,  set in a fair garden, are a place of international pilgrimage. On Sundays and holidays the citizens of Haifa of all faiths come for rest and recreation where lie the bones of that young prophet of Shiriz who nearly a hundred years ago preached that all men are one and all the great religions true, and foretold the coming equality of men and women and the birth of the first League of Nations. 

  B~ PROF. DR. JAN RYPKA The Baha'is of Inn are resolutely firm in their religion. Their firmness does not have its roots in ignorance. The frinian inborn character causes them to see things somewhat too great, slightly exaggerated, and their dissensions with the ruling Islim make them a little bitter towards it. Everything else in their characters is accounted for as due to their Teachings; they are wonderfully ready to help and happy to sacrifice. 

 rifice. Faithfully they fulfill their office and professional duties. 

 Long ago they already solved the problem of the Eastern woman; their children are carefully educated.  They are sometimes reproached for their lack of patriotism. Certainly, as specifically  frinian as the ShEila Faith, the Baha'i Faith can never become; but the Baha'i 

Religion like Christianity

 does not preclude the love of one's fatherland. 

 Are the Europeans not sufficiently patriotic! According to my experiences, the Baha'is in that respect, are very unjustly criticized by their Muhammadan brothers. 

 During the centuries the Shicih Religion has developed a deep national tradition; with this the universal Baha'i Faith will have a bard battle. Nevertheless, the lack of so great numbers is richly recompensed by the fervor  and the inner spirit of the IrAnian 

Ba-h?i  Community. The    

 Baha'i world community will educate characters which will appear well worthy of emulation by people of other Faiths, yes, even by the world of those now enemies of the Baha'i Cause. 

 The experience acquired in the West, for me was fully verified also in the I r~nian Orient. The Baha'i Faith is undoubtedly an immense cultural value. 

 Could all those men whose high morality I admired and still admire have reached the same heights oniy in an another way, without it? No, never! Is it bas~d only on the novelty of the Teachings, and in the freshness of its closest followers?

  I have followed it (the Baha'i Cause) with deep interest every since my trip to London to the First Races Congress in July, 1911, when I heard for the first time of the Baha'i Movement and its summary of the principles for peace. 

 I followed it during the war and after the war. 

 The Baha'i Teaching is one of the spiritual forces now absolutely necessary to put the spirit first in this battle against material forces. The Baha Teaching is one of the great instruments for the final victory of the spirit and of humanity.

         A BAHA'I PIONEER OF EAST AND WEST — 
           DOCTOR SUSAN I. MOODY (THE HAND
               MAID OF THE MOST HIGH)
                    Amatu'1-Atl4

                 B~ JESSIE E. REVELL

  IN reality," says tAbdu'1-Bahi, "faith embodies three degrees: to confess with the tongue; to believe in the heart; to give evidence  in our actions." 

 In writing a brief account of the life of Dr. Susan I. Moody the real faith, as quoted here, is outstanding. 

 She was born November 20, 1851 in Amsterdam, 

New York, of Scotch-Cove-nanter 

 parents. Here she received the usual schooling and orthodox religious training of the CCbt~~ families of the day. After graduating from Amsterdam Academy, she taught school, later entered the 'Women's Medical 

College in New York City.  

 After her parents passed away, she made her home with her brother in Chicago where she studied music. 

 Still later, Dr. Moody studied painting and sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, then for three years in the Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, then under the great painter Chase, in New York and finally, in the art schools and studios of Paris, but she was not, however,  to make art her life work for instead of following the professional art career, for which she was well qualified, she finally yielded to the constantly increasing urge which she felt and concluded her study of medicine, graduating from a Chicago medical  college. 

 During those early days of her life in Chicago, she met friends who were attending  the first classes formed for the study of the Baha'i Revelation, which classes she joined but did not become a confirmed be —  liever until 1903, after making an intensive  study of the teachings with Mrs. Isabella D. Brittingliam, for the privilege of whose teaching Dr. Moody was always exceedingly grateful. 

     The first Baha Sunday     

 School in Chicago was conducted by Dr. Moody and later she was one of the group of Baha sisters who traveled up and down the outskirts of Chicago's north side in search of the best location for the now famous Baha'i Temple in Wilrnerte, Illinois. 

 About 1908 a party of American Baha traveled to Idn to visit the Baha'is in that land, and while there some Iranian doctors asked if it would be possible to induce an American woman doctor to come to Tihdn, Inn, to live, for the purpose of caring for the women of IrAn who at that time were so deprived of skilled medical care. Stopping  in tAkk~, Palestine, on their return, the Americans communicated this wish to tAbdu'1-BahS who asked them if they knew of such a doctor. 

 The name of Dr. Moody was presented, and she received word without  delay from tAbdu'1 — Baha telling her she had been chosen for this great medical work in I ran. "I knew then," Dr. Moody often remarked, "why I had felt the urge so strongly to study medicine; I was obliged to study medicine in order to come to Inn." When the call came from cAbd~1Bh~ she proceeded immediately on her journey. 

 Enroute to Iran, Dr. Moody stopped in the Holy Land to see tAbdu'1-Ba1A and receive  from Him the necessary instructions and encouragement for the work ahead of her. At the time of parting He said, "You will need patience." 

 He also further stated that He was sending her to Iran and whether living or dead He would always 483

  Dr. Susan I. Moody, 18511934.

  be with her. During that visit with ~Ab du'1-BahA, Dr. Moody made a vow which was, "All that I am and have, and all that I hope to be and have, I dedicate to Thee, 0     God." She also said that those three days in the Holy Land with the Master, tAbdu~1~Bah~, were all her life. 

 Dr. Moody arrived in Tilirin November 26, 1909. tAbdu~1BahA mentioned to some pilgrims the great love with which the Baha'i of IrAn had greeted Dr. Moody when she arrived in Inn, saying that between Enzeli, on the Caspian Sea, and Tihrin there were nineteen relay stations and at sixteen of these there were Baha'is gathered to greet the western Baha'i. Soon after her arrival a reception was given to her and Dr. Moody then knew she had an eternal home in the hearts of these dear friends. 

 During her fifteen years of service to the Cause in inn, many were her difficulties and hardships but she had an inflexible determination to accomplish what cAbdu~1~ Baha wished her to do. 

 Often she prayed for the supreme patience  which Abdu'l-Baha had prescribed. She soon became fluent in the Ir~nian language. 

 Frequent were her letters to America,  explaining her work, enclosing photographs and telling of the lack of freedom and education of the IrAnian women, of the custom of wearing the veil, etc., of the Baha'i work of establishing a hospital, a girl's school and a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar there. In a Tihr~n newspaper in 1910 appeared the following: "DOCTOR MOODY — AMERICAN LADY —  not only does she know medicine, but also gynecology, obstetrics and women's diseases. 

 Her good qualities and kind attributes,  her love for her Persian oriental sisters, are all equal. Every day from morning  till noon she is in her office, No. 10 Avenue  Aladauleli, receiving her patients for consultation, examination and treatment, ex

  cepting Friday and Sunday afternoons, when she goes to the Hospital Sehat (Hospital of Health), where she meets the patients of the higher and wealthier class. 

 ~ give the utmost thanks and gratitude  to such a noble woman, to such a respected  person, whose presence here is a great privilege to the country of Persia. On account of the great care of this blessed person, the sick of all nationalities, Moslem, at al., become well. We beg of God to keep this blessed and respected person with us. Aside from her medical work, there was ever present in her mind the most important  question of the education of girls. Often she would say, ttMy heart aches for the neglected ones." She found that many of the Baha'i men were in full sympathy with her views and through Baha'i cooperation  and consultation a girl's school was started with an attendance of thirty pupils. 

 It has now an enrollment of several  hundred and is known as the Tarbiyat School for Girls. Someone has declared it to be "the greatest among all the schools in Tihdn." One of the activities most dear to the heart of Dr. Moody was the raising of funds for an additional building. She wished this fund to be known as the 

CtK                        

 pes Memorial Fund" in memory of Miss Lillian Kappes, the first American Baha'i teacher who died in tr6n after giving nine years of untiring service to the School. 

 Dr. Moody not oniy started the Tarbiyat School for the secular education of girls, she also founded the Baha study classes for girls and herself visited these classes every Friday.  These study classes were managed by trained teachers and in these classes many who started years ago in the first course are now teaching others. 

 Dr. Moody was loved and honored by thousands of people in her life time, among them being Major Robert W. Imbrie, who offered protection to the Baha and who suffered martyrdom by fanatical Muluiam-madans. 

 During the epidemic of influenza, the famine and a variety of dreadful conditions,  Dr. Moody wrote to America, ctoh what a mercy that we are alive and awakened  and trying to serve in the Kingdom of Abhi." The secret of Dr. Moody's noble and self-sacrificing life was the fact that it was built on the solid foundation of the Word of God. She had a keen spiritual perception, a pure and undefiled conception of the Baha'i teachings, and a desire to render instant obedience. 

 She was humble, selfless, and her sense of justice was outstanding. 

 After hfteen years of unique service in Pin, Dr. Moody returned to America until conditions in Tihrin would improve and enable her to resume her work. Accompanied by Miss Elizabeth H. Stewart she made a visit in Haifa and there the writer joined them. Dr. Moody was the first of the four American Baha'i women to go to I r~n and survived the longest. 

 Dr. Moody, Miss Stewart and the writer arrived in New York City in January, 1925, where the Baha'is had arranged a reception at the Hotel NValdorf Astoria. Calmly, yet with the dramatic emphasis which always surrounds one who has actually  participated in stirring events, Dr. Moody related her experiences in Tilirin. After this reception she remarked to the writer, "To return to America and receive such love from the friends, is worth more than any sacrifice one could make." 

 That the remarkable work of Dr. Susan I. Moody in Tihrin had made her a public figure in this country was well illustrated by extensive articles which appeared in the press. 

 While in Oakland, California, she took a short trip in an aeroplane and the press published her picture with her pilot and an article in part as follows: "Accord-ing  to Dr. Moody, who contrasts her entry into Tihrin, the capitol of IrAn, in a coach and four where she went to spread the gospel of hygiene to the Muijammadan women, and her exodus in a "flivver" of doubtful vintage twenty years later, she sees no reason why aerial transportation should hold any fears for the women of today." 

 During her stay in America from January,  1925, to November, 1928, Dr. Moody was interesting friends to help with the work she, together with the Tihdn friends, expected to continue on her return to I ran, the 

Kappes Memorial School.    

 She was a member of the Revell household in Phila

  deiphia for about a year and during that time although she was then past 75 years of age, yet young in spirit and progressive and active, she studied Esperanto with a class. 

 In 1928, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i Cause, sent the following in —  structions to Dr. Moody: "I pray that you may soon in the company of a capable and devoted American coworker, resume your historic labors for our beloved Cause in Tihr~n." Following this suggestion on November 17, 1928, Dr. Moody, then 77 years of age, left for Iran, accompanied by Miss Adelaide Sharp of San Francisco, California, who volunteered her services at the Tarbi-yat  School in Tihr6n. To Dr. Moody's historic  career in Tihdn was now to be added the final chapter of complete consecration to Baha'i service. They conferred with Shoghi Effendi in Haifa en route to tr~n. Dr. Moody, named by tAbclu'1-Bahi "Am tu'1 Al"' which means the handmaid of the Most High, wrote of the welcome in Tihr&n in part as follows: "The friends came singly, in groups, committees, assemblies,  more than seven hundred the first week, and still we are greeting many new and old friends, both women and men. Words fail to express the joy of our ~home-coming.' 

 I wish you might have seen how that love overflowed in gifts, potted vines, plants, flowers, silver vases, confectionery, sweets of all kinds. Do you wonder why the two Americans were overwhelmed?" After her return to TihrAn, due to age, her health gradually weakened but she continually  worked for the Kappes Memorial School, and the friends called on her constantly.  At the end of her life when asked for some statement from her regarding her service to keep for posterity, Dr. Moody said, "Let it go, let it pass into the Infinite." 

 Shoghi Effendi cabled to America as follows: "Passing dearly beloved 

Susan Moody deprives Baha'i

 world (of the) far-famed pioneer who, through her indomitable spirit, ceaseless services, earned unique distinction. (She) forged first link in (the) chain uniting (the) spiritual destinies (of the) cradle of our faith (i.e., Persia) and (the) community (of its) stalwart defenders in (the) great American RepubLic. (I am) instructing Persia rear monument perpetuating memory (of) her noble mission.

 Her funeral was attended by hundreds of Baha'i friends. Scores of school girls, with flowers in hand walked in procession through the cit3~ for at least one mile to Gulast6n-i — Javid (Perennial Garden), the burying ground of the Baha'is. 

 Baha'u'llah in one of His Tablets says: "Th soul that hath remained faithful to the Cause of God and stood unwaveringly firm in His path shall, after his ascension, be possessed of such power that all the worlds which the Almighty hath created can benefit through him."

  With the passing of our dearly beloved Baha'i brother, Blooper Harris, from this phenomenal world to the invisible eternal realm, the worldwide Baha'i Community sustained the loss of one more of those faithful  and devoted souls who gave the best years of their lives to the promotion and establishment of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the West and in the East. 

    William Hooper Harris     

 was born in New York City, December 14, 1866. All his early years, however, were spent in Nashville, Tenn. After finishing High School, financial difficulties at home precluded  his intended study of law at College. 

 He therefore worked by day, studied law at night and was admitted to the bar in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1893. In 1887, he married 

Sarah Gertrude Rawis      

 of Birmingham and in 1894, they came to New York City to live, where he became an expert court reporter, doing work of unusually high quality till the very day of his death. 

 In New York City, in 1899, his wife, ever persistent in her desire and search for Truth, was told, by Mrs. Archie Fisk, of the

Baha Faith and Mrs. Harris

 soon realized it to be the object of her search. Hooper Harris accompanied her to hear the Baha'i Message and ere long he, too, realized the Light and Bounty of the Revelation of Thereupon he became a faithful and devoted student of the Baha'i Revelation and of all the previous Revelations of Truth to mankind, especially those parts of the various Books which prophesied this Great Day of Light. 

 His continuous study and untiring  efforts to know the Truth spiritually as well as mentally proved to be a timely preparation which enabled him to answer the call of 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1906 for an American to go to India to teach the Cause. On November 10, 1906, Mr. Harris, accompanied  by Harlan Ober of Beverly, Mass., 

 left New York City for tAkk5 to receive the blessing and instructions from cAbdu~1BahA In answer to Mr. Harris' request for specific instructions as to how to teach in India, tAbdu~1~Bahi~s oniy reply was, CcFace the people with a smile on your face and the love of God in your heart and rely wholly upon the 

Holy Spirit." tAbdu~1~ Baha

 sent with Mr. Harris and Mr. Ober, as companions and teachers, two IrAnian teachers neither of whom could speak English.  One was Janabi Ibn Abbar, an elderly I r6~nian who had suffered for years in prison and in chains for his Faith, the other Mirza Mahmnid, a young man whom we knew later when he came to 

America with Abdu'l-Baha 
in 1912.                  

 From the time of the first address given aboard the ship by request of the Captain, just before teaching Naples, Mr. Harris was engaged continuously, day by day, for a period of seven months, in promulgating the Faith. The letters which he sent from the East to the friends in America form a large volume and give most vivid descrip

  tions of his activities in Bombay, Poona, Lahore, Calcutta, Rangoon and 

Mandalay.                  

 He was privileged to address large audiences  of the 

Brama Somaj and Arya       
Somaj movements, Theosophici
Societies, The National   
Association of Indian      
Women, and a Conference    

 of Religions held at Lahore. He was interviewed by mary interested seekers individually. He wrote a series of six articles upon the Faith for the Zoroastrian daily newspaper and other articles for the "Bombay New Thought Magazine" and the "V of 

India."                    

 His work in India was well done and time alone will reveal the harvest from the seeds planted so carefully and prayerfully in the fertile soil of India. 

 Mr. Harris returned to New York in 1907 and continued ceaselessly to set forth the teachings, stressing the logical fulfillment of the successive Covenants of God and bearing witness to the inspiration, glory, and responsibilities of living in this Day of fulfillment. 

 His constant and efl'icient work in teaching  caused him to be appointed by the National Spiritual 

Assembly as Chairman       

 of the National Teaching Committee of the Northeastern States, and the Conventions and Conferences arranged by him proved a great benefit to those privileged to attend. 

 He served as a faithful, conscientious and active member of the New York Spiritual Assembly for all but a few scattered years from 1901 till his death on July 27, 1934, and the present Spiritual Assembly feels deeply the loss of his sincere and disinterested  counsel. 

 At one time, in the early years of the Cause in America, the Harris home served as headquarters for the c~Board of Counsel"; in fact, his home was open at all times to the friends. Man}~ of the teachers of Pin sent to America by cAbdu~1~BaM were his guests. Mr. and Mrs. Harris were rejoiced to have cAbdu~1~Bah4 Himself spend an afternoon and night in their home in 1912. 

 The many Tablets which Hooper Harris received from Abdu'l-Baha  now preserved in the National Archives in Chicago — were a constant stimulant toward ever greater effort to serve. 

 Hooper Harris' life of loving devotion to the Cause can be measured oniy by the All-Seeing 

Eye of God Himself. We     

 see and know but a few of the traces of his spirit; Baha'u'llah knows the full record. 

 Our prayer is that Baha'u'llah may eternally  shower His love and bounty upon our beloved brother in the Faith, Hooper Harris. 

 From a letter received by Mrs. Harris from Shoghi 

Effendi, dated September   

 20, 1934, the following excerpt is quoted: "His passing in these early days of the formative period of our Faith is, indeed, a severe loss not oniy to his friends and relatives but also and mainly to all the American followers of the Movement who had found in his person not only a real and sincere fellow-believer  but also an active and capable exponent  of the teachings and principles of the Cause." From the same letter, the postscript written by the Guardian: !CT irreparable  loss of your very dear husband has removed a distinguished figure from the community of the American believers and inflicted a sev&e blow to its best interests. The share he has had in lending fresh impetus  to the teaching activities of its members, the contributions he has made to the advancement of its institutions, the example he has set by his single-mindedness, his eloquent  presentation of the essentials of God's Faith and his exemplary devotion to its cause will long be remembered after him. He was indeed one of the leading apostles of 

Baha'u'llah."

  The friends of the New York Assembly were deeply grieved to read the following despatch from London to "The New York Times" of the passing of Harry Houston Romer on April 13, 1935. 

 ccOI1 April 13, 1935, Harry Houston Romer, member of the Associated Press, domestic and foreign staffs, died today of heart disease, aged 64 years. A native of Westchester County, N. Y., Mr. Romer was a member of an old American family. During  the war he held important posts in the news organization. 

He became Chief Foreign   

 News Editor and later was placed in charge of the Berlin Bureau. Subsequently

  he was a member of the London Staff where his experience and background in United States and international affairs aided him in handling the swiftly moving events of the postwar era. Mr. Romer carried on his duties through the present European crisis until physicians ordered him to bed two weeks ago. Surviving him are his widow and a son, Professor Alfred S. Romer, of Harvard 

University."              

 It was in 1922 that Mr. Romer became a member of the New York Community. 

 On April 21, 1924, Mr. Romer was elected to the Spiritual Assembly and after February 19, 1925, was its chairman. On April 21, 1925, he was again elected to the Spiritual Assembly and made chairman. On June 11, 1925, he was a delegate to the Convention at Greenacre. 

 It was the writer's happy privilege to be closely associated with Mr. Romer during the period of establishing the public meetings ings and lectures at the 

New York Center, at "The  

 Baha'i Congress," and at the Ethical Culture Society, etc. The program for this work at the Center was essentially planned for the purpose of presenting to the people a comprehensive outline of Baha'u'llah's great principles laid down for the New World Order and to study the most efficient propaganda for this work. 

 First Mr. Romer conceived the idea of publishing each week (Saturday) in the leading newspapers unique and attractive advertisements which included quotations from the words of Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha.  This was the first time such a thing ever had been done and it was found to be a most effective way to publish the "Word of God." See page 490 for an example. 

 The plan resulted in capacity audiences throughout the entire series. For two years Mr. Romer took the responsibility of adver

  tising and printing for this work, including Baha'i meetings on other platforms. 

 Mr. Romer's devoted and inspiring service never flagged; always his thought entertained  the broad, universal scope of Baha'u'llah's teachings and was the basic view —  point from which all activities emanated. His very presence of radiant cheer was a pervading influence at' all gatherings — a presence which banished all fears — strengthened our hope and faith in the power of Baha'u'llah to overcome all difficulties which might arise. It was a thrilling experience in that we were privileged to witness the ~tSun of Truth" dispersing all clouds. 

 No thought of self or personal advantage ever dimmed the light of his clear vision. Like all illumined souls he exhaled the fragrance  of humility. 

 He had but one all-embracing desire — the advancement of the Cause and the promulgation of its Teachings.  Nothing could depress his buoyant spirit or lessen the fervor of his yital efforts in this work. He had indeed caught a glimpse of the Glorious Splendor and it grew upon him as he witnessed the result of earnest  effort evolving steadily and increasingly as the months passed. We felt it to be a great appreciation when our dear departed brother, Mr. Hooper Harris, said, !tYou~ve established a great work and it will go on forever. 

 Mr. Romer was the only professional newspaper man in the Baha'i community and he spread the knowledge of the Baha'i Movement throughout the News Association with which he was connected, thus establishing  in the minds of many foreign editors the sense of the importance of the then little-known Baha Movement. It was largely through his efforts that much of the publicity was obtained at the time of CAb du'1-Bah&s passing. 

 He heralded the news to the press, and leading newspapers published reports which in some cases gave historical data of the Cause and an outline of tAbdu'1-BahA's visit to the United States. 

 We consider that Mr. Romer rendered signal service to the Cause in his association with the New York Assembly during a period  when it was emerging into a new phase of Baha'i activities after the passing of CAbd~1Bh~ His outstanding qualities were his straightforwardness, uncompromising loyalty to truth, keen perception, clear vision, simplicity and humility. With him "Word and deed alike one color bore." He lived and dwelt in the steadfastness of his shining faith. 

 Very kind in priyate life, natural and simple, with an unerring instinct for the finest and best, especially in music and lit —  erature, he attracted all around him by a benevolent equity and tenderness of soul. 

  It was in 1926, that Mr. and Mrs. Romer arrived in London, and at once became known to the friends. 

 The presence of these two sincere and earnest Baha'is has had an influence on the Cause that cannot be estimated  till the secrets of all hearts are disclosed.  Mr. Romer was prevented by his professional obligations from taking the active part in the work of the Movement, which his wife undertook so faithfully; but his influence was deeply felt. His sincerity and selflessness gave great value to his counsel,  and his simple faith was an inspiration to all who knew him. He was beloved for his kindly generous nature, and when he entered a gathering an added warmth and light seemed perceptible. He was always reluctant to speak in public, or to take a prominent part in meetings; but when he could be prevailed on to do so, his words carried great weight, for they were backed by a life lived on the purest Baha'i ideals. A young IrAnian was once heard to remark that they looked on him as the exemplar of what a Baha should be. In 1929 great efforts were made to give the Movement a

  better setting in London. 

 It was felt that a Center for work and meetings should be acquired; and a room at Walnmr House, Upper Regent Street, was rented. 

 Mr. Romer did good work on the Committee formed to bring this into operation. 

 Later, in 193334 he served on the London Spiritual 

Assembly, and Finance      

 committee; but the exactions of his profession gave him very little strength or leisure for other things, and it was his strong sense of Baha'i obligations that led him often to tax his strength unduly. 

 Though averse to public speaking, Mr. Romer was never backward in speaking of the faith that was in him, and in his daily life he found countless opportunities to speak of the Cause. 

 In matters of policy he always deprecated any tendency to rigidity or sectarianism; and his clear, direct vision always led him to a clear and logical conclusion, There was no compromise with truth as he saw it. It was with great grief that the friends heard of his sudden illness and that the doctors had ordered him to have complete rest. His brave cheerfulness had concealed from most of them how heavily the weight of business cares had pressed on him, undermining  his health. No one was prepared, however,  for the sudden call, ~Friend, go up higher." 

 His outward presence was quietly withdrawn,  without stress or undue suffering, but he was conscious to the last. 

 His earthly form rests in the beautiful cemetery at Harnpscead close to his last home. 

 A Baha'i Service was held in the Chapel there; and as the friends gathered round the grave, passages from the Hidden Words were recited. tt Son of Spirit, with the joyful tidings of light I hail thee. 

Rejoice! To the Court      

 of holiness I summon thee, abide therein that thou mayest live in peace for evermore," seemed to £11 the bearers with solemn joy, for truly they felt that his spirit was with his Lord, His lovable, kindly nature, his sensitive artistic soul, and above all his uncompromising straightness remain with a fragrant memory and inspiration, while we believe that he is called to work in a higher station in the presence of Baha'u'llah. 

HOWARD LtJXMORE CARPENTER  

  (1906193 3) Dr. Howard Carpenter became a Baha'i through conversations with Howard Mac-Nutt  when the latter was lecturing in California, and shortly afterward he matriculated at Stanford University, graduating from the Stanford 

Medical School in 1932. During

 his university years he attended Baha'i meetings at Stanford and in San Francisco, and served on the San Francisco Assembly in various capacities including that of Chairman. He was present at the sessions of the Geyserville Summer School, and was the first to build a cabin on land offered to Baha'is by John Bosch for that purpose. At Stanford he exemplified the Baha'i principle of race oneness — incidentally startling his university contemporaries by rooming with Yoshio Okumoto, a Japanese  fellow-student. 

     He married Mar4liyyih      

 Nabil in 1929, and in 1932 he and his wife left San Francisco for Vienna, where he rook a medical course, and afterward at the Guardian's direction traveled through Central Europe and the Balkans. 

 'With Martha Root in Vienna, Budapest and Belgrade, he then spent five weeks in Sofia, Bulgaria, assisting Miss Marion Jack, after which he stopped briefly in Saloniki and went on to Tirana, Albania, to visit Ref o Chapary. 

 He then left for Haifa, where be stayed three weeks on his way to Tihrin. 

 In IrAn, notwithstanding the efforts of the Assembly, he was prevented for more than one year from obtaining a medical license. 

 His health failed, and he was bedridden  for many months. At last his physical  condition improved, he resumed activities  as a member of the Unity of the East and West Committee, and the authorities granted him a license to practise medicine. At this time he was stricken with paralysis. He lay seven months in a hospital, after which Mr. and Mrs. Rahnmt 'AH'i invited him to their home, surrounding him with the same loving care which they had given Keith Ransom-Keller the year before. His doctors advised a return to the United States as his only hope for recovery; he braved the long journey across the desert

That hour is now come." — Ibid. Within the above quotations, one can perceive  the heavenly skies that bounded the life history of Dr. Edward C. Getsinger. 

 To his many friends, who recall the spirit of Dr. Getsinger's interests and Faith, both the problems that attracted his attention and the final success of his life are therein clear and evident. 

 Dr. Getsinger was born at midnight, January 78, 1866, in the town of Franken-muth,  Saginaw County, Michigan. He died in Hollywood, California, March 12, 1935. The name of his parents is given as Goet-singer  or Goetzingcr, but he, himself, always wrote his name as Getsinger. 

 At the early age of seven, the child, Edward, had left the home of his parents and disappeared into a neighboring town. Five years were to elapse before he was again seen by his parents; for in this town he had been taken into the home of a former professor  of 

Heidelberg University      

 and there he contentedly remained. At this early age he is fascinated by the mystery of the luminous bodies in stellar spaces, and often climbs to the roof to gaze at the illimitable heavens. 

 At a later date he feels himself a disciple of Hahnemann, who passed away in 1843, and takes to reading medicine with such success that, at 22, he is admitted to practice  in the state of Michigan, having served the required year in a hospitaL, and is classed as a homeopath. 

 But with Dr. Getsinger, the practice of medicine as the object of his life, beautiful and important as this profession is, when united with the Love of God, soon gave way to the more preponderant appeal which the stars in their orbits exerted in attracting his interest. His interpretation of the science of celestial mechanics was to remain to him a fascinating branch of the great scientific tree of astronomy. 

 In the year 1893, Dr. Getsinger is found at Chicago, as he writes: CCw appointed one of the state's (Michigan) delegates to World's Congress of 

Scientists, Chicago 'World's

 Fair." And it was at this Fair, in another World's Congress, the ~~Wor1d's Congress of Religions," that the Baha'i Faith, the greatest of all the interests that was later to gain and hold the attention of Dr. Getsinger, was first mentioned in America. 

 As its distinguished Guardian Shoghi Effendi has written: "Of pomp and circumstance, of any manifestations of public rejoicing, or of popular applause, there was none to greet this first intimation to America'  s citizens of the existence and purpose of the Revelation proclaimed by Baha'u'llah. Nor did he who was its chosen instrument profess himself a believer in the indwelling potency of the tidings he conveyed, or suspect  the magnitude of the forces which so cursory a mention was destined to release." 

 Whether, or not, "the magnitude of the forces" released by the mention ccof the Revelation proclaimed by Baha'u'llah" at this great World's Fair in Chicago in 11893 had, in some way not as yet understood, an effect upon Dr. Getsinger, certain it is that Thornton Chase, confirmed by the Center of its Covenant, cAbdu~1~Bahd, as "the first Baha'i in America," heard of the Baha'i Faith within a year (June 5, 1894), and Dr. Getsinger is listed as certifying to his wish to be counted a believer in the Baha Cause on October 27, 1897. (At this time the early believers considered the giving of the Greatest Name as the symbol of acceptance.) 

 In his own chronology of events, Dr. Get-singer is silent as to the years after the Fair in 1893, until the year 1896. 
Dr. Getsinger writes:      

"It (the Baha'i Faith)     

 was first brought to my attention in Chicago in 1896, and after hearing the Message as delivered to me by a Syrian, I returned to my home in Detroit, Michigan, and there studied the matter for months in absolute fairness to truth." By 1897, he had accepted the Reve

IN MEMORIAM                  495

  lation of Baha'u'llah. And, also, in 1897, he married Lua A. Moore. 

     Again quoting Dr. Getsinger:
~~Mrs. (Phoebe) Hearst     

 read of me in the newspapers in 1897, and called me to her Hacienda.  She was regent of the University of California gave her the Message." (Of the Baha Faith.) In response to this call Dr. and Lua GetAnger went to California together, and not many months elapsed before  Mrs. Hearst expressed the wish to Visit tAbdu'1-Bah~ in His home in Akka, the Prison City of Palestine. 

 She invited Lua and Dr. Getsinger to be her guests on that trip. Late in the year 1898, they all departed for the Holy Land, via Paris, France. 

 To quote from the letter of an early believer: "Sh (Mrs. Hearst) took them to tAkkA and they were the very first pilgrims to the Prison City, from 

America.                  

 ttMrs. Hearst and her guests went first to her home in Paris, France; she took her colored  butler from there to cAkkA, and the Master, as you probably know, was very loving and kind to Robert." 

 From the account of still another early believer, it is ascertained that Mrs. Hearst remained for a time in Paris, France, sending Dr. and Lua Getsinger ahead of her to Akka, where she joined them later. 

 In Lu's written account of this first pilgrimage of Americans to the (cMost Great Prison" city of tAkk~i, Palestine, the statement is made that she and Dr. Getsinger arrived in Haifa, Palestine, Thursday, December 8, 1898, about 10:30 P.M. The day after the next day, of December 10, 1898, in the morning, they left Haifa, and in a short time they had arrived at CAkki passed through its gate and had gone directly to the home of tAbdu'1-Bahi. 
They then met 'Abdu'l-Baha.

   Dr. Getsinger writes: "When

 I first saw tAbbAs Effendi (tAbdu'1 — Bah~) the Servant of Baha, at tAkk4, in spite of my former belief I still had enough spiritual perception with (in) my living Tomb to see at once, a holy man, a divine character, a most humble yet profound spirit and intellect, a heart as great as human weakness, a mercy as wide as justice, a soul that I could not comprehend and at that moment I consecrated my life and all to the principles for which He stands in the world." 

 According to his own account, before becoming assured of the existence of God because of the clear logic in the Baha'i Faith, Dr. Getsinger had been an atheist. This statement he makes in a lecture written by him and from which he read in 1902, and he goes on to ask his audience, reading from the same lecture, ccWhat power or glory of any belief can bring atheists back when once they turn from hope? Only the sensible truth, rational religion, scientific exposition, clear interpretation of symbolic prophecy as given by the Baha'is can accomplish this." 

 An old friend of flr. Getsinger writes of him: "His early writings show him to have been a student. And even then he warred upon worldliness, ambition, pride and strife. 

 He was not an egoist, for he did not regard self-development and selfsatisfaction as the supreme end of cx-istence. 

 As one sympathetically reviews Dr. Get-singer's life, its two strong foundations are his zealous attention to research along scientific lines, and his, but for a short interval, continuous, unfailing service to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Dr. Getsinger's aim, and historians of the Faith will probably record these matters in detail, was the search for additional truths that seemed unquestionably related to the central truth of all truths to him, the great Revelation of Baha'u'llah. 

 Those in position to know state that he left volumes of manuscripts completed oniy three or four days before his death, of research into the ancient truths of the Old Testament and in relation to his theories of celestial mechanics. 

 At one time he had toured the universities and had been invited to Carnegie Institute in relation to these subjects. 

 Of his early services to the Baha'i Cause there is much of historic importance. 

 In cooperation with Mrs. Fannie G. Lesch, who had collected the material, and with the financial assistance of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, as reported by Mrs. Lesch, he published the first book of the Tablets of Holy Baha'i Writings ever to be printed in America. Likewise, Mrs. Lesch states, he published the first volume of "I-f dden Words" translated


<p496>
496             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  in this country. With the approval of Abdu'l-Baha, he published, as he told this writer, the Album of beautifully colored photographs of Baha'i Holy Places in Palestine  — these photographs had been taken by a Greek photographer. The beautiful Tablet,  the first which CAbdu~1~Bahi chanted into a phonograph to be retained in record form, was chanted after continued solicitation by Dr. Getsinger that He grant such a request, and the record was brought to America by Dr. Getsinger in 1899. 

 In that pamphlet of glorious promise and encouragement to American Baha'is written by 

Shoghi Effendi, Guardian   

 of the Faith, in the year 1933, and called "A and The Most Great Peace," the Baha'i Faith is divided into four decades to include the forty years, from 1893 to 1933, of its development  in America. 

 In each of these decades Dr. Getsinger had lived as a Baha'i according  to his ever growing understanding and development. He was an old and tried believer. 

 A friend has written of him: ~'My memories of him are very precious of a firm, faithful believer who gave all that he had of Baha'i treasures, his knowledge and anything he could do to serve the glorious Cause of 

Baha'u'llah."

     SARAH BLTJNDELL            

  One of the pioneers of the Baha'i Cause in New Zealand — Mrs. Sarah Blundell —  passed away at her home in Auckland on December 20, 1934, at the advanced age of eighty-four years. She was born at Burwell, Cambridgeshire, England in 1850 — the year sacred in Baha'i history as that of the Bib's martyrdom. 

 Mrs. Blundell received her early religious training from her father, Mr. 

Henry Andrews — a Nonconformist

 of strong convictions and high principles. 

 Before the age of seven she had acquired a knowledge of Bible history and a desire to be good." 

 At this time little Sarah was sent to boarding school — an orthodox estab lishment; the child was withdrawn from religious instruction at the request of her Nonconformist parents. 

 This experience of withdrawal was a sore trial to the sensitive child, but its effect was to make her search for causes and think for herself. This gave rise in her immature mind to what later deveLoped into a wholehearted and unfettered  search for Truth. It was during her school days that Sarah Andrews heard faint echoes of the terrible religious persecutions in fr&n, which later she identified with the BThis. She remembered vividly wondering why such deeds should be perpetrated because  of religion. She was an intelligent student and before leaving school at the age of eighteen she was among the first group of young ladies permitted to enter for a Cambridge University Examination — a sign in those days of the coming advancement of women. 

 In her early thirties Mrs. Blundell received a definite spiritual awakening. 

 Such an experience  can never be adequately described by words. When speaking of it to the writer, she said, "I thought I was in Heaven. Texts of scripture poured into my mind with new meaning." In the light of this awakening she received such deep spiritual joy and strength that the material troubles she was at that time encountering became as nothing. So having received ThU for her lamp" she continued her journey in the ctValley of Search" with unwavering faith and hope. Some years later in a state of perplexity, she took her problem to God in prayer. She heard a voice which said, "Can you go through poverty?" 

 Her trustful reply  was, tcThrough anything or anywhere with Thee, Lord." 

 In 1887, when Mrs. Blundell with her husband and family of seven children arrived in New Zealand, her faith was put to the test. Here she experienced for a time, not oniy lack of material wealth, and the comforts of life to which she was accustomed, but also lack of friends, for she came as a stranger to a strange country. 

 She passed through these years of trial and testing with cheerful courage, firm in her belief in God's help and guidance. 

 In her search for Truth she passed through many fields of thought, emerging through

  Sarah Blundell, 18501934. 

  the mists of dead creeds and dogmas, always following the light, and helping doubtful and troubled souls to set their feet on the path of spiritual endeavour. 

     From the "Christian Commonwealth" Mrs.

 Blundell first heard of cAbdu~1~Bah4~s visit to London in 1911. There she read of His life and teachings, and was at once attracted.  She sent for literature which she read with an open mind and prepared heart, so when in 1922, Mr. and Mrs. Hyde Dunn came to Auckland to spread the Baha'i message,  Mrs. Blundell invited them to her home and there the first Baha'i meeting was held. 

 In 1925, Mrs. Blundell was one of the first party of Pilgrims from Australia and New Z~a1and who were privileged to visit Haifa

 of the BTh, Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-Bah6., and to come into personal contact with many confirmed Baha'is — a ttcrowning gift" to one whose spiritual path had been traveled alone. 

 Whilst in London, she said to the late Mrs. 

Claudia Coles, CCEor       

 me, the search is over.~~ From her acceptance of the Baha'i revelation till the end of her life she experienced complete spiritual joy and contentment. The words of cAbdu~I~BaM were fully cx-emplified in her life: "Sacrifice all thy talents  at the feet of that heart-enkindling Beloved and characterize thyself with such deeds and words that thou mayest become the cause of the guidance of others." She worked unsparingly for the Cause of Baha'u'llah  in New Zealand until her failing physical powers could no longer reflect her loving spirit and her body was laid aside as a wornout tool. 

 She passed away peacefully in the presence of members of her family, who received comfort and strength through the spirit of triumphant joy which filled the room and which took away the sting of death. 

 Truly for her death was as "glad tidings." In the hearts of New Zealand

  Baha'is she will ever be a shining example of a beautiful and consecrated life. 

 Mrs. Blundeli's father, Mr. Henry Andrews, in the days of his early manhood was one of a group of young men who met each day at midday for prayer and Bible study in a room at the business house of Messrs. Hitchcock & Williams, St. Paul's Church Yard, London. Mr. Williams, one of the heads of the firm, on hearing of this meeting was greatly impressed, and the idea was born of forming the organization which is known all over the world as the Young Men's 

Christian Association.     

  Mrs. Blundell's gift as a pianist was above the average. Her music master in Germany wished her to enter the profession, but this her parents did not agree to. All her life she used her talent, giving pleasure to many. Her soui qualities spoke through her fingers, uplifting her hearers with the spirit in the music. On her eightieth birthday she played for those who gathered at her home for that event.

 During the whole period of his new Baha'i life he was well known by his activities in the Cause not oniy at his birthplace but also at BaghdAd and in most parts of tlriq. 

 Although he was a villager by birth, illiterate and very far from scholastic life, an agriculturist and landlord by calling, yet through the sublime spiritual influence of the Cause he could eloquently present proofs

  of the Cause confirmed by Verses from the Qur'an and Hadith to all classes of people, in such convincing manner that they became surprised by his inspired and effective speech. 

 He was one of the few old believers who attended the court as a witness while the case of the houses of Baha'u'llah was under trial. Amidst the infuriated populace he pushed his way to the court and very courageously and boldly declared his faith and gave the necessary testimony and paid no heed to the menaces and intimidations, though his life was exposed to inevitable death under such critical circumstances. 

 He was the real mover of the Friends of ~Av6shiq and the one to whom they came for help, guidance and counsel. lie was an important factor in erecting the Haziratu'l-Quds of his locality, which was the first of its kind in tlriq. 

 Lie was secretary to the Spiritual Assembly,  and on formation of the National Spiritual  Assembly of IrAq in 1931, he was elected a member of it, which post he held until the end of his life. 

 He was privileged twice during his life to be honored by visiting our beloved Guardian  and was a recipient of his loving kindness and appreciations, which increased considerably his activities and self-sacrifice. 

 His tragic death occurred on January 9, 1936, in consequence of a falling down of a section of the Haziratu'1-Quds of Baghdad where he was sleeping with his eldest son JsmANl and both of them died immediately. This sad news was communicated to the Guardian, who immediately sent a telegtam of deep sympathy and hearty condolences to the Friends of tAvishiq which was followed by a letter in appreciation of his brilliant services, the translation of an extract of which, written by his secretary, is as follows:  —  "That zealous servant of God has rendered excellent and sublime services to the threshold of his merciful God.

He never let any opportunity pass without manifesting his self-sacrifice and sincerity and let no chance slip away without showing his gallantry and solemnity. So it is no wonder if this sudden and unexpected  incident caused a deep grief and intense sorrow to the Guardian who entertained  so great an attachment to him, was utterly satisfied with him, and had complete confidence in him."

    The late Ijaji Mubammad    

 Yazdi, the son of ~Abdu'1-Rahim-i-Yazdi, was born about 1850 in Yazd, and at the same time as his elder brother, the late Shaykh~CA1i, he achieved in early youth the privilege of becoming a BaUM. He then became the recipient  of blessed Tablets from Baha'u'llah and was singled out for especial grace. To such a degree was he set aflame that he spent most of his time either in teaching the Cause to his friends and kindred, in holding Baha'i feasts and gatherings in his home or in chanting the Tablets and prayers. 

 At last, however, he could no longer endure his longing  for the presence of Baha'u'llah; he set out with the late Ifl4ji Amin on his first journey to the Holy Land, and there, in cAkka, he attained to meeting with the Blessed 

Beauty.                    

 Afterward, with the permission of Baha'u'llah,  Mubammad Yazdi went to Alexandria in Egypt and settled there. 

 In Alexandria around the year 1870, he and the late Ijiji Siyyid Jav~id-i-Yazdi undertook the postal despatch of tablets from Baha'u'llah to the Baha'is of IrAn and of letters from the latter to the Holy Land. Within a few years some of the Baha'is who had come together in Alexandria established a trading company, and conducting their affairs with great and spiritual harmony, they prospered. At that period all the 'Akka pilgrims traveled  by way of Alexandria; from the frinian Gulf, from India, from the Caucasus and Turkey, I rinian and other believers would come to the Holy Land, and whether going or returning they would be the guests of the Alexandria friends. 

 Meanwhile, in addition to the Alexandria interests, Muhammad Yazdi opened a store in tAkk4 with his close friend the late Siyyid tAli Yazdi and the two carried on business there. In 1882, as a consequence of the rebellion of cArrAbi PAsh~ the occupation of Alexandria by Great Britain, the great fire and the general confusion, he left for the Holy Land, returning some seven months later. 

 When in 1892, the life of every Baha'i was darkened by the ascension of Baha'u'llah, he, suffering bitterly from separation from his Beloved, in accord with the Will and Testament of Baha'u'llah turned toward the Center of the Covenant, and, fully obedient to cAbdu~1.~Bahi, remained firm in the Cause. At that period he was instrumental in establishing a Spiritual Assembly which achieved renown. He later made of his residence in Ramlih (Alexandria) a gathering place for the believers, it being his custom to hold regular Sunday meetings lasting from afternoon till nearly midnight, at which occasions the believers would come together, partake of refreshments and chant the holy prayers and Tablets. Whenever the Master and members of the Household would visit that city, he exerted every effort in carrying out the Master's behests. 

 Previous  to this he married Jamilih Kh&num, daughter of the late tAli Manshidiy-i-Yazdi, and believers from various parts of Egypa, from Port Said and Alexandria came to Ramlih for the wedding. 

 During the World War, from 1914 to 1917, Muhammad Yazdi carried on business in Beirut and Damascus, and also in Haifa with my brother, Aq~ Mirza ~{usayn. When the ascension of the beloved Master had plunged the believers into sorrow, he turned, obedient to the Master's Testament, to the Guardian of the Cause, remaining staunch and steadfast. Around 1925, he went back to Port Said, engaging in business in the store of his brother, Ahmad Yazdi, and almost yearly he would journey to visit the Guardian and pray at the Holy Shrines. In his eighty-fourth year, Mubammad Yazdi was struck by a motor cycle and passed away September 5, 1933. He is survived

       IN MEMORLAM                

  Death pro jjeretb unto every confident believer the cup that is life indeed. It be stowet /5 joy, and is the bearer of gladness. It con f erreth the gift of everlasting life. 

 As to those that have tasted the fruit of man's earthly existence, which is the recognition  of the one true God, exalted be His glory, their life hereafter is such as We are unable to describe. 

 The knowledge thereof is with God, alone, the Lord of all worlds. —  Baha'u'llah.

             NOTES ON THE PRONUNCIATION
                     OF IRANIAN

  The emphasis in IrAnian words is more or less evenly distributed, each syllable being  equally stressed as in French. 

 For example,  do not say Tabriz or Tabarsi; stay as long on one syllable as on the next:-Tab-  riz; Ta-bar~si. (While there are many exceptions  to this rule, it is the most generally correct method of treating the question of stress.) 

 A frequent mistake is the failure to distinguish between broad and flat "a's." This differentiation makes the language especially musical and should be observed: in the word Afnin, for example, pronounce the first "a" as in mat, and the second syllable to rhyme with on. Americans are apt to pronounce short tta" plus "r" like the verb form are; this is a mistake; Ce" should be pronounced  as in the name of Harry — cf. Tarbiyat. 

 The same differentiation should be observed  in the case of long and short ~ and long and short "u." As the guide to the transliteration indicates, short "i" is like in best, and long ~i" like "ce" in meet; for example, IbrAhirn is pronounced Eb-ri-heern; Islim is Ess-lahm. Short C!u~~ being like "o" in short, and long like ~ in moon, the following would be pronounced: 

Quddfis — Qod-dooss; Birfunish — Bir-fo-roosh. 

 Pronounce "aw" to rhyme with oh, or mown; Naw-RiAz is No-Rooz. 

 The following consonants may be pronounced  like z: dh z z I The following consonants may be pronounced  like ss: di s s Zh is pronounced like the "s" in pleasure. Kh is pronounced like "ch" in Scotch loch or German nacht, Do not pronounce it as "k." Westerners are as a rule incapable or pronouncing gh and ~q"; a guttural French r will serve here; otherwise use hard g as in good. 

 H and h, approximately like the English aspirate cth~~ should never be dropped. Tihr4n is Teli-ron; madrisih is mad-res-seh; MihrTh is Melt-rob. 

 In the case of double letters pronounce each separately: tAb-bis. 

 The character transliterated if) repre-seas  a pause; it is not unlike the initial sound made in pronouncing such a word as every. The word Baha is phonetically as follows: aa~~ as in account; CC?' 

 as in father ('), pause; i as ee in meet. 

 The character transliterated (C) may also be treated as a pause. 

 N.B. As IrAnian often indicates no vowel sounds and as its pronunciation differs in different localities throughout I r~n and the Near East as well as among individuals in any given locality, a uniform system of transliteration such as the above, which is in use by Baha'i communities all over the world, is indispensable to the student.

RELIGION AND WORLD ORDER
                  B~ HORACE HOLLEY

  J Twas oniy a few generations ago when the people ceased thinking that man, with the animals and plants, inhabited a world composed of ccdead~ matter. Life was conceived to be that which could think, feel, move or at least which could grow and reproduce. 

 As the notion of "life" has become extended  until it includes all matter, all substance,  and every ingredient and constituent of substance, so has the notion of religion developed until it applies to the whole of man. No longer is religion confined, like a small island in a great sea, to that little area of belief and practice specialized under the influence of a formal creed. It is the entire human life, its conscious and unconscious elements, its personal and social relationships, its affirmations and denials, its triumphs and defeats, its hidden as well as its revealed awareness and action, its unrealized possibility along with its recognized, admitted  frustration and impotence. 

 The real aim of the physical sciences is fulfilled in knowledge of man. 

 The physical  and chemical principles discovered in the world have meaning oniy as they are principles of human life. Man himself is the universe in miniature. 

 Physical science thus becomes part of a larger science of biology, and biological science in turn becomes a chapter in the greater volume of the human science, psychology. 

 A man's whole life, and not merely his conscious creedal practice, is his religion. His highest love is conditioned by his profoundest  hate; his supreme sacrifice is limited  by his unconscious selfishness; his ideals and his daily life are a single reality, one and inseparable. 

 The social sciences likewise are dependent for their validity on human psychology. When a science calling itself "economics" gives official sanction for cruel indifference; when a science calling itself tcpolitics~~ finds £rnperatives for armed frontiers, this lack of agreement between these social sciences and the sanctions of the separate department of human life called ttreligion" does not mean that men live in three separate worlds, obeying  three mutually exclusive ~'1aws" — it means simply that a general failure in the realm of motive and understanding has pro —  jected itself outward into society, and this failure men try to conceal from themselves and each other by labeling the antireligious actions one or another ccciece3~ But just as these evasions and attempts at concealment in personal life sooner or later come to a balance of accounts with every other element of the personality, so the elaborate  myth called "civilization" has now become rent to fragments as the social cc sciences" and the formal creeds alike eventuate in a society which as a whole does nor know how to survive. It matters not which element of the whole result is made the scapegoat — whether formal ttreligion~~ or economics or politics" — the truth is that man himself has failed in his social relationships,  and this failure in turn rests upon failure in his relationship to himself. The fictitious separation of life into formal departments,  each with an exclusive label, has been unconscious evasion of reality the final result of which was inevitable from the beginning. 

 On no other basis can we erect a spiritual knowledge preserving the responsibility on which integrity depends. 

  At some definite point of experience, the conscious person comes to realize the oneness of the universe and the wholeness of human personality. His formal religious beliefs undergo  profound adjustment as he perceives 571


<p572>
572             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  their artificial separateness from the rest of his existence. 

 Able no longer to isolate CtSunday~~ from the remaining days of the week, his new sense of cause and effect compels him to fit his religious values into experience as a whole. This adjustment in some cases enhances the whole of life with new spiritual possibility; in other cases what had been a mere artificial belief or practise is destroyed, and life as a whole becomes secular and without spiritual content. 

 The philosophic projection of this awareness  is pantheism or atheism — both are based upon an effort to realize the universe as homogeneous, as one. 

 The only difference between pantheism and atheism is that the former raises everything to the "high" level of God, or Spirit, or Providence while the latter reduces everything to the "low" level of matter and natural law. 

 The similarity between pantheism and atheism is more vital than the difference. Both philosophies establish one single level; both maintain a view of the universe which interprets experience in terms of cause and effect operating on one plane. 

 There is little real distinction between realizing all substance as "God" and realizing all experience  as subject to natural law; for both views deprive one of the necessity of making any truly vital choice. 

 The realization of oneness, in fact, is but a starting point in the search for religion. Religion is distinctiveness as well as universality. 

 Historically, religion has a definite point of origin. No religion has come into existence  without a Founder, a Prophet or Messiah. 

 Whether one considers Christianity, Judaism, Mubammadanism or any other organic religion historically, what appears is the phenomenon  of religion as an experience suddenly  interposed into the current stream of human life. This interposition compels the most vital choice or decision which life can offer. It creates a new standard of reality rising like a mountain from the plain of daily intercourse. 

 Its influence sets the individual  against his own past, and historically has always made a definite cleavage in the course of civilization. The prophet becomes identified with a higher possibility in the present, which necessatily divides the future from the past. Life tends to become dynamic  and assert new directions, while the past exists in the present as inertia. 

  Religious history is meaningless when conceived  merely as a time sequence without reference to the fundamental law of cycles. 

 We take for granted the existence of this law whenever dealing with natural phenomena:  the cycle of life operating for the tree from seed to fruit, for the human being from birth to death, even for the stars of immensest magnitude. But societies and social institutions seldom or never admit that for their own existence there is also an allotted period, the beginning of which is their birth, the end of which is their destruction,  during the course of which they rise to a climax of maturity and power, receding thereafter until eventually they are no more. 

 Tracing this development in Judaism we come to the civilization of Solomon, a glory that could not be retained. In Christianity we have the feudal age, when religion could be completely identified with civilization, after which the Reformation destroyed the unity not oniy of the church but of the civilization as well. Here stands the origin of "modern" times, which actually have been the autumn and winter of faith, On one side has existed an alliance between national  state, natural science, industry and militarism; on the other side the tradition of feudal aristocracy, the memory of a living  unifying faith, the organization of the church. 

 Both phases in reality proceeded from the same prior condition. One can not be termed CcChiti " and the other "pagan" or "non — Christian" with the slightest historical accuracy. For modern militarism, justified as the necessary virtue of the national  state, derives immediately from the Crusades, justified as the necessary virtue of the church. The profit motive, justified as the necessary virtue of industry, derives immediately  from the practice of the sale of indulgences, justified as the necessary virtue of the church. If modern science is con


<p573>
RELIGION AND WORLD ORDER                                  573

  demned as "pagan," a vast power delivered over to the secular realm, it must be recalled  that the first faint beginnings of natural science were so resisted by the church that the scientists were compelled to develop their knowledge outside the religious community. 

 The Reformation, then, merely marks the point at which the historical religion has reaped its harvest, produced its richest fruit; and consequently could no longer maintain its internal unity nor its balance between religion and civilization. 

 The law of cycles operates in the case of religions and nations no less imperatively than in the case of trees, animals, planets and human beings. This law may for a time appear inoperative where the larger social bodies are concerned, but this is merely for the reason that man has yet attained no adequate sense of historical process, and also because even after a great social institution has died spiritually it can still survive physically  for a relatively long period. But when a religion ceases to be the motive and inspiration of civilization, its date of death is recorded in the annals of destiny. 

 And once this spiritual death has taken place, the religion  can never be artificially revived. 

 The "modern" world, striving to transform  nationalism into world order, overcome the antagonism of economic classes and reconcile peoples and creeds, is nothing else than a larger example of ancient Rome striving to maintain order, justice and law after its original impulse had ebbed and the creative power had passed from the imperial governrneht to the weak, despised and minority body of Christians, reborn by the mystery of superhuman faith. Our social institutions are more powerful to destroy than to create; no matter how conscienti —  ously administered, without transformation they are vessels not built to otitride this time of worldwide stornii. 

  When the creative power of spirit is withdrawn from the community as a whole, and the parts of the community engage in mutual struggle for predominance or survival, the life cycle of that social order has run its course. 

 Such is the nature of the present crisis. The old order was based historically upon Christianity in the 

West, upon Muluiarn-manadism 

 and other Faiths in the East. Each Faith had, in accordance with the principle underlying human society, developed  a characteristic civilization representing a balance between legal, cultural, economic and social factors. All these regional  civilizations had arrived at that stage in the cyclic process marked by the weakening  of the original religious impulse, which bound the civilization together in one organism, and by the assertion of the superiority of the constituent parts over the whole. 

 As in Christianity a few centuries ago, so in Mubanarnadanism today, law, government, education and industry have thrown off the control of the religious tradition and undergone separate development, each seeking a fulfilment in terms of its own independent need and without reference to the general need of the community in its spiritual  as well as material integrity. This development is more complete in the West, but the history of Europe since the Reformation has been paralleled in all essentials by the more recent experience of Turkey, Egypt and Inn. 

 The crucial point in this development is the transfer of social authority from a religious  organization, by which it has been fatally abused, to a secular organization explicitly claiming to be unmoral. 

 At the stage of religious decay where this transfer of authority takes place, the secular government cannot control the entire area previously controlled by the religious influence. 

 The transfer is characterized by the rise of several independent secular governments which divide the body of believers into separate, and potentially competitive nations. 

 Western nationality arose from the spiritual death of Christendom, and the nations  of IsUm are similarly independent and exclusive. 

 The next step in the process, which in reality is disintegration and not ccprogress~~ except in a local and temporary degree, consists  in the reinforcement of the secular (unmoral) authority by such laws and instruments as it deems necessary to protect itself in die rapidly augmenting struggle for


<p574>
574             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  national existence. Religion is replaced by patriotism of an exclusive nature, and the social duty of man becomes defense of his national state. Militarism inevitably develops. 

 Compulsory military duty, found necessary as economic rivalry follows the original territorial competition of the states, sets mankind upon the path of death. 

 In the modern world this complete divorce  between spiritual and material values, enmeshing human life in a fatal net as economic  and social existence come to depend upon struggle and competition rather than upon unity and cooperation, establishes a point of crisis imperilling the race. Authority,  power and initiative throughout society are identified with unmoral institutions whose fiat controls a system of destruction well-nigh universal in capacity. 

 On the other hand, the spiritual tradition of each race has become sterile, for ecciesiasticism is the negation of faith. 

 Such a jungle of competitive nationalism seems to reproduce, in terms of social organizations, the era of the prehistoric monsters marking an early stage in the biological evolution  of the world of nature. Forms of life organized almost entirely for offense and defense had little available energy for the kind of response required in a changing world. Evolution left them behind. Their towering strength was their fatal weakness, and in their enormous aggressiveness they had no capacity to survive. 

 In the same way, the present stage of armed, competitive nationalism is essentially transitory and fugitive. The more aggres —  sive it becomes, the less its capacity to meet social problems the oniy solution of which is non-aggresion — cooperation. 

 The states have waxed powerful upon the poverty of the people; their might is an illusion. They can destroy themselves by one final outburst of general war; or a series of revolutions, each perhaps small and almost unnoted, will evolve from them a type of government intelligent enough to deal with social relationships  and moral enough to summon the highest and not the lowest impulses of an evolving race. 

 The key to future social evolution lies in the capacity for transformation rather than in mere progress and extension along the lines fixed by our prior history. For progress is the law of the cycle, but transformation is the sign that a cycle has run its term and a new age has dawned. 

 It is evolutionary progress when a form of life becomes larger, or fleeter by adaptation  to its environment. 

 This type of progress marks the biological world, where the natural environment is fundamentally constant. 

 Likewise, when the ~ocial environment  remains fundamentally constant, an institution progresses by growth in ways determined by its original character and aim. 

 Unlike nature, the social environment is subject to profound alteration. 

 The development  of machine production was more than progress from a small tool to a larger tool; it brought about an entirely different kind of society. 

 Action and reaction in an industrialized society are not simply enlargement of the action and reaction of an agricultural, handcraft society — they respond in quality to a different law. The plane has been raised from physical effort to intelligence. 

 As long as the simple law of progress applies to human society, the evil will be multiplied along with the good, the destruction  will augment by the same ratio as the construction. 

 The symbol of transformation in the natural world is the organism like the butterfly,  which at one stage is an egg, at the next stage is a caterpillar, becomes then a chrysalis in its cocoon, thence emerging as imago, the perfect insect with beautifully colored wings. Applying the law of simple progress to this organism at any preliminary stage, we would have merely a larger egg, or a greater cat~rpi11ar or a larger and stronger cocoon. Metamorphosis is the scientific  equivalent of that organic change which takes place in human society at those critical stages marked by the cycles of religion. 

 It is by no means necessary to contemplate  a simple extension into the future of the social agencies dominating this transitional era. The progress of national government  into empire is strictly limited by interstate competition, and the progress of religion into the condition of world empire by any one creed is no less impossible.


<p575>
RELIGION AND WORLD ORDER                                  575

  The impermanence of the several civilizations now existing becomes clear when we give attention to the nonsocial character of the religions from which they separately sprang. 

 In the saying, "Give unto Caesar" we are compelled to note that the Founder of Christianity limited His spiritual teaching to persons, to individuals, and refrained from extending that teaching to establish a principle for society. 

 The character and scope of the Christian teaching, at its source, clearly contemplated an era during which individuals were to cultivate a spiritual life, purifying their inner motives and assuming responsibility for their deeds, in contrast to and complete disregard of their social institutions. 

 They were to seek a Kingdom in the realm of the awakened and conscious soul, but the world was Caesar's and the successors of 

Caesar.                    

 Moreover, that doctrine, at its source, does not fail to include a social principle alone: it is in essence a doctrine of the ttheart~~ and makes no provision for the life of the mind, It justifies no particular social form, creates a basis for no particular type of social institution, and in nowise explains those aspects of life and the universe which constitute the ends of psychology and philosophy. 

 It renewed man's inner life, it revealed more fully than ever before the nature of God and the spiritual capacity of human beings; it released a quality of personal relationships on the high plane required  to maintain the new vision of the sanctity of life; but Christianity, at its source and in its reality, supports no political  principle, sustains no economic theory, outlines no cosmogony, throws no light upon man's relation to the physical universe, and sanctions no conception of the function of mind. 

 These organic limitations, imposed not by absence of power at the Source but by lack of capacity in the environment and age, mark a cycle whose term was set at its beginning. 

 It signalizes one necessary stage in the evolution of religion, or rather in the upward march of conscious human life, but finality is entirely absent, because the requi site foundation in revealed truth for the wholeness of life was not spiritually established. 

 Unlike a scientific formula, religious truth does not continue indefinitely and independent of the way it is applied. While a chemical action can be employed for good or evil ends with equal efficiency, a spiritual truth, to possess validity, must include the vital element represented by the believer's quality of response. When the quality of response has fallen below the level of the aim implied in the truth, the truth becomes void of influence. 

 The living impulse sent forth from its Source has been expended; what remains is a form of words, a lifeless symbol, a ceremony possessing psychic but not spiritual  effect. 

 Civilization is the outworking of spiritual faith. That faith inspires fresh courage, removes the barriers of personality and groups, stimulates the mind to solve necessary  problems from the point of view of the society as a whole, establishes a foundation of human reality raised above the bestial struggle for existence, and enables mankind to take one more forward step in its progress upon the eternal path. 

 There is, however, no historical permanence for any civilization equivalent to the universality of revelation upon the plane of soui. Until mankind is united within one true faith and within one order of justice and knowledge, the need of the renewal and enlargement of spiritual truth is manifest to all.

 The external surface of human life, as recorded by sympathetic observers in every country, has become marked by appalling personal misery. Its innumerable details constitute  a catalog which oppresses the heart like a Book of Doom. By war, by influenza, by poverty and by revolution a vast number of people have been reduced to a narrow margin of existence we thought had been left behind with the memories of the stone age before history began. 

 But this external surface does not reflect th~ entire content of modern life. 

 The observer who concentrates all his attention upon the evidences of misfortune and suf

  fering must be balanced by those who look with equal clarity beneath physical evidence to the inner surface and the foundations upon which human life is established. 

 The world of the mind is rich with infinite possibilities,  in tragic contrast to the poverty of the world of the body. 

 From the world of truth, as from an inexhaustible mine, we have derived truly miraculous reinforcement for the feeble body in its eternal struggle against the environment of nature. No longer need human aspiration and will be limited in fulfillment by the inadequate tool of hand and arm, directed by the inaccurate and incomplete guidance of the five physical senses. Mechanisms as sensitive as thought itself, as powerful as human ambition requires,  stand as servants ready to carry out any material command. However far imagination  may fly ahead, it can reach no ultimate limit beyond which the creative thought of the race dare not go. But these two worlds, the world of body and the world of mind, though man lives native in both, appear to coexist independently, in a relationship which is a separation  no less than it is a contact. 

 The scientist's achievement in the form of truth has no human equivalent in the form of social security. 

 The inventor's technic has complicated existence but multiplied poverty. 

 The world of truth is the modern Tantalus cup, offering what life cannot receive,  even while it is likened to the slave of the lamp, fulfilling every command. 

 Social systems and programs devised during  the last hundred years have one and all been efforts to confirm the contact and overcome the separation between the world of truth and the world of human experience. They have sought to mediate between the possibility of mind and the actuality of social need. What thought has accomplished  in efficiency of mechanism it has endeavored to duplicate in efficiency of human relations. But every system and program combining the possibility of scientific  truth with the social ingredient of human nature has produced not order but an increase of conflict. What appears perfectly  fused in the crucible of abstract speculation reasserts its duality when put to the test of life. Socialism, communism, capitalism fundamentalist or reformed — all these systems alike — are unmistakably incapable  of reconciling and blending the worlds of body and mind, the truths of science and society. The more that arbitrary  power is applied to compel their acceptance as programs, the more explosive becomes the reaction of the human nature coerced in the name of efficiency and truth. Ours is not the first civilization to be brought to an end by mental capacity devoid of spiritual truth. 

 The unescapable historic fact is that the mediator between universe and humanity, the link between the world of truth and the world of social experience, has never been the speculative mind but the Prophet. 

 The mind discovers oniy that which it seeks; its voyages of exploration bring back oniy that reality which can be confined in the small cage of material reason. The universe is not such captive truth, such mastered knowledge. 

 The universe is the Will above and beyond man's physical will; that Will by which man must become and not merely possess, by which man must serve and not merely enslave to himself. The life and words of a Moses, a Jesus, a Muhammad, by the spirit inspiring them are truth. Within that truth, since it contains man and is not merely man's exploitation of what he contains, the life of the race is secure and progressive. Outside that truth, human existence moves ever toward destruction; for the Prophet is truth in that form in which it applies to the life of mankind. 

 By each Prophet is established a new civilization,  because each Prophet establishes a spirtual world for the sour not less real than the nature which is the world of the body. The modern age, in all its social relationships,  lies outside the spiritual world. 

 Hence its agony, its frustration physical and mental, the degradation of an unrepentant Prodigal 

Son.                       

  Never has there been such a time of sincere,  wholehearted searching for a foundation grounded not upon secondary, temporary  historical events and developments but upon the nature of the universe itself.


<p577>
RELIGION AND WORLD ORDER                                  577

  This age, in its spirit, feels nearer to the ancient Prophets than has any generation since the first generation of believers laid down their lives that the divine Cause might prevail. Not in Christendom alone, but in the other existing civilizations, the appeal to the pure manifestation of love and wis-dorn, the racial Prophet, has become for many the last refuge of hope that human life can endure, can be meaningful and blessed upon this troubled earth. 

 Between themselves and that radiant Source of hope they feel the long centuries of strife and ignorance fading to the unreality  of a frantic dream. Let mankind, they cry from the depths of their souis, Jet mankind make a new beginning; let life rest upon the sure foundation of the Divine will; let us become transformed, renewed with a new spirit, and in that spirit proceed to transform all things which are in denial of or in conflict with that eternal will. The nations hurry to destruction, they lament, when vision perishes. From this undying flame let our hearts and minds be kindled with the fire of love. 

 As the crisis persists, this call, feeble at first, becomes louder and more assured. First a personal attitude, then a social movement, gathering force and momentum, the going back to the Prophet now represents a mighty psychological crusade paralleling the physical crusades of medieval times. 

 To what degtee can this movement be fulfilled? 

 The Prophet himself made a fundamental condition, that those who sought to follow him should abandon their goods, their wealth, and walk in his path. 

 This was said to a rich man's son, but does it not apply likewise to those who have inherited goods and wealth in the realm of mind? Does it not mean that those who seek to return today must abandon their acquired culture, their traditional philosophy, their ecclesiastical institutions, their rites and ceremonies,  their pomp of church and churchly power? 

 Either it means this, or it means nothing at all, for the Prophet was not slain by the materially rich of his day, he was slain by order of the established church. 

 For Christendom, surely, the sincerity of all effort to establish life upon Divine rather than upon human will must be tested by conformity to the conditions its own Prophet laid down. 

 When the churches voluntarily disband, and people of all denominations and sects seek the Prophet upon absolutely equal terms, then, and then alone, will this psychological crusade reach the Holy Land. As long as certain individual believers alone fulfil this test, the movement will not affect the vital problems of civilization but remain in the limited realm of personal experience. It may produce a beautiful literature; it will not carry civilization outside its captivity to the lords of war. 

 There is also, it would appear, another essential condition to be met in this poignant  appeal from the world to God: the recognition that other races iikewise had their Prophets, their revelations of the Divine  will. For without such recognition, the crusade goes hostile and armed, a challenge to battle and not a conquest of universal  peace. These two conditions — at root one condition seen in two different aspects —  may fairly be said to be so difficult of realization as to be highly improbable, if not impossible, at least without one single precedent  in human history. 

 Rivers flow downhill; and the water once descended from its spring does not return. 

  A contemporary historian remarks that the old world has died, but a new world has not yet been born. This view is no doubt the expression of an attitude which has come to prevail among many thoughtful people over a wide social area. 

 It perceives that the foundation of the civilization existing  prior to the European War cannot be rebuilt; it realizes to the full the present instability of conditions and the lack of agreement among aims and programs; it frankly admits that the future, both in general trend and in outline, is concealed from the rational mind. Its clarity of analysis of the past is matched by its incapacity for synthesis directed toward the future. 

 'What emerges from consideration of this frank and sincere assertion is awareness of the artificial limitation assumed by the rational intelligence in dealing with the process  of human history. By the phrase "old

  world" and ctew world" it means civilization as formal institutions and established habits, and thereby overlooks the significant fact that civilization is an effect and not primarily a cause. 

 For civilization, long before it emerges in formal institutions, exists as an aspiration of the heart, as an ideal to be pursued and fulfilled by every faculty of mind and soul. It is oniy when human aspiration and ideal, shared by a considerable group or community,  has gathered force and thrust through to the plane of social action, that civilization actually begins. Without this preliminary period of spiritual action, no civilization has ever become manifest. That period is to the later formal institutions and habits and doctrines as the root to the visible tree. 

 Though the entire tree is potentially present in the seed, the great trunk and the widespread branches are contingent upon a period of prior and invisible growth within the soil. 

 To complete the thoughtful statement uttered by the historian, it is necessary to seek for the future ttld" not in different programs and expedients adopted by the institutions of the dead ~~ orid" but in evidences  of a spiritual life intense enough, universal enough, to establish within humanity  that inner power required to raise the trunk and spread forth the branches of a tree whose fruit shall be universal peace. 

 World order, it is clear, represents a goal which includes the reconciliation of two values or ideals: the spiritual value of human brotherhood, and the social value of a united, an organic civilization. 

 Without a firm and enduring basis in moral unity, the institutions of society, no matter how far extended, cannot alone produce peace but will remain as centers of disunity and strife. On the other hand, those instinctive anarchists who preach a "brotherhood" conceived as absence of governmental institutions are naive and immature.  Society without institutions would be a body without vital organs capable of expressing  its various capacities and maintaining its existence. 

 These two values — humanity and civiliza —  tion — have never been reconciled and united within the brief historic period known to the present age. We have had races but not mankind, cultures but not spiritual knowi —  edge, nations but not civilization, and religions  but not a brotherhood embracing the earth. We therefore approach the vital problem of wbrld peace without experience of what world peace really is. World order — the goal of human evolution — can not rightly be conceived as a mere truce or treaty between groups or institutions each born of past strife and discord, each cherishing a secret or avowed superiority and each committed to an ideal of sovereignty incompatible with the needs of permanent peace. 

 Nor can world order be effectively upheld on terms of "non-cooperation" with existing agencies responsible for the little public order which now remains. 

 Peace does not consist in abhorrence of war but in maintaining a steadfast conviction that the end of faith is human unity and the fulfilment  of intelligence is a new social form, worldwide in scope and superior to the local forms which can no longer protect mankind and serve its highest interests. 

 In addition to a political world order, the attainment of universal peace involves: 1.     The harmony and cooperation of races. 

 2.     The unity of religions in a world faith. 

 3.     An economic world order in which capital and labor are conjoined in a relationship of partners and not competitors. 

 4.     Compulsory education throughout the world, and an education grounded in universal  ethics and adapted so as to prepare every child for a useful trade, art or profession. 

 5.     A universal secondary language. 

 Compared to these organic aims, the peace efforts aimed at occasional details such as reduction of armaments or the signing of new treaties are insignificant. 

 The character  of this age is wholly new. It is charged with a spirit of transformation superficially violent but in reality constructive. 

 The whole problem of world order consists in attaining an attitude of reverence and humility  to that creative spirit. 

 The principles briefly stated here were promulgated more than twenty years ago by tAbdu'1-Bah&, in whom the spirit of the age found its most faithful interpreter and its

  noblest exemplar. He declared that human -ity  is entering upon its period of maturity, when powers will be given the world to achieve an organic unity never possible in any previous age. But tAbdu'1-Bahi made the enjoyment of these powers conditional upon purity of motive and acceptance of the oneness of mankind. 

 Not for the people of prejudice and division, not for the organized selfishness of the rich nor the organized envy of the poor, but for those who have become truly human the day of universal peace has dawned. 

 The way backward has become a door that is forever closed. Revolutions  and wars bring no lasting fruit; arbitrary social laws, divorced from human values, bring no true security nor repose. The world needs a central point of inspira tion raised above the clamors of history, a divine element, to supply a foundation for the latent unity within all people of good will. 

 ccTh foundations of all the divine religions are peace and agreement, but misunderstandings and ignorance have developed. If these are caused to disappear you will see that all the religious agencies will work for peace and promulgate the oneness of humankind.  For the foundation of all is reality, and reality is not multiple or divisible. 

 His Holiness Moses founded it, His Holiness Jesus raised its tent, and its brilliant light has shone forth in all the regions. His Holiness Baha'u'llah proclaimed this one reality and spread the message of the tMost Great 

Peace.'

580             THE BAHA'I WORLD

               QUEEN MARIE OF RUMANIA

                  B~ MARTHA L. ROOT

  ~How great the blessedness that awaits the king who will arise to aid My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! 

 Such a king is numbered with the companions  of the Crimson Ark — the Ark which God has prepared for the peopic of Baha. All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid him to unlock, the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Sn ch a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on. the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, 0 people of Baha, your substance, nay, your very lives, for his .1          "1 assistance. 

  Ji1HE first Queen of the world to study and to promote Baha'u'llah's great Teachings  has been 

I-Jet Majesty Queen Marie  

 of Rumania, one of the queens of this twentieth century who stands highest in intel —  lect, in vision, in clear understanding of the new universal epoch now opening. Her Majesty received the book Baha'u'llah and the New Era" by Dr. J. E. Esslernont and a note from the writer of this article who first visited Bucharest, Rumania, in January, 1926. The Rumanian Queen, grand-daugh-ter of the renowned Queen Victoria of the British Empire and of Czar Alexander II of Russia, both of whom received Tablets from Baha'u'llah in their day, read this volume  until three o'clock in the morning and two days later, on January 30, 1926, ceived me in audience in Controceni Palace, in Bucharest. 

 Her first words after the greeting were, ~I believe these Teachings are the solution for the world's problems today!" 

 The account of that historic morning appeared in "The Baha'i Magazine" in Washington, in June, 1926, but very illuminating  letters written by Her Majesty ' Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p.   212. 

 that same year show how deep was her confirmation. 

 Here is one written to her loved friend Loje Fuller, an American then residing  in Paris, which after these ten years can be published for the first time: "Lately great hope has come to me from one, Abdu'l-Baha, a personal follower of Christ. 

 Reading, I have found in His and His Father 

Baha'u'llah's Message       

 of Faith all my yearnings for real religion satisfied. If you ever hear of Baha'is or of the Baha'i Movement which is known in America you will know what that is! What I mean, these books have strengthened me beyond belief and I am now ready to die any day full of hope; but I pray God not to take me away yet, for I still have a lot of work to do." 

 Other letters record that first of all she was teaching her young daughter Ileana about these beautiful truths. 

 For ten years Her Majesty and her daughter, H.R.H. Princess 

Ileana (now Archduchess    

 Anton), have read with interest each new book about the Baha'i Movement as soon as it came from the press. 

 As we know she wrote three marvelous articles about these Baha'i peace Teachings in 1926, and as they were syndicated each article appeared in nearly two hundred newspapers in the United States and Canada. Many millions of people were thrilled to read that a Queen had arisen to promote Baha'u'llah's plan for universal peace. Quickly these articles were translated and published in Europe, China, Japan, Aus —  tralasia and in the Islands of the seas. 
    Received in audience by    

Her Majesty in Pelisor     

 Palace, Sinaja, in 1927, after the passing of His Majesty King Ferdinand, her husband, she graciously gave me an interview, speaking of the Baha'i Teachings about immortality. 

 She had on her table and on the divan a number of Baha'i books, for she had just been reading in each of them the Teachings about Life after death. She asked the writer to give her greeting to Shoghi Effendi, to the friends in fran


<p581>

  and to the many American Baha'is who she said had been so remarkably kind to her during her trip through the United States the year before. Also, she graciously gave the writer an appreciation of these Baha'i Teachings in her own handwriting, for Volume IV. of the CCBah?i World." 

 Meeting the Queen again on January 19, 1928, in the Royal Palace in Belgrade, where she and H.R.H. Princess Ileana were guests of the Queen of Jugoslavia — and they had brought some of their Baha'i books with them — the words I shall remember longest of all that Her dear Majesty said were these: CCT1 ultimate dream which we shall realize is that the Baha'i channel of thought has such strength, it will serve little by little to become a light to all those searching for the real expression of Truth." 

 Another happy audience was in Her Majesty's ioveiy summer palace "Th Yuva," at Baha'i, on the Black Sea, in October, 1929. Again in the home of Archduchess  Anton at Madling near Vienna she and her mother received me on August 8, 1932, and in February, 1933, and Her Majesty  made this great statement which was used as the frontispiece to '~B 1"' World," Volume IV.: "The Baha'i Teaching brings peace and understanding. It is like a wide embrace gathering together all those who have long searched for words of hope. It accepts all great prophets gone before, it destroys no other creeds and leaves all doors open. Saddened by the continual strife amongst believers of many confessions and wearied of their intolerance towards each other, I discovered in the Baha'i Teaching the real spirit of Christ so often denied and misunderstood. Unity instead of strife, Hope instead of condemnation, Love instead of hate, and a great reassurance for all men.~~ Then in the audience in 

Controceni Palace on February

 16, 1934, when Her Majesty was told that the Rumanian translation of (cBh6:~11Ah and the New Era" had just been published in Bucharest, she said she was so happy that her people were to have the blessing of reading this precious 

Teaching.                

 How beautiful she looked that afternoon — as always — for her loving eyes mirror her mighty spirit; a most unusual Queen is she, a consummate artist, a lover of beauty and wherever she is there is glory. 

 Perhaps too, a Queen is a symbol, people like to have their Queen beautiful and certainly Queen Marie of Rumania is one of the most lovely in this world today. Her clothes, designed by herself, are always a ccI~fl ensemble" creation so harmonious in colors they seem to dress her soui. She received me in her private library where a cheerful fire glowed in the quaint, builtin fireplace; tea was served on a iow table, the gold service set being wrought in flowers. There were flowers  everywhere, and when she invited me into her bedroom where she went to get the photograph which I like so much, as I saw the noble, majestic proportions of this great chamber with its arched ceiling in Gothic design, I exciaji-ned in joy, ccYour room is truly a temple, a Mashriqu'1 — Adhk6r!" There were iow mounds of hyacinths, flowers  which Baha'u'llah loved and mentioned often in His Writings; there was a bowl of yellow tulips upon a silken tapestry in yel-'ow  gold, a tall deep urn of fragrant white lilacs, and an immense bowl of red roses. Controceni Palace is the most beautiful palace  I have seen in any country in the blending of its colors and in its artistic arrangements. 

 Her Majesty is a writer as well as an artist, and Her Memoirs entitled 

"The Story of My Life"    

 were just then being published in CCThe Saturday Evening Post." She told me she writes two hours every morning unless her time is invaded by queenly duties, charity duties, family duties. She was pleased with the sincere letters that were pouring in from all continents giving appreciations  of her story. She told me the American people are so openhearted and that from the United States children, professors, farmers' wives and the smart people had written to her, the tone in all their letters revealing Her Majesty's entire sincerity  and the deep humanity of her character. 

 One teacher wrote Her Majesty that in her childhood each one lived through his own childhood: another said, ttAll who read your story have their own lives stirred!" The Queen remarked, "And this is a very snisfactory criticism for an author."


<p582>
582             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  A most pleasing letter had just arrived from Japan from a girl there who thanked God Who had allowed her to live in a period in which such a wonderful book had been written! "This," said the Queen, "is one of the nicest appreciations I have ever heard." 

 Then the conversation turned again to the Baha'i Teachings and she gave a greeting to be sent to Shoghi Effendi in Haifa. Later she mentioned an incident in Hamburg when she was en route to Iceland in the summer of 1933. 

 As she passed through the street, a charming girl tossed a little note to her into the motor car. It was: am so happy to see you in Hamburg, because you are a Baha'i." 

 Her Majesty remarked that they recognized a Baha'i and this shows a spirit of unity in the 

Baha Movement.            

 Her Majesty said to me, "In my heart I am entirely Baha'i," and she sent me this wonderful appreciation: The Baha'i Teaching  brings peace to the soui and hope to the heart. To those in search of assurance the Words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering." 

 And now today, February 4, 1936, I have just had another audience with 

Her Majesty in Controceni  
Palace, in Bucharest.      

 As I was starting to walk up the wide ivory toned stairs carpeted with blue lr~nian rugs to the third floor suites, at that very moment  over a radio came the rich strains of the Wedding March from (cLohengrin,~~ played by an orchestra. It seemed a symbol: the union of spiritual forces of the East and Europe! 

 Again Queen Marie of Rumania received me cordially in her softly lighted library, for the hour was six o'clock. She was gowned in black velvet and wore her great strands of marvelous pearls. The fire in the grate beamed a welcome with its yellow-glowing fragrant pine boughs and large bowls of yellow tulips adorned the apartment. 

 What a memorable visit it was! She told me she has a friend in cAklA, Palestine, who knows Shoghi Effendi and this friend recently has sent her pictures of Akka and Haifa; the two were playfellows when they were children and met in Malta. She also told me that when she was in London she had met a Baha'i, Lady Blomfield, who had shown her the original Message that 

Baha'u'llah               
'u'llih had sent to her    

Grandmother Queen Victoria 

 in London. She asked the writer about the progress of the Baha'i Movement especially in the Balkan countries. 

 ccSince we met two years ago," said Her Majesty, "so many sad events have hap-penedl  I look on with a great deal of sorrow at the way the different peoples seem to misunderstand one another; especially now that I have become very lonely in my home, I have all the more time to think over these problems, and I'm sometimes very sad that I can do so little. 

 However, I know that the right spirit and the right thoughts go a long way towards that unity of hearts which I haven't given up the hope to see before I pass on." She spoke, too, of several Baha'i books, the depths of CCfq~~~~ and especially of ccGleanings from the 

Writings of Bah& —  'u'llih" 

 which she said was a wonderful book! To quote her own words: ccEven doubters would find a powerful strength in it, if they would read it alone and would give their sods time to expand." 

 Her Majesty kindly promised to write for ~'Bah4'i World," Volume~ VI, a special appreciation and to send it after four days. 

 I asked her if I could perhaps speak of the broach which historically is precious to Baha'is, and she replied, ttYes you may." Once, and it was in 1928, Her dear Majesty had given the writer a gift, a lovely and rare brooch which had been a gift to the Queen from Her Royal Relatives in Russia some years ago. It was two little wings of wrought gold and silver, set with tiny diamond  chips and joined together with one large pearl. "Always you are giving gifts to others, and I am going to give you a gift from me," said the Queen smiling, and she herself clasped it onto my dress. The wings and the pearl made it seem "Light-bearing," Baha'i! It was sent the same week to Chicago as a gift to the Baha'i 

Temple, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar

 and at the National Baha'i Convention which was in session that spring, a demur was made — should a gift from the Queen be sold? Should it not be kept as a souvenir of the first Queen who arose to promote the Faith of Baha'u'llah — However, it was sold immediately and the money given to the Temple, for all Baha'is

THE EPIC OF HUMANITY
           From tTh Promise of All Ages"

                   B~ CHRISTOPHIL

  B AHA'U'LLAH revealed a sublime vision of human history as an epic written by the finger of God and proceeding along an ordered course to a climax, the nature of which was exactly defined before the story opened and the appearance of which at the date ordained by the Author no human misunderstanding  nor opposition could prevent or postpone. 

 He taught that human history throughout  its entire length was an intelligible and connected whole, centring round a single theme and developing a common purpose. From the beginning of the cycle to the present day and beyond the present to the cycle's distant end, one master-scheme is by set degrees disclosed. 

 The stage upon which the action moves forward is the entire globe, with all its continents and all its seas; and there is no race nor nation nor tribe nor even individual who has not a designated place in the unfolding of the 

Grand Design of God.      

 This doctrine of the unity of world-his-tory  held in the revelation of Baha'u'llah a position of cardinal importance. 

 He was far from being the first among the Messengers of God to reveal it. Those "prophets which have been since the beginning of the world" and lesser seers as well as they have given glimpses of it to mankind, or have referred to it in symbol and in parable. It is indeed involved in all the historic faiths of the human race, and there is no world-religion extant which can be fully understood without  a knowledge of its truth. But Baha'u'llah was the first to lay on it so great an emphasis and to expound it at large and in plain terms. 

 On it depends the significance of his own advent and the timeliness of his humanitarian reforms; and on it turns his teaching as to the aims and methods of Providence in its dealings with mankind. 

 This scheme is carried out by the power of God's will and it has its origin in his desire for the wellbeing of his creatures. Its aim is the training of the peoples of the world to live and to work together in harmony,  and to establish by God's particular assistance a universal civilisation in which all the human faculties shall find at last adequate and complete expression. The attainment of this goal is in the Divine Author's eyes the opening of the main movement of human history. All previous and earlier events are in the nature of an introduction. They are steps up a long ascent, causes of a desired result. 

 However important they be, their meaning lies not wholly in themselves, but in the fact that they look and lead forward to a transcendent  issue save for which they themselves would never have been called into existence. 

 Secular schools of thought cannot be said to have applied nor adopted any such broad conception of the integral unity of all human history. 

 In past times, truths so large did not find easy entrance into the minds of men. So long as accurate knowi-. edge of distant peoples was as hard to gain as accurate knowledge of past events, such doctrines would remain for scholars disembodied  and unsubstantiated ideas. Today, histories of mankind on a comprehensive scale have become numerous; yet those of them which present the complete story as having an organic plot like a well-con-structed epic, are probably few indeed. 

 In the sphere of religion, however, the case is different. 

 The idea that the course of human events is directed by a stronger will and a clearer eye than man's to a predetermined  end is found in more revelations than one. It is said to have been mentioned by the founders of all the world-religions. Though it has not been in any past age of 584

586             THE BAHA'! WORLD

  such critical interest as it is today and has not before been treated so fully as now by Baha'u'llah, yet it has never been kept wholly concealed from man. There are references to it in scripture or tradition which are clear enough to show that this truth is part of the common religious knowledge of mankind while slight enough to prove that it did not hold in any High Prophet's teaching  the same importance as in that of Baha'u'llah. 

 The general fact that God ordains human events long ages before they take shape on this earth (somewhat as a dramatist will complete his play before it is embodied in action on the stage), was alluded to by Jesus when He said of the righteous in the Last Day, "Enter into the joy prepared for you by the Father before the beginning of the world"; and again on many occasions by the Apostle Paul, as, "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world" (Eph. i. 4), and by Peter who speaks in a similar connection of "the foreknowledge of 

God the Father" (I Peter   

 i. 2) Muhammad bore the same witness when he revealed that the first thing which God created was a pen and that lie said to it, cfl~Qrrite~~ It said to him, ccx*Tht shall I write?" and God said, "Write down the quantity of every separate thing to be created." And it wrote all that was and all that will be to eternity. 

     More specifically, Zarathustra

 taught the gradual perfecting of mankind under divine law and the God-guided progress of history towards a distant but certain culmination. 

 At some unknown date the Hebrew allegory  of the creation of the world in seven days made a cryptic allusion to the procession of world-religions and to the final consummation of God's full purpose in the Seventh Day, the day of maturity, completion and rest. The seers of the Hebrew people, lifted by inspiration into the eternal realm, would descry some sign or feature of the far-off Day of God, the foreordained climacteric of world-history, and in a mood of exaltation would give utterance to their predictive vision without fully comprehending what they saw or measuring the interval which separated them from its fulfilment. Isaiah cries: "It shall come to pass in the last days that the Mountain of the Lord's House shall be established in the top of the mountains and all nations shall flow to it. They shall beat their swords into plouglishares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more" (I. 2, 4). 
                           
Or Zechariah:              

  "The Day of the Lord cometh     And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Lord and His name one" (Zech. xiv. 1, 9). 
                           
Or again Joel:             

 t~The Day of the Lord cometh there bath not been ever the like, neither shall there be any more after it even to the years of many generations. 

 Ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord that hath dealt wondrously with you I I will pour out my spirit and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy •   your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions. And also upon the servants and the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. 

 And I will show wonders in the heaven and on the earth. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and the terrible Day of the Lord come. And whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Joel ch. 2). 

  Confucius, more than five centuries before  Christ, outlined in his book, Spring and Autumn, the ordained Plan of History in brief but plain terms. 

 He divided history into three stages. In the first, which he called the Stage of Disorder,  the social mind was very crude; there was a sharp distinction between one's own country and other countries, and hence attention was paid more to conditions at home than abroad. In the second stage, the Advancement of Peace, there was a distinction  between civilized countries on the one side and those uncivilized on the other; the range of civilization extended and friendship  between nations became closer. 

 The smaller people could make their voices


<p587>
THE EPIC OF HUMANITY               587

  heard. In the third and final stage, the Supreme Peace, there was no distinction at all among the nations of the world. All became civilized and met upon the level. Righteousness prevailed and the world was unified. 
     Jesus spoke much of the   

Last Day (the Kingdom     

 of God as He usually called it) and of its near approach. C(The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." He did not stress, as Confucius had done, the historical aspect of the coming climacteric, but taking up the warnings of the Hebrew prophets He spoke of the unexpectedness of its advent and of the terrible jeopardy into which it would bring mankind. 

 Even in an age so late in history as His, a full account of the development and destiny of the race would have been premature. 

 He kept the fullness of this truth among those things which He had to say to His disciples, but which at that stage they could not yet bear. 

 But now a new occasion has arisen. New opportunities, new problems, new perils, confront mankind; and with these new conditions  has come the need of a new knowledge. 

 He who, before the human race began, fixed the date at which that yet uncreated race would reach the apex of its course and attain the maturity of its powers, has now declared that the Date has come. 

 He who, in dim and distant ages long past, solemnly ratified with His people a Covenant and made to them a faithful promise that He would bring them all to His Kingdom in His own good time, has now in this epoch kept His ancient promise and fulfilled the Covenant in its completeness. 

 This present time is God's Good time. This present time is the Era of which since the beginning of the world prophets have chanted and seers have sung. 

 Suddenly —  unexpectedly — unawares — without observation  (exactly as Jesus said) the fullness of the Glory of God has irradiated the globe from the east to the farthest west. The Day of the Lord has dawned. Keeping his pledge, God has thrown open to men a new domain of life and activity, has conferred on them new powers, laid on them new responsibilities; and he demands that they enter as quickly as may be into this new order of existence and fit themselves to these higher conditions. 

 The nature of those charges which in the Day of God are to be laid upon mankind can be gathered from a sympathetic reading of the prophets of Israel. Those seers wrote — as a great poet might write — with their minds turned towards God and their hearts lighted and warmed by ardent faith. 

 They could not control the vision that was vouchsafed them: they could not complete it nor set it in its own environment and perspective,  nor plumb its meanings nor yet count the years which should elapse before it descended from the realm in which they say it to the realm of actuality. 

 When the prophets are read in this spirit as Jesus and the evangelists read them, there rises into view a clear and boldly sketched outline of those world-developments which from the creation have been laid up to await the present hour. 

 The picture is one which has puzzled, fascinated and awed the Christian mind. The impression made by the vision upon the seer-prophets was profound. They write or chant in a strain of exaltation which finds its answer across the years in the rapturous faith of the Apocalypse and the controlled but not less deep emotion of the Christ telling of his second Advent. The strange scenes and deeds and wonders that appear in the picture are hardly more startling than the violent contrast of the colors in which they are painted. Here Hell seems to reach out to the gates of Paradise; delusion and enlightenment, despair and victory, the lighted Pit and the sunshine of God's own presence seem all to have a place here, and through some purgation of Phiegethonian misery man hardly comes alive to inherit the promise of all ages. 

 The Event which the Hebrew prophets foresaw was not to be an isolated occurrence; it was one of a series of events; it was the Last Day of many days. 

 But it so transcended all before it as to be outstanding and paramount. 

 Its splendour outshone all previous splendours, and its blessings were so far above all previous experience and precedent that men would live in a new world and would not even remember the former things that had passed so utterly


<p588>

  away. So full will be the Revelation vouchsafed by God in the Last Day, so glorious the effulgence of this supreme Theophany that darkness and error will not be able to withstand the impact of its might. 
They will flee and perish. 

 The radiance will sweep across the entire gtobe from the east to the west. 

 It will settle and abide in every land. Mankind will become one, and will be organised round a single central authority which it will recognise as divinely appointed. 

 One law will run throughout the whole earth. National distinctions will not be obliterated; the various nations will meet upon a common level but will retain their separate identity. All peoples and races will share a common relation to one another. A Universal religion will unite the hearts of all. Mankind will form a single congregation, their God being recognised everywhere as one and the same God endowed with the same attributes and known by the same Name. 

 The Glory of the Most High in its depth and in its height will be poured forth over the earth; and spiritual gifts, once the privilege of a gifted few, will be possessed by the many. 

 War will be abandoned. The skill of those who made weapons of destruction will be turned to beneficent uses. 

 All the world over, men will be able to enjoy their homes and their prosperity in security and peace. 

 (See, for instance, Isaiah ii. 24; xv. 1725;  Zech. 

 ix. 10; xiv. 9; viii, 20 flU; Zeph. iii. 9; Micali iv. 15, etc.) Such is the prophets' picture of the world conditions of the Last Day; such — believe the Baha'is — are the changes which man in this hour is called upon to make. 

 Prescient of the crisis and the difficulties that lay ahead, Baha'u'llah, half a century ago, with timely forethought, offered to mankind the knowledge that would enable them to shoulder the new responsibility about to be imposed upon them. 

 He not oniy outlined a large plan of reform, but he explained, with an emphasis, a fullness, and a precision not used before, the brotherhood of mankind and the unity of their development  from the infancy of the race to the present time. 

 History, he taught, is in its length and breadth one and single. It is one in its structure. 
It is one in its movement. 

 From the beginning of time the whole human race has been subject to one law of development'  and it has advanced age after age in accordance with one and the same principle and by the application of one and the same method. 

 Its whole movement has one source and one cause, and is directed towards one goal. The unification of the world, instead of being an afterthought, or of needing an improvised miracle for its completion, is the normal conclusion of a process that has been going on since the race began. Each of the world-religions has its own set place within this vast economy.  Each is mediated through a 

Master Prophet from God    

 by one and the same principle and bears witness to some phase of one indivisible Truth. No religion has been exhaustive or final. 

 Every one admits of development and invites it. If all were under God thus developed, each along the line of its own implicit truth, they would not move farther and farther apart, but on the contrary would approach one another till at last they merged and became one. The ultimate ideal of them all, while not the same as any one of those from which it grew, will yet be consistent with the essence of each of them. It is the universal religion: the fruit and the perfection of all that preceded it. He who accepts it on its appearance will not deny the ancient Faith of his forefathers; he will reassert it, and at the same time will accept all the other revealed faiths of mankind. 

 When all men know the certainty of their common history and their organic unity, then, said Baha'u'llah, on that knowledge will be built the temple of peace and the fabric of future-civilisation.

PRESIDENT EDUARD BENES
                  B~ MARTHA L. RooT

PRESIDENT DR. EDUARD BENES 

 of Czechoslovakia, who in December, 1935, succeeded President T. G. Masaryk, incorporates  the spirit of the young Republic in its concentration on liberty, democracy and culture in the new world order. 

 I had the honor and the privilege to have an audience with him at Hrad6any Castle in Prague, on April 22, 1936. Passing through those great reception halls in that centuries-old famous castle where kings have held sway I observed everything minutely, but when I came into the presence of this young President in his audience room, I saw oniy him. He is the living embodiment of a man with a mission, and that mission is peace. 

 He may be building greater than he knows! Certainly it was thrilling, when one hers how Baha'u'llah more than fifty years ago urged the rulers of the world to study His spiritual plan for the good of the world and the happiness of the nations, to find today in Czechoslovakia a second Ruler of this Republic who has the insight to see the significance of the Baha'i Peace Plan. 

 Also of extreme significance to readers is the historical fact that the Messages addressed by Baha'u'llah from His prison in tAkk~ to the kings and rulers of Europe —  one of whom was the monarch whose realm included this same Czechoslovakia — in 1 869 and 1870, not only declared that Universal Peace was the first obligation of governments  in this new age, but predicted the overthrow of every government resisting this ideal — a prediction that has been literally  fulfilled. 

 "President Bene~, what Jo you think of the Baha'i peace Teaching?" I asked him that morning, and he replied: "As you know, I have followed it with deep interest ever since my trip to London to the First Races Congress in July, 1911, when I heard for the first time of the 

Baha'i Movement            

 and its summary of the principles for peace. I followed it during the war and after the war. 

 The Baha'i Teaching is one of the spiritual forces now absolutely necessary to put the spirit first in this battle against material forces." 

 He has studied carefully a number of the Works of Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-BaM. He said concerning peace: "Peace is in danger todry because the spirit is lacking; in these chaotic times since the Great 'War, the fight is terrifically keen between the spiritual and the material forces. 

 Many people are convinced that the material forces are dominating and will dominate, but I have always believed that the spirit will finally win. It is always so. Jesus said, tFear not those who can kill the body but those who can kill both the soui and the body.' 

 cCTh Baha Teaching," the President again affirmed, ttis one of the great instru-meats  for the final victory of the spirit and of humanity." It is a great impulse f or-ward when true rulers like 

President Bene~, President 

 Masaryk and others begin to turn to the Baha'i Teachings to safeguard the in —  terests and promote the wellbeing of the whole human race. 

 The President spoke next of his own country and its aims for peace. One felt that Czechoslovakia is solid and sound physically and morally. He said: "'XTe have no upheavals in our country, we have tranquillity, progress without any revolutionary rights or lefts. We do not ask anything of anybody, we are nor a provocation to any one, and we attack no one. We entrust our affairs to the League of Nations in Geneva and to the World Court at the Hague. Our conscience is clear, we do not fear international judgment. 

 If we are right, it is well; if we are wrong, we shall make the corrections; that is the spirit of this country and its government."

  He spoke fervently about universal peace. His own words were: "Peace is the work of men, exactly as war is the work of men. I am of the opinion that governing people are always responsible for the wars. The responsible people in certain numbers can make the wars, or they can establish the peace.~~ Such is the President of this little nation in the midmost heart of Europe, the country  which is the balance, the counterpoise to the entire European equilibrium. He is an optimist; he told me: ~ do my best, I have a good conscience. 

 I do all I can, in such a case one cannot be a pessimist." He is a constructive pacifist, some even call him a militant pacifist in his march of ideas and tremendous efforts to establish goodwill among the nations. 

 To me he seemed neither proud, nor humble, but unconscious of his personal self he devotes his very being to his aim — and that aim is to help make a world of peace. He is most appreciative. He is most courteous; though he is such a busy man, he does not hurry, he makes each visitor feel he has time to speak. The nine men who came out from his audience chamber just before I entered it, looked very happy and in their eyes glowed the fire of the spirit. 

 He is the wisely-chosen President of an energetic nation that dwells, in its geographical  position, at the very crossroads of northern, southern, western and eastern Europe. 

Through the Baha'i Teachings

 this Republic of Czechoslovakia can become a center of the cultural currents which a new divine civilization is creating. The nations that arise to the peace ideals of this new universal cycle are those that will go forward  to the highest evolution. A half-century  ago, Baha'u'llah wrote that the presentday order would be rolled up and a new one spread in its stead; he said the most Great Peace will come. Those who have vision to see beyond the present darkness  can be optimistic, for they perceive a new world order — viewing the world as an organism — slowly but surely appearing!

SPIRITUAL PERSPECTIVES
               B~ RAYMOND FRANK PIPER

  ON rare and precious occasions the truth —  seeker attains a summit of vision so commanding  that it guides and gladdens all his lesser ways of life. He sees far; he feels deeply; he comprehends much: he stands on a peak of spacious philosophic orientation,  and locates himself on the map of existence. 

 Certain axial lines of reality seem to converge in his clear and glowing consciousness.  And from this cosmic outlook emerges a philosophic poise akin to religious peace of mind. Both are ineffable and unshakable, steadying and satisfying, a peerless harmony. This elevated experience may be called a spiritual perspective. 

 In the latter phrase I know that I am mixing metaphors and metaphysics because I purpose to show their kinship, the yoked consanguinity of poetry and philosophy. These constitute a balanced pair of wings for ascending the ecstatic heights of cosmic vision. 

 There is one distinctive kind of literature where metaphors and metaphysics abound and blend in beautiful perfection. That literature consists of the noblest utterances of the world's high prophets. Their words live on in men's hearts because they unite truth and beauty. They exhibit an equilibrium  and sense of security amid confusion and persecution the secret of which I long to know. 

 How could Buddha, Jesus, Baha'u'llah,  and others, remain calm and sweet while suffering dreadful insults and deprivations?  For some reason they were untouched  by the worldly troubles that disturb lesser minds. But how can painful troubles seem unimportant save as they are much subordinated to some large perspective? 

 What do spiritual perspectives mean in the concrete? 

 As illustrations I shall select some of the priceless vistas revealed in the writings of the Baha'i founders. 

These                     

 writings are a stirring fusion of poetic beauty and religious insight. 

 I, like another, have been CCstrucl( by their comprehensiveness."  I find they have extraordinary power to pull aside the veils that darken my mind and to open new visions of verity and life. 

 Spatial perspectives are familiar in drawing, architecture, and other arts. Before me stands a perfect example: an etching by Blanding Sloan, inscribed Two In finites, Open and Closed. From a star-set vortex at the left center burst forth two systems of seemingly endless lines. 

 Running off into the right distance an eight-way path, arched by other lines, converges tubelike at a vanishing  point in deep space whence fancy must carry on. Out of the vortex at the left originates a spiral of ever-widening light bands which leap outward toward an infinite  expansion. 

 One's imagination revels in the suggestions of boundless space in every direction. 

  This brilliant creation is a concrete symbol of an infinite concept. 

 The universal  idea of spaciousness is metaphysical: its picturesque embodiment is poetic: the two factors fuse in inseparable unity. 

 It matters little whether one says that the sense form blossoms into the idea of endlessness or that the idea of endlessness becomes incarnate  in the sense form. In such a unity is exemplified the essential meaning of a spiritual perspective. 

 It is the center of an interfiow or discharge between the two worlds of sense and of spirit. But whereas the lines of material perspective close to a point, spiritual insight opens toward the ever expanding realms of human and divine life. 

 And between the two infinites in Sloan's etching stands man, scratching his head, uncertainly balanced, puzzled, half-comic. Whenever I contemplate this comic figure, I wonder how funny I look from God's 592

  viewpoint? By way of analogy I recall a pathetic ant lost on a sidewalk and a fly beating a window pane to escape. I am eager to seize upon some cosmic perspective to redeem me from comic narrowness and futility. 

 Other kinds of perspectives exist. In arithmetic I need not count far without discovering how I could go on forever. 

 Indeed  the mathematician tells me that if I can define the relation of one term to its two neighbors, I may possess the principle of an infinite series. 

 In an analogous way, if I can determine the essence of a few drops of ocean water, I may have the key to the chemical constitution of the seven seas. Perhaps in social life certain basic relationships between neighbors can be defined which would be good for all men to practice.  Such a universal ethical principle would be another variety of spiritual perspective. 

  Are there not then some patterns of conduct, generated perhaps by a genius, which might radiate to all men, for their weal or woe? It is evident, for example, that some individual man had to be the first to smoke a pipe of tobacco else smoking could not have become a worldwide practice. 

 Here is a practical perspective of spreading conduct, of a custom which through imitation has rippled to the rims of the continents. Similarly I believe that the original example of a truly great prophet may advance from person to person until it reaches the ends of the earth. 

 Two basic characteristics of spiritual perspectives emerge from the preceding considerations.  (1) A perspective of any kind can radiate oniy from the unique viewpoint of a specific person. His viewpoint is constituted and colored — or discolored — by the values he esteems and the character of his awareness. His personal values function as a kind of eyepiece for his soul. 

 No one else can survey the world through his mental eyepiece, and he can never stand behind the window of another souL No two observers could possibly see at once the same rainbow because of their different angles of vision. Spiritual perspectives do not exist outside of personal consciousness. 

 The latter serves as a kind of focal center where values and truth become real, significant, or illUmi —  nating, just as a highly polished diamond becomes the point for the display of the inner nature and beauty of light. A spiritual  perspective produces a tremendous intensification of individual awareness. 

 (2) While several observers cannot perceive  the identical rainbow, yet comparable elements exist in all their viewpoints; for instance, an arc of prismatic colors. We can talk and think about these qualities, and consolidate them into the concept of rainbow.  Then this idea with its load of meaning  may gradually pass from mind to mind. Even big ideas which sweep like grand vistas to the horizons of reality are capable of endless recreation in the consciousness of man. 

  Thus a common realm of truth is built up in which all intelligent men may share. In the world of space only one body can occupy a given place; in the world of ideas many minds, without conflict or collision, may possess the same idea in the same instant. 

 Because ideas, entirely unlike material  things, possess this interpenetrating spiritual nature, I believe they are the greatest wonders of the world. Baha'u'llah has written, ttTherefore it has become known that the first bestowal of the Almighty is the Word. 

 The receiver and acceptor of it is the understanding. 

 It is the first instructor in the university of existence,  and is the primal emanation of God. All the names originate in His name, and the beginnings and endings of all affairs are in His hand." 1 Now a perspective is ideal or spiritual in essence. 

 It is constituted of thought or spirit. A mere animal is incapable of spiritual  perspective. 

 He cannot locate himself in any world beyond immediate sensation, nor plan his future, nor appreciate values. All these require the fourth dimension of meaningful conception which he lacks. Thus spiritual perspectives are at once unique in their personal existence and universal  in their range of meaning. 

 The two characteristics of spiritual perspectives just indicated form an intimate I.     Tablet to the Zoroastrians.


<p595>
SPIRITUAL PERSPECTIVES             595

  union. To describe this union adequately taxes to the limit alike metaphysics and metaphors. Certain spatial figures may symbolize the philosophical realities involved.  Lines focused in one point may yet radiate afar. Likewise ideas or ideals, arising in the burning focus of a finite experience, may contain revelations of vast areas of life. 

 Such an ideal or perspective as I am trying  to describe is at once personal and universal, concrete and perhaps also cosmic in bearing. Its manifestations in experience are unique, but its meaning belongs to all corners. 

 A concrete pulse of sensation is meaningless without the setting of ideas; and an idea may be vague abstraction without  the sampling of concrete reality. A spiritual perspective is an ideal incarnate in self-consciousness. 

 In converse phraseology, it is the creative form in which flesh awakens into the boundless realm of the spirit. 

 The kind of consciousness thus hinted at is what philosophers have called the concrete universal. 

 It is the kind of experience both philosophers and poets eagerly seek after; namely, the richness of actual personal life united with the breadth of ideal insight, living content illuminated by far-reaching thought, finite experience set in a cosmic perspective. 

 Only in this form does reality exist for the intelligent mind. Poetic harmony  and philosophic insight merely emphasize  different aspects of this intimate synthesis of beauty and truth. 

  The intelligent religionist, I believe, also seeks to realize this conscious fusion of the concrete and the universal. He is an expert in viewing a particuLar act in a broad setting in which God is the focus. For example, in giving a cup of refreshing water to a weary traveler he is aware of doing it in the name of the Most High. 

 Like some poets and philosophers, the religionist is cosmic in spirit and concrete in action. 

 But the truly great religionist as prophet~ reformer, while accepting both, goes beyond both in a new and important emphasis: the truth which the poet contemplates as an emotion-filled image, which the philosopher conceives as a universal principle, the prophet presents as a universal way of acting or living. Like the philosopher he possesses a secure poise born of a cosmic outlook; like the poet he clothes his convictions in beauti-Lii metaphors which inspire men. But be adds his own distinctive genius: a deep and driving urge to lead men by example to realize a richer life. Having himself discovered  the joys of a new and abundant way, he ardently yearns to communicate and share with others his unifying and generative vision. 

 In short, the characteristic quality of the religionist is a kind of missionary zeal. He is a dreamer-actor, a critic-builder, a moral leader, a creator of ethical wealth. 

 He presents  patterns of conduct which he believes, with reason and sincerity, are good for all men. 

 The greatest gift and opportunity of re-figion  is to make the patterns of abundant life attractive and effective to the masses of men, so that these ideals may gradually spread throughout the world. 

 During the remainder of this paper I shall strive to describe some attitudes or patterns of life which seem worthy of uni-versa1 practice. By suggesting ~orms which the Baha'i prophets have recommended I shall enjoy their confirmation of my selec-non. 

  It was indicated above that through the individual viewpoints of men there may permeate  some common elements of thought; for example, the color and arc of the rainbows.  The common factor consists of that mysterious marvel called the concept or idea. How is it possible for men thus to know common ideas or truths? Philosophic criticism  compels me to answer: it is the gift of one Supreme Intelligence. 

 I can find no other adequate source for the common body of verity which men know than a Divine Wisdom who in diverse orderly ways mani —  fests himself to mankind. The realization of this truth is the basic philosophic-religious insight: seeing through things to God. This awareness of the divine has been happily called cosmic consciousness. 

 The Babi'i scriptures abound in stirring metaphors by which the prophet-poets endeavor  to suggest the character of this Supreme Being. Here are a few of their


<p596>
596             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  choicest figures: God is the Ruler of existence, the Lord of all worlds, the one Foundation of 

Reality, the Shepherd      

 of the world, the Sun of Reality, the Ocean of Divine Presence, the Sea of Divine Generosity, my Awakener, the Desire of the Universe. In the invocations of these books a hundred or more stirring attributes are applied to Him. tAbdu'1-Bahi has written, ~'Nothing is completely worthy of our heart's devotion save reality, for all else is destined to perish. 

 Therefore the heart is never at rest, and never finds real joy and happiness until it attaches itself to the Eternal. Man must attach himself to an infinite reality, so that his glory, his joy and his progress may be infinite. 

 Only the spirit is real; everything else is as shadow. Therefore,  let us yearn for the Kingdom of God, so that our works may bear eternal fruit." 

 2 The deepest and surest ground of mental poise is the conviction that the framework of our human life is a friendly cosmic intelligence.  This belief, once accepted wholeheartedly, influences and glorifies our atti-aides  towards everything else. When we awaken to the perspective of a universe ordered by the ever-active and wise God, an ineffable peace takes possession of our souls. It is like the dawning of the sun over a dark and indistinct earth: the details of the landscape  fall into an ordered whole, and with joy and confidence we set forth on the next stage of our pilgrimage. In this steadying vista of existence the endpoint is God and the fore-point is my own soul, and I am content. 

  A second source of hope and peace of mind is the belief in the oneness of mankind.  This conception and ideal is the most distinctive and important feature of Baha'i teaching. 

 "The essence of the Baha'i movement," declares Horace Holley, "is spiritual democracy." In exquisite poetry Baha'u'llah has said, "0 people of the world! 

 Ye are all the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch, the flowers of one garden, and the drops of one ocean. Conduct yourselves with perfect love, union, friendship, and understanding." 

2 Divine Philosophy.       

 This belief in the oneness of mankind rests upon several solid reasons. 

 The first is religious: the conviction that God is the one Father of all entails the recognition that all men are brothers. 

 Baha'u'llah affirms, ccThe religion of God is for the sake of love and union." 

 The second reason is epistemological:  universal intercourse through ideas presupposes a deep kinship among human minds. In other words, the existence of creative intelligence and common truth makes a man realize his oneness with other members of the race. 

 The third reason is empirical and ethical. Biologically and psychologically human beings  have essentially similar characteristics. Since then I realize growth and joy through friendliness with my neighbors, it is fair to believe they would enjoy similar benefits. I take it as axiomatic that all men desire a more abundant life, and that the attitude of sympathetic goodwill enlarges our natures. It follows as night the day that the practice of goodwill — of valuing life and serving mankind — is the ultimate principle of morality. In everyday life intelligent kindness is basic; there is no demand beyond this for the regulation of conduct. 

 This ideal and spreading practice of goodwill in social relations is another example of spiritual perspective. It is of universal application. 

 It is so simple and intelligible that even a young school boy could appreciate  it. The central problem of civilization is how to extend this spirit in intelligent forms to ever-widening circles of imman beings. 

 Love is a divine quality, and the only hope of a harassed and disordered world. 

 Now suppose that every person in the world practised this attitude to every one he met, and that his sympathies excluded no one. 

 A Baha author declares, "As the laws of human association replace throughout society the laws of animal survival, men will learn how to realize the harmony, the beauty, the abundance, the free fellowship which the myths of every people have attributed to the golden age." ~ Immeasurable joy and contentment would fill the human world. 

 I could feel at home every-BahS'i: Baha'i:     Spirit of the Age, by Horace Holley, p. 127.

  where if I could expect everyone to be kind. 

 I can count upon people to prefer kindness  to ill-will and malice. 

 I know I dislike intensely the conflicts and regrets that result from unkind words and deeds. I can be sure that the psychic effects of benevolent action will be unifying and satisfying. 

 Here I come upon a second fundamental source of philosophic poise. If I can gain that inner resolution, integrity, or strength of will by which I maintain a friendly attitude at all times in the face of annoyances, injustice, or misunderstanding, then I shall have a sure refuge of peace. I rely much upon the leaders and literatures of religion to help me maintain this spirit. The power of religion to increase the deficient supply of altruism in society is a sufficient justification for its support and development in contemporary life. 

 The reign of love in the world would destroy the dullness and monotony due to unsympathetic imagination, for love is in —  genious and creative. The lover invents new devices by which to make his love more expressive and helpful. 

 Several specific techniques for realizing goodwill more effectively will now be indicated. These methods are included among the fundamental  Baha'i teachings. 

 (a) Let us consider first the art of conference, or the technique of consultation. This art of group discussion is of supreme importance in solving the problems of the oncoming century. 

 It assumes that a conference may be creative in the sense of producing  valuable insights and solutions which would not be found apart from the group. The procedure assumes the freedom, equality,  and utter tolerance of all members. It presupposes also a willingness on the part of the individual to modify his prejudices and plans of action in the light of fresh facts and ideas which may emerge in discussion. The will to maintain a spirit of unity in the group and the preservation of the method of sympathetic discussion are of such basic importance  that they must be maintained at all costs, even with the failure of agreement upon other plans of action. 

 In the ideal conference, obstruction, re-sentrnent, and secession on the part of a minority are carefully provided for. Sometimes a few, after free and full deliberation, may honestly regard the decision of the majority as unwise. 

 But every member has understood in advance the expected course of action in case he finds himself one of the imnority: namely, to maintain the spirit of cooperation and the method of experimentation; that is, in assisting the majority to gain the additional experience and facts necessary to test their hypothesis. 

 If the viewpoint of the minority should become verified, then the majority in their turn would support the minority in their plans. In this way minorities are not embittered or excluded, but are encouraged to cooperate. This consideration is of the utmost importance, because it is usually from the minority that the most significant new ideas arise. 

  To envisage the universal practice, in the different phases of social problems, of this art of conference as described above is a thrilling perspective and possibility. If this technique became as widespread as the handshake,  the ill-will, bitterness and tragedy of unsettled social conflicts would be largely alleviated. 

 To realize this lofty ideal of social adjustment requires a philosophic approach,  and a persistent and lofty order of self-sacrificing devotion to the brotherhood of man. 

 (b) Let us turn our most lively imagination  to tracing the far-reaching consequences  of another perspective concerning the brotherhood of man. Suppose that every school boy and girl in the world should learn, along with arithmetic, grammar, and other elementary studies, an international auxiliary language of excellent quality? Experts tell us that this proposal is eminently  practical, and that such a language can be learned in a surprisingly short time. Then when the school boy grew up to become  a traveler or salesman, a scientist or missionary, he could interchange ideas with people in any part of the world. 

 The result of this interchange would be the dissolution of countless misunderstandings, an increase in the sense of oneness, a mutual enrichment of cultures, and other incalculable benefits. Through such a sec

  ondary language some international body like the League of Nations could make readily available to anyone every important writing. lit seems that oniy a relatively small amount of intelligent planning and cooperation is required to inaugurate this grand enterprise. 

 Its possibilities for the growth of peace and civilization are staggering. 

 It is another spiritual perspective worthy of realization. 

 (c)     I can think of other patterns of conduct  which are at once simple in conception and universal in application. There is space to mention only a few. Baha'u'llah declared that there is no more important matter than universal peace. As soon as everyone in his heart really desires peace and is unwilling to do violence to anyone else, then war would be impossible. 

 Here is another spiritual perspective of far-reaching significance. 

 To gain peace for the world let every individual sincerely love peace and practise it. Then all hate would be turned into fellowship and love. 

 Worldwide peace is as simple — and difficult — as that. A Greek proverb says in effect: to keep our city clean let every citizen sweep his own door front. 

 (d)     Another pattern of thought of tremendous power is the idea that evil is transition to good. If everybody actually believed and acted upon that truth, then the difficulties and pains of life would lose their bitter sting and become stepping stones to higher spiritual levels. 

 The Nile River appears muddy and brown when viewed nearby; at a certain distance it becomes a sparkling blue, reflecting the brilliant sky overhead. 

 I am convinced that in general  every evil to which we do not succumb can become our benefactor if we will. 

 (e)     Here are a few other perspectives. Could not everyone in his youth learn the technique of one of the fine arts? 

 Then through the remainder of his days he could enjoy richer self-expression and development in his leisure time. (f) Why not learn in youth the simple elements of a perfected shorthand as a convenient tool for the rest of life? (g) As a lover of gardens I could propose such an organization of community and land ownership that everyone could have a small plot of earth where he could enjoy the care of growing things. 

  We have seen how a perspective is an ideal of living, seen in spirit, not yet realized in space. It is a spiritual principle capable of generating value in ever-widening ranges of human experience. 

 And those who first see and inaugurate these principles are called seers or prophets. 

 A prophet is a man who is wise enough for the first time to see and seize clearly a basic life value which future generations will esteem. 

 He discerns and lives in the present some pattern which in the course of time many nations, perhaps all the world, will practise. 

 He reads in advance the chapter  headings in the history of the future. His contemporaries may call him mad, traitorous, impious, or abnormal; he becomes the norm for people at a higher level of spiritual evolution. The masses of men are really looking for the qualities of the great normality, the complete life. 

 The peculiar function of the high prophets in all ages is to assist men in defining  the patterns of abundant life, to awaken the divine potencies which lie dominant  in them. Truth-seekers eagerly study the words of these high prophets, for they are the creators of spiritual perspectives. In Baha'i metaphor the prophet is the dawning place of goodness and spiritual truth in the world; as the sun brings light in the natural world, the prophet brings light in the spiritual world. His advent is like the coming of spring. 

 He is the patternmaker for oncoming generations. He plants in civilization the seeds of destiny, and once a seed is discovered all may grow the flower. 

 Markham has said, ~Thou canst see the whole world's winter in one leaf." In one act of unselfish love one can discern the key to universal peace and happiness. Thus the patterns of the prophets become the goals of the race, and perhaps its customs  also. 

 Because prophetic writings portray ways of life which promise to abide, the reader enjoys there in the present some of the landscapes of eternity. This sensing of the eternal brings to the mind an exquisite poise and serenity. The vision of the


<p599>
SPIRITUAL PERSPECTIVES              599

  prophets aid us greatly in finding our concrete setting in the thought lines of the ages. 

 Some of the profoundest joys of life emanate from growing perspectives concerning  its meaning. 

 James H. Cousins says, in his Ode to Truth, ttFor they who catch the vision of the whole may greatly dare the part;~~ and they who feel the power of love may live at home in all the world. Ethical and religious demands sometimes seem hard in the present because they presuppose a long-range view of a great good. The value of any perspective, however, is measured by the amount of reality it enables us to grasp, the range of future planning it provides for, and the altruistic power it generates. 

  Now it may be that the Baha'i conception  of the "new world order" is a spiritual perspective sufficiently grand to include all others. Supreme philosophic satisfaction comes from discovering such an all-compre-hensive ideal. I recall how the Parthenon is unified by imaginary construction lines which converge at a point far above the temple; so perhaps the great lines of prophetic perspective may sometime issue in a spiritual commonwealth in which God is the Pl Point" and love the universal cement among men. 

 The warmhearted devotion to such an exalted cause unifies one's whole life. 

 It saves us from the prevalent "sin of disproportion," which magnifies trifles and disregards  fundamentals. 

 In this long view the annoying details of life become negligible,  and we maintain our tranquillity amid worries and disappointments. 

 Tagore has written, ttLife's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole." 

 But, the true religionist is not, like the philosopher, merely a passive spectator of all time and existence. 

 He is a vivacious actor in a definite sphere of life. He is a pilgrim in a country which is not his own because it is not yet made according to his ideals. He lives expectantly and adventurously. He is a spiritual pioneer who dares to adopt the prophetic pattern and act upon it, as Abraham who journeyed to a far and strange land to make a new home for his family and a new religion for the world. The man of spiritual vision sees what ought to be and stakes his life on the faith that what ought to be is more real than what is for it is bound to come to pass. 

     Professor William E. Hocking

 has written,  ttDestiny in practice means the way to my next step in growth." This next step may be either one of two fundamental kinds. (a) I may become newly seized by a spiritual perspective, by an ideal which suddenly becomes transformed from a mere word or abstract idea into a soul-gripping conviction. 

 This step is a "moment of vital decision" when I claim as my own some basic prophetic ideal, when I become for the first time the burning focus of a great cosmic perspective. 

 (b) The second kind of step in growth may consist in a concrete victory in which I actually put in practice a plan of action which I have adopted as my own. And the conviction and ideal become clearer as I strive to realize them. The discovery and the realization of spiritual perspectives, then, are the two growing points of life: the seeing of a new path to a fuller life, and the starting to walk along that path. Incomparable poise and peace blesses the self whose conduct is thus oriented in cosmic perspective.

SPLENDOR AT TUE GORE
                  B~ ANGELA MORGAN

  IN the world of religion, what do the times disclose? 

 An even more exciting and significant chapter than that describing the amazing progress of science, could we only interpret it aright! 

 An identity of effort so marked, that I am sure it is not blasphemy  to declare that the scientist and the mystic, if they but knew it, are aiming at the same goal. Yes, and the iconoclast is close cousin, if not brother, to both of them! 

 How else shall we interpret the cry, which grows in strength with every year: "We want life, not empty ceremonials! Life itself is sacred, human beings in themselves  are important and their demands for justice must be heard! Give us a religion linked with life and the human cause. 

 Take God out of the church and let Him become active in the affairs of men!" 

 This healthy revolt of modern youth, seemingly against religion, is at bottom not revolt against religion but the trappings and dogma that conceal the true God. If the inner substance of religion were to be presented  to these same dissenters, I venture to predict we should find hearty agreement from all thoughtful people the world over. 

 The terrible, yawning gap between religion  and actual life is what all thinking people resent. The emphasis placed upon ritual and creed, leaving the vast problems of life to take care of themselves, creates iack of balance and breeds rebels everywhere. This agonizing divorce of the spiritual world from the actual everyday world has fostered the modern spirit known as antiChrist, and until we have bridged the formidable divide which separates the two domains of matter and spirit I fail to see how we can convince the doubter. 

  How can life be secular at one pole and divine at the other? CCAIL life is sacred!" 

 cry the dissenters. And they are right. "We are tired of this eternal prating of sin and sinners!" 

 declare the great body of resentful  youngsters — and oldsters, too —  brimming with zeal for bold and flaming adventure. They know instinctively that life itself is more important than any theory about life, and they are on their way to discover  the secret of happiness and achievement. 

 They dare the seas, ride the air, blast mountains, rear skyscrapers, build bridges, dig tunnels, and perform other amazing feats of engineering. Rivers of molten metal rush forth at their bidding; steel rails multiply and miracles of transportation unite peoples hitherto separated; excavations  in ancient lands reveal treasures of cities buried thousands of years ago. No wonder our modern age stands rubbing its eyes in the presehce of such wizardry! 

 But there is no end to the story of adventure. No sooner does man conquer the air than he challenges the stratosphere. Then, in a supreme reach of divine enterprise, he plucks a beam from Arcturus to light the Century of Progress opening in Chicago! 

 Hendrik Van Loon has written a book called: ~Man the Miracle Maker," in which the history of human achievement is fascinatingly  told, with the prediction of still greater triumphs in the future. The author declares that this volume is ctreally a confession  of faith," and shows us "Man, not as a victim of fate, but as a creature endowed with practically unlimited powers for the development of his brain Man still at the beginning of his career as a reasonable being, but rapidly discovering by which road he may eventually hope to escape from those difficulties which make his present existence such a torture." 

 It is revealing to note the author's use of a capital M in the spelling of the word "man." I am glad of it. What a change 601

  from the old and damning concept of the worm," and how refrc~hing thus to expand  one's faith in humankind! 

  In a nutshell, men are so busy with their own struggle against environment, so on fire with the will to tame the heretofore ungovernable powers of nature, that they fiercely resent interference from whatever source and fight off every seemingly inimical influence. Religion, as they understand it, is alien to their cause. 
They are in love with life!

 Dead issues do not interest them, and religion as taught in their childhood appears now an outmoded and useless superstition. 

 Everywhere we hear their protest, everywhere  we discover this revolt among human beings so deeply concerned with matter that the very word "spirit" offends them. ~'What has God to do with it?" they cry. ttWe arc interested in this phenomenal world; in the things we can see, touch and handle. 
It is all-sufficing."      

 Dear innocents, little do they suspect that God has everything to do with it and that they, all unconsciously, are acting as agents of the Creator in the very enterprises they so ardently espouse! Nor do they suspect that the forces with which they deal, the mysterious elements they handle, are in themselves divine. 

 To quote Sir Oliver Lodge, these challenging radioactive substances  we label with such assurance may some day prove to be "the very garment of God." 

 Even when our most recent revered scientists — Eddington, Jeans, Millikan and their fellow physicists — come forward with the admission that there is something beyond;  a mystery which science may not solve, the materialist remains unconvinced. But he cannot remain so forever; sooner or later he is bound to acknowledge the truth; because, whether he knows it or not, that is the direction in which he is going. 

 Why do we not see this passionate process of growth for what it is — the terrific effort of Life to throw off all impedimenta; to strip away the husk in order that the flaming reality shall appear? Life is impatient of nonessentials, and the more alive one is, the more vigorously does he insist upon reality and fight its opposite. Oh, why don't we, why can't we understand? No matter what form it takes, whether scientific or religious, the urge is primarily the same. We are, all of us, fleeing from the surface to the core, and only the core will satisfy. Out on the circumference — termed by certain  mystics "the remove," as indeed it is, being "removed" incalculable degrees from the inner reality — one confronts every conceivable  form of division; wars, hatreds, prejudices, injustice, misunderstanding, disease  and death. Only at the center can we ever find unity. 

  One reason I hail with thanksgiving the interpretation of religion known as the Baha'i Faith and feel so deep a kinship with its followers is that I recognize in its Revelation  an outreach of the Divine to stumbling humanity; a veritable thrust from the radiant 

Center of Life.            

 Every follower of this faith that I have ever met impressed me as a living witness to the glory at the heart of this universe. Bach one seemed filled with a splendor of spirit so great that it overflowed all boundaries and poured itself out upon the world here in this moment of time, by some concentrated act of love toward another human being. 

  The prediction of physicists: re The world is on the threshold of a new power era" finds justification today in the realm of religion,  which at last is placing the emphasis where it belongs, shedding the husk to make way for the blossom and the fruit. 

 Just as our men of science are flinging themselves into this terrific ttwar against the atom" in order to strip matter of its surface and compel it to reveal its inner potency, so in the churches one finds everywhere the thrust of minds bent upon preserving the fiery "cores' of religion even at the expense of ritual and dogma. Discarding formula for truth, the letter for the spirit!

E INE vergleichende Betraclitung

 ge-schichtlich  verschiedener Religionen setzt die grundsiitzliche Kiarstellung voraus, nach weichen Gesichtspunkten der Vergleich vorgenommen werden soil. Wir gehen von der Erkenntnis aus, dass alien geschichtlichen Religionen eine gemeinsarne geistige Grund —  lage cigen in. ~tDiese Grundlage muss not-wendigerweise die Wahrheit sein und kann nur cine Einheit, nick eine Mehrheit bilden." 

 1 Diese Einsicht soil gerade durch die Untersuchung des Verhaitnisses zwischen der Sendung Baha'u'llah's und dern Chris-renturn  erhuirtet werden. Die deutliche Herausstellung des Ausgangspunktes unserer vergleichenden Betrachtung dient dazu, bei der Gegenjiberstellung beider Religionen den Buck von Anfang an auf das Wesentliche mid nick auf das dern geschichtlichen Wandel Unterworfene im religibsen Ge-schehen  zu richten. 

 Wir gehen n~im1ich von dern zweifachen entscheidenden Gesichtspunkt aus, dass jeder Religion einerseits em geistig zeitloser, andererseits em zeit-und  entwicklungsge-schichtlich bestimrnter Gehalt zugrunde liegt. 

 Der erstere besteht in dem in den Heiligen Schriften niedergelegten t~Wort Gottes," das seinem Wesen nach nick ver-alien  oder erstarren kann, der letztere urn-fasst die iusseren Gesetze und Gebote, weiche immer den entwicklungsgeschichtlich gegebenen 

Erfordernissen in Bezug

Der Verf all oder die Erstar —  rung religibser Lebensformen (Dogmatis-mus,  Orthodoxie, Ausschliesslichkeitsan —  spruch) haben, wie die Geschichte zeigt, eine Verschiittung und menschliche Entstellung der gbttlichen Lehren zur 

Folge. Der Schwerpunkt     

 j eder Offenbarungsreligion liegt nicht auf ihren geschichtlichcn Daten, Ereignissen und Formen, sondern einzig und allein in ilirem inneren und unverlierbaren NVahrheitsgehalt. 

 Diesen immer wieder von Neuem zu verki~nden und von wesensf rem-den  Einfluissen und menschlichen Zutaten zu befrejen, also das ewig schbpferische Wort Gottes entsprechend der Fassungskraft und Entwicklungsstufe der Menschen wieder zu verkiinden, ist der gemeinsame Auftrag aller 

Manifestationen und Propheten.
  In der Aufeinanderfolge    

 der Manifesta-tionen  und Propheten erkennt der defer Schanende cinen wunderbaren Erziehungs~ plan Gottes fur die Menschheit, nach dem sich die geistige Entwicklung der Menschheir stufenweise vollzieht.

 ~ Baha'u'llah ruft die Mcnschen von neuem auf, die Gebote Gottes zu befolgen, weshaib Er das Wesen der Religion damit bezeichnet, "das anzuerkennen, was der Herr off enbarte und zu befolgen, was Er in Seinem m~chtigen Buck verordnet hat." Auch er wendet sich gegen erstarrte Re-ligionsformen und -Dogmen. "An diesem Tag muss den weicher das Licht der Sonne der Wahrheit sucht, semen Geist von den Ueberlieferungen der Vergangenheit frei machen; er muss sein Haupt mit der Krone der Trennung und semen Tempel (Kdpper) mit dem Kleid der Tugend schrniicken, dann wird er zu dem Ozean der Einheit und Einzigkeit Gottes gelangen. Das Herz muss von dem Feuer des Aberglaubens frei werden, damit es das helle Licht der Gewiss-heit empfangen und die Herrlichkeit Gates begreifen kann." 

 8 Er fordert die sittliche Tat als Beweis wabren Glaubens. 

 "An diesem Tag mtissen die Menschen ihrem Gott mit Reinheit und Tugenden dienen. Die Wirkung des durch den Lehrer ge-sprochenen Worts ist abhThgig von der Reinheit seiner Absicliten und seiner Tren-. nung vom Irdischen.

 Eine ausfiihrliche Kennzeichnung des Katholizismus und Protestantismus, den Haupt auspriigungen des geschichtlichen Christentums, mtissen wir uns hier versagen. Im

 steht der Anspruch der Kirche ab dem Reich Gottes und dern Leib Christi mit dem Papst, der die sichtbare Verkarperung der kirchlichen Einheit in der seit dem Vatikan-Konzij von 1870 ausgesprochenen Unfehibarkeit darstel-Len soil.

Baha'ism KAJ LA SOCIA
                      PROBLEMO

 DE PROF. PAUL CHRISTALLER, STUTTGART iama vicprezidanto de la Germana Esperanto-Asocio kaj Lingva Komitato, membro de la Esperanto-Akademio B AHMSMO estas speco de religio, kiu inter la religioj lucks sarnan rolon, kian Esperanto havas inter Ia lingvoj: gi estas netitrala kaj ne kontraiibatalas aliajn religi-ojn. 
    Nu, kio estas religio?    

 La vorto mem ci Ia latina linvo montras ankau en Ia Es. peranta formo cc bone la esencon de N ideo. Religio re-ligas homon al tiu potenco, kiun Zamenhof nomis en Ia fama kongresa pre~o CCla potenca senkorpa mistero, Ia fonto de amo, de vivo, de vero." Tiu vorto reli —  go ricevis duan i kaj fari~is religio. Mi tre gatas la sufikson " — jo" por jo tutaia: Ia tutajo de 1'fako por filozofo estas filozoflo, por astronomo gi estas astronomio, do religio estas Ia tutajo de do, kio nin ligas al tiu senkorpa mistero, kiun mallonge ni nomas Dio. 

 Bahuismo cetere ne estas nur ligo al Dio, gi sin okupas — kiel ankati aliaj religioj —  pri la individua kaj Ia socia vivoj. La soaa vivo estas portata de du kolonoj, norne: amo kaj laboro. Ni unue atentu la laboron, kiu ja estas esenca faktoro en au vivo. Baha-. 'u'lISh diris: "Plej profunden falis tiuj homoj, kiuj sur Ia Tero ne portas fruktojn, iii fakte estas kvazaii mortintoj. La plej bonaj en iu popolo estas iii, kiuj perlaboras Ia por la vivo necesan kaj uzas la gajnitajon por si kaj por la kunuloj laji amo al Dio." En Ia libro ctICit4b~i~Aqdas~~ estas postulate, ke tiu lernu iun profesion kaj per gi akiru viv-rimedojn, kiujn Ii uzu por Ia propra bono kaj por tiu de aliuloj. 

 Oni rajtas havi privatan posedajon kaj labore akiritan hava-jon.  Baha'u'llah diris: "kiam homo fariftis memstara kaj matura, tiam Ii bezonas Inn-staton;  estas 1a~dinde, kiam tiu bonstato estas akirita per metio-aii alia profesio. Tatiga impostado devos zorgi, ke la riaajo de u~-uopulo  ne farigu tro granda; kio kondukus al malbona stato de socio. 

 Same devas entre-prenisto aii fabrikestro partoprenigi siajn laboristojn en 'a profito de 'a entrepreno, per tio oni instigas al laboremo kaj evitas strikojn." 

 Taiiga impost-lefto lasus impost-libera mairiCulon, sed, ph multe ol nun, pagigus ri&ulon. La bah~a instruo rekornendas na-turaj-imposton, kiu estas liverata de kampo-teritorioj  al urbaj distriktoj. ttEkzemple: kampulo kulturas la grundon kaj produktas nutrajojn, cliii Ia urbo ricevu dekonon. En la urbo estu konstruata komuna don-io, en kiun oni metu ~iujn kampo-produktajojn. Se iu en la urbo estas senhelpa, oni al ii donu Iiajn dutagajn bezonajojn. Kampulo, kies enspezo nur sufleos por propra nutrado kaj bezonajoj, devos esti impost-libera. 

 Sc aliflanke rieulo nur bezonas 50 kg da pro-duktajoj kaj ii posedas 50,000 kg, Ii post pago de eiuj siaj kostoj estu impostata je du dekonoj, kaj je Ia fino de 1' jam ejo, kio restas, cstu donata en Ia domon por ftenerala bezono." 

 Pri Ia reguligo de Ia salajra problemo Baha'u'llah rekomendas, ke Ia oficistoj kaj laboristoj ne nur ricevu salajron, sed ankail profitu 4 Ia gajno: ttPosedanto de kapitalo, minejo kaj fabriko dividu siajn enspezojn kun siaj labor-prenantoj, t.e. Ii donu al iii la~-mezuran rentumon, tiei ke iii ricevu krom sia salajro join el la ftenerala enspezo, por ke ilia animo kun plena intereso parto-prenu en Ia entrepreno. Tiamaniere oni estonte ankafi ne plu starigos trustojn. 

 La trusta problerno perfekte malaperus. Fabri-610

  kantoj, kiuj havas 10,000 partumojn, donos cliii du-mil al siaj laboristoj kaj skribe cer —  tigos don al iii. La resto apartenas al la kapitalistoj. Poste, je fino de 1'monato ati jaro post depreno de la sumo por salajroj kaj bezonajoj oni dividu la profiton laji la nombro de la partumoj." 

 Tia reguligo alti-gos  Ia laborernon de unuopa oficisto kaj laboristo kaj savos la popol-ekonomion de la detruaj strikoj. C~jj~ registaroj de 1'mondo unuigu kaj organizu kunvenon kies membroj estu elektataj de la parlamentoj kaj la noblu-loj  de 1'~tatoj. 

 Tiuj per plej granda sa~eco kaj energio realigas 'a projekton tiel, ke nek Ia kapitalistoj havu maiprofiton, nek la la-boristoj  farigu malri~aj kaj mizeraj CCcjj~j registaroj devas farigi protektantoj de la Ic legoj, ~ar strikoj ejam kaiizas detruon, sed legoj estas katizo de vivo. Legoj devas esti donataj, postuloj nur estu farataj inter-konsente kun legoj kaj ne per striko, per-forto  kaj sen-indulgo." 

 La fundamentoj de eiuj sociaj statoj estas spiritaj: iii devenas el koro kaj spirito. Tial diris 'Abdu'l-Baha: (CLa malsano, kiu tur —  mentas la kornunumon, estas manko de arno kaj foresto de altruismo. Sen amo kaj kon-kordo  neniam estos progreso ati prospero." 

 Amo do estas la dua kolono, kiu portas la socian vivon. 

 Ekzistas konata vorto ccpregu kaj laboru," mi opinias, oni ~ samsence ankaii din; ttamu kaj Iaboru," aar Ia plej bona interrilato kun Dio estas certe, kiam oni helpas jel al liaj gefiloj sur la Tero. 

 Staris jam du arnikoj antafi ruino de monaliejo, unu el iii diris: jen ruino, .5ar oni tie ne sekvis Ia principon: "pre~u kaj laboru," oni nur pregis kai ne laboris; venos la tempo, kiam nunaj fabrikoj ankafi estos ruinoj, ear en iii oni nur laboras kaj ne pre-ftas.  Lu Ia nuna stato de kelkaj fabrikoj ne jam verigas dun diron? Kompreneble mi per Ia jus dirita ne volas din, ke ne ekzistis kaj ekzistas monaliejoj, kie oni kontentige laboris kaj laboras, kid ankati ekzistas fabri —  koj, kie oni preftas afl aplikas amon, kie ne nur Ia profitemo de la entreprenanto regas, kie la dungitoj partoprenas Ia profiton lag la konsilo donita de Baha'u'llah jam antaii multaj jardekoj. 

 Ni revenu al Ia amo, efektivigota per Bahiismo. Tie oni zorgos kaj zorgas jam en bahiaj komunumoj por la malrieuloj. 

 En du bahaa komunumo komitato kun almenail nati membroj havas la taskon, zorgi pri la bono de Ia kornunumo kaj de la unu-opuloj.  Tiu komitato estas nomata de Baha'u'llah  "Domo de Justo." di decidas pri malfacilaioj estigintaj inter membroj de 1'komunumo; &f a tasko estas 'a zorgo pri bona edukado. Al kelkaj religioj oni jam riproeis, ke iii estas kontra~ klerifto de la ~ ear tiel la pastraro povas ph facile regi kaj gvidi sian ~afaron. En BahAismo kontra~e, kie ja ne ekzistas pastraro, oni tre multe atentas kierigon kaj bonan edu-kadon.  Ju ph homo evoluigas sian inte-lektajn  kapablojn, des ph ii proksimi~as al Dio. Tial estas unu devo por gepatroj, doni al siaj infanoj edukadon kiel eble plej bonan, kaj tiu devo validu al knaboj kaj knabinoj; estas ee dirite, ke, kiam la rimedoj ne sufiaus, oni ph klerigu Ia knabinojn, ear iii estos la edukantoj de la venonta genera-cio.  Se iuj gepatroj maizorgas tiun devon pri eduko, dam la Dorno de Justo intervenu, kaj kiam la rimedoj de Ia gepatroj ne sufi~as, la Domo de Justo subtenu. tar, kiel estas dirate en la Kitab-i-Aqdas: "La Domo de Justo estu rifugejo por malriauloj kaj sen-hejmuloj."  Abdu'l-Baha. 

 en siaj leteroj ~iam denowe akcentis, kiom necesa estas la bona instruado al la knabinoj ~ar iii estonte povos konsiderinde inilui celadojn, necesajn por Ia bono de la socio. La Domo de Justo devas aparte atenti malzorgitajn infanojn, kiuj facile farigas krimuloj, gi devas zorgi pri konvena familio ail instituto, en kiu iii estu edukataj. 

 Ankaii pri servistoj kaj servistinoj la Domo de Justo estas repondeca. Unu ella diroj de Baha'u'llah estas: cebenata estas Ia princo, kiu asistas malliberulon, Li riaulo, kiu helpas mizerulon, Ia justulo, kiu zorgas, ke subpremito sperm juston, kaj ~iu, kiu plenumas, kio estas al ii ordonita de Ia Eternulo." 

 Estis la ideo de Baha'u'llah, ke estonte Ia institucio de Domo de Justo estu aplikata por tuta urbo, por tuta popolo. 

 La Kitab-i-Aqdas ankaii instruas pri Ia enspezoj de Domo de Justo. En tiu komu-numo  estu deponejo, kiu ricevu la enspezojn. La unua enspezo estu dekono ci la havajo de unuopuloj, dua venos el Ia brutoj, tria el Ia mineraloj: de Ciu minejo unu triono iru al tiu deponejo, kvare: se iu mortas sen

  heredantoj laii-legaj, ha postlasajo iros en la generalan deponejon, brine: se jo estas trovita sen-mastra, ~t estos metata en la deponej on. Se iu farmisto havas elspezojn same gran-dajn,  kiaj estas liaj enspezoj, ii ne pagu im-poston;  alia farmisto eble havas elspezojn, ni diru mu dolarojn, kaj ha enspezo estas 2,000 dolaroj, de tia homo dekono estos postulata, aar ii havas pluson. 

 La orfoj, knpluloj, malri&uloj, eiuj estos prizorgataj ci 'a deponejo. Pluso en Ia enspezoj iras al 'a nacia trezorejo. 

 Tial estas Ia instruoj de Bahiisrno rilate al Ia socia vivo. Kiam ni pripensas jim, ni trovos, ke ilia esenco estas enhavata en La instruo de Ia kristana reiigio, ear ai~ ~-havas  la ordono: "amu vian proksimulon kid vi mem," kaj: cckion vi deziras, ke aliaj faru al vi, sam-don faru vi al iii." La joma diferenco inter 'a du instruoj estas, Lie la bahia estas ph detala, oni povas din: ph nuntempa, iii bezonos eventuale §an~ojn, ham aijigas la cirkonstancoj en Ia socia. Tion akali esprimis la fondintoj de la ba-Ma  movado, dirante, ke &iu nova profeto kaj instruanto de la homaro instruas don, kio estas tatiga por la tempo, en kiu ii agas, kaj por Ia homoj, kiujn eduki ii estas sendita. 

 Facile oni demandos, du la ph bona es-tonto,  kiun revis la fondintoj de 1'Bahiismo, iam reali~os? 

 Tamen, kiam ii konsideras, ke ekzemple en Persujo kiu estas la lulilo de Bah6isrno kaj ide ties ideoj estas tre konataj, tiuj ideoj multe influis la nunan ph bonan staton en tiu lando, kvankam N baManoj sin detenis de 6iu politika agado, darn in povas esperi, ke ankati en aliaj landoj pros-peru  kaj venku tiu nobla celado. Ciu-kaze: celado al bona idealo havas rekompencon en si mem, kaj por ni validas ankafi la Zamen-hof  a devizo: 'tNi laboru kaj esperu!"

BAHA'U'LLAH'S GROUND PLAN
               OF WORLD-FELLOWSHIP AS
              PRESENTED BY 'ABDU'L-BAHA

 A sketch based on "tAbdu'1-Bahi in London" and "Talks by Abdu'l-Baha in Paris" 

                B~ GEORGE TOWN SHEND

THE Ground Plan of World   

 Fellowship which is now submitted to your consideration was composed out of the writings of Baha'u'llah and presented by cAbdui1~Bahi in London, and later in Paris, about a quarter of a century ago. It proposes in the simplest possible form a practical scheme for mastering the urgent problem of world-fellowship; and its originating idea, though of outstanding magnitude, is such as to place the whole plan from its beginning throughout in complete accord with the purpose we have before us today — that of promoting the spirit of fellowship through the inspiration of religion. 

 This Plan in every feature plainly implies that nothing less than a concerted effort on a world scale, with the spiritual energies of mankind informing its practical energies, will now suffice to awaken the spirit of fellowship and secure deliverance from danger. No local or regional effort; no partial effort of either religion alone or statecraft alone, will completely solve our problems. The sense of fellowship (to be adequate to this unique emergency) must be broad, based on the whole of our human nature (spiritual, moral and intellectual) and not limited by any terrestrial boundaries. 

 Such a thesis may still be ahead of the public opinion of mankind. But it is not so far ahead of that opinion as it was when it was first proposed in this city in 1911. Today our emergency is rather more serious than then; but it is of the same general character. 

 What then and up to the present  has been lacking in men's experiments is clearness of spiritual vision, the guidance of intuition. Only Faith can point or see the way in such an hour as this. 

 Men question  the love of a God who could let loose on them so dire a cataclysm and could choose out this generation for suffering wholly unprecedented. 

 Their doubt cuts them off from the source of light and help. There is no vision; and the people perish. Only Faith sees clearly — in open view —  that this darkness is cast by a great light, that this passing defeat of the spirit of FeY-lowship is the prelude of its final victory. A loving God would not have set this generation problems without bestowing the ability to solve them, would not inflict dire penalties on those whom he regarded as guiltless. 

 We are daunted by the strange new troubles that close us in on every side; we do not look within and observe that a new power of mastering these is being developed in conscience and in spirit. Intellectual vision never was so keen as in this generation;  but spiritual vision, was it ever more weak? We talk — we boast — of the New Age; but we miss its greatest gift. N('e say the human race is at last reaching maturity,  but we do not realise the fuiness, the completeness of this growth. We perceive  it is intellectual; we do not perceive it is, in like measure, moral and spiritual. Man's conscience has become more sensitive, his spirit more responsive to heavenly promptings. 

 As he is today endowed with a new degree of intellectual power, so is he endowed today with a new degree of re 614


<p615>
BAHA'U'LLAH'S GROUND PLAN           615

  ligious power. The evolutionary process with even hand bears onward the whole being and nature of man; his heart as well as his brain. 

 New ideals, new hopes, new dreams of further progress, a more general, more insistent desire to build a better world than that one which we inherit — these bear witness to man's consciousness of growth. In all its faculties the human race is passing from childhood and ignorance towards maturity, towards the tasks that befit full manhood. Today mankind is like a youth leaving school for the sterner world of business and affairs. It is called on to put into practice the lessions of moral principle and human fellowship in which it has been instructed for so long. For how many centuries  have we — all of us — been under tutelage to those whom we revere as the Founders of our Faiths? Is it strange a time should come when we should be required to put into concrete deeds the precepts of brotherhood we all acknowledge and should at last be threatened with condign punishment if we disobey? 

 Much indeed has been done of late to remedy old wrongs, to suppress tyranny, to uplift the oppressed, to relieve the poor, to teach the ignorant. 
But how much remains undone!

 We have accomplished enough to convict ourselves of being fitted for a better social order, of being ready to inaugurate a system of widespread justice and fraternity — and of lacking the resolution to put our ideals into effect. There is enough of good in our recent record to incriminate us —  but not enough to deliver us. We stand now before the judgment seat of heaven condemned by the evidence of our own acts. 

 We had no Vision: Men turned from saints, mystics, seers, and listened to secular philosophers. 

 Blind leaders of the blind, into what perdition have they led us! Our intellectual  eminence by some fatality heightened our troubles. Divorced from faith, it aggravated human pride, taught men to forget their moral responsibility and to deny their servitude before the moral law. The inevitable hour of retribution draws near. 

 Surely this is a love-tragedy vaster in its scale, more terrible in its poignancy than any in the history of our race! 

 The urge of evolution pressed us f or-ward; we would not go. The spirit of fellowship grew warm in our hearts; we would not feed its flame. The gates of world-brotherhood opened wide; we turned away~ God poured His Spiritual bounties on spirit and conscience in greater abundance than ever; we in our blindness rejected His gifts and Him. 

 But this failure is not final nor for long. It is not the failure of Faith, nor yet of Love. 

 It is the open, the confessed failure of human wisdom. 

 Through its purgation men who have doubted will learn to turn for fellowship and peace to the way they have not trodden; the way of religion. 

 But all must tread this way together. Since the whole world as a unit is involved, the ideals which are to guide this movement must be given a definite shape. 

 If there is to be concerted action towards a single goal, some map of the common journey must be made. Vague sentiments of goodwill, however genuine, will not suffice. Some explicit agreement on principles will be required for any coordinated progress. 

 It was to this task that Baha'u'llah long ago addressed himself, and worked out a Ground Plan on which the temple of human fellowship might be reared. It consisted of a set of fundamental principles and represented the minimum of what the occasion  required. No foundation iess deeply dug than this will hold the structure that is to be built upon it. The burden of the whole scheme was laid ultimately upon the shoulders of each individual  man and woman. Everybody by vir-ture of his status as a human being had his share in the vast world enterprise. 

 The principle of individual responsibility was thus to be the basis of all progress. 

 But underneath this basic fact of human duty lay something deeper yet. 

 The living rock on which this foundation was to be laid was something the strength of which humanity hitherto has too little recognised. That rock is the Truth. This spirit of fel —  lowship which we seek to encourage is not by RaM'u'llAh conceived as some addition to being which the genius of man should undertake to create. 

 As a flower within the bud, it lies waiting the hour of its appear

  ance. It is a reality which our fraginentari-ness denies. And what this Assembly desires to do is not to create something new but to give expression to something which is already in existence though unused. 

 Man s advancing power is due to his increasing knowledge of truth; and the magnificence of this present age bears witness in the last resort not to the personal greatness of this generation but rather to the greatness of a continuously unfolding Truth. If this Age is to become the Age of Universal Brotherhood, it must be the Age of Knowledge (Knowledge of Truth). The Truth will set us free. The Truth will make us one. 

 As the first item of his programme, therefore, Baha'u'llah claimed that every individual  should have the right of seeking for himself the truth. 

 Love of truth (which at the present time is growing apace among mankind) is the sole real corrective of all forms of error and illusion. The great enmities  which in the past have divided mankind, and which were due to misunderstanding  and ignorance, have in recent times lost their vitality, and our estrangements are now due chiefly to prejudice. These prejudices have come down to us from the past —  racial, religious, national — and the instinct of imitation. 

 For them all Baha'u'llah offers one radical cure — the search for truth. The battle which mankind yet has to fight between  prejudice and truth he seems to regard  as the Armageddon of the human soul. 

 Through this search for truth mankind at last wbuld become really and clearly conscious  of the essential unity of the human race. For this unity is and has ever been a fact. "Ye are the leaves of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. 

 Deal ye with one another with the utmost love and harmony, with friendliness and fellowship," wrote Baha'u'llah.  From the full knowledge of this unity, and from nothing less, there would be born in this age a spirit of world-fellow-ship  adequate to the present emergency. 

 On this consciousness of unity, therefore, tAb~ du'1-Bah~ laid the greatest stress. He gave to it a central place in his programme, other features supporting or amplifying it or giving  it application in the practical affairs of mankind. 

 One of the facts which has obscured from men's view their essential unity is the difference between the world-religions, which has been made the cause of estrangement —  of prejudice and even of ill-will and strife. But, insisted tAbdu'1-BaM there is nothing in these differences which should produce so sad a result. 

 Indeed, there is an important aspect in which all religions are at heart one; and he included the existence of this unity as a principle in his scheme. He meant (so it seems) that a religion does not consist solely of a doctrine, and an institution,  but is also in a real and vital sense a spiritual atmosphere. It is, as he once described  it, "an attitude of soui towards God, reflected in life." This the essence of true religion; and to this extent, the whole world over3 members of all the religions have an outlook, an experience, an obligation which they share in common with one another in spite of their special and distinctive loyalties,  and which groups them all together apart from the sceptic. 

 The more intensely spiritual men are, the more vividly Conscious are they of the reality  and sweetness of this communion, and one of their privileges is the experience of a deep sympathy, a common lowliness, a common aspiration which they share with those of a different tradition from their own. 

 Not oniy in their atmosphere, their influence,  but even in their profounder teachings the world-religions may show forth this unity. 

 Do na all our faiths affirm and magnify the iove of God for His creatures? What truth could be more ancient, more precious than this? 

 What would bind those who espouse it with a closer tie of fellowship? 

 This age of widening consciousness and deepening love of truth has begun to bring us, on a scale quite unprecedented, some accurate knowledge of the sacred treasures and the sacred history of the human race. Scholars, divines, men of letters, poets have all contributed to this enlightenment. 

 They show us each of the great religions as being like a majestic temple reared in some chosen spot by the hand of a master architect, and surrounded now by a multitude of lesser buildings of various later dates. Each temple blends with its own environment but


<p617>
BAHA'U'LLAH'S GROUND PLAN             617

  is in marked contrast with all the other temples. 

 No two are alike, and the annexes connected with each are still more unlike. But if the enquiring traveler pursues his investigations and makes his way within the sacred structures he discovers in their several interiors and even in the shrines themselves an unmistakable kinship in beauty. 

 Experts in comparative religion have spoken with emphasis of the points of agreement  to be found between the world religions. 

 Professor Cheyne quotes Max Muller as advising the Brahn-iists to call themselves Christians" and himself argues that the reconciliation  of religions must precede that of races Ccwhich at present is so lamentably incomplete." 

 The evidence of men of learning  is supported by that of another cloud of witnesses, whose testimony none can gainsay, and who speak with the voice not of intellectual  criticism but of spiritual knowledge. The highest exponents of a religion, those who understand most thoroughly its meaning and interpret its spirit with the most compelling authority, are those men and women of mystical genius whose impassioned  devotion and obedience to their divine Master is the outstanding feature of their lives. 

 If each of these religions were strictly exclusive, the negation of all the others, bringing to men its own irreconcilable message,  in that case those who follow these religions to the extreme, the mystics and the saints, would assuredly move further and further apart, and would come to rest at the last point of divergence. The greater the saint the wider the gulf between him and the saints of alien allegiances. 

 At the same time the iess aspiring and spiritually gifted multitudes, immersed in the daily human concerns which all men share alike, would be found to be the least estranged from one another by their differing creeds. 

 But in fact this is not so. Strangely, very strangely, religious history shows us something  quite different — exactly the opposite. The contrast between each world-religion and all its sister — religions is as a rule felt most acutely and insisted on most vigorously by the less mystically minded of its votaries. While the mystics of all the religions instead of moving further and ever further apart seem rather to travel by converging paths and to draw nearer and nearer together. 

 If one is to accept the account of their experience given by contemporaries or by themselves, these mystics seem all the world over to have gone upon thu same spiritual adventure, to be drawn onward by the same experience of an outpoured heavenly love; and they testify one and all that to reach this knowledge of the love of God is to understand at last the mystery and the hidden  blessedness of life and to possess an everlasting treasure for which the sacrifice of all earthly things is but a little price. 

 This fellowship among all mystics is common  knowledge, of which evidence is within the reach of all. In a wellknown 

English work, Miss Underhili

 writes of the mystics that — "we meet these persbns in the east and the west; in the ancient, mediaeval, and modern worlds. Their one passion appears  to be the prosecution of a certain spir itual and intangible quest.     This, for them has constituted the whole meaning of life     and it is an indirect     testimony to its objective actuality that whatever the place or period in which they have arisen, their aims, doctrines and methods have been substantially the same. Their experience therefore forms a body of evidence, curi-ousiy  self-consistent and often mutually cx-planatory. 

 Every public library in this country will contain books supplying illustrations of this statement. The mystical outlook and perspective both on the things of heaven and the things of earth is in its essence eternally the same. But perhaps no instance of the fundamental unity that underlies all mystical experience is more striking than that parallelism between Plotinos and St. Augus —  tine to which in his "Evolution of Theology"  Professor Edward Gaird draws atten-non. 

 ~tSome of the finest expressions of this (the mystical) attitude of soui," he writes, "may be found in the Confessions of St. Augustine. 

But when St. Augustine     

 expresses  his deepest religious feelings we find that he repeats the thoughts and almost the very words of Plotinos." Professor Caird then shows how closely akin to the thought 1 Introduction to Mysticism, 

Chapter 1.


<p618>
618              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of Plotinos is "that great passage in which Augustine gives an account of his last conversation  with his mother Monica about the life of the redeemed in heaven." And he concludes tthow deeply neo-Platonism must have sunk into the spirit of St. Augustine when in describing the highest moment of his religious experience he adopts almost verbally  the language in which Plotinos tries to depict the mystic ecstasy of the individual  soul as it enters into communion with the soul of the world." 

 By what diverse paths have mystics who had nothing in common save wholehearted servitude before the one loving God, by what diverse paths have they all alike attained the blessed Presence! 

 And what man in his pride of opinion will shut out from Paradise those whom God's own hand has admitted? 

 Thus do scholars and saints join to testify that the great religions have their aspect of unity as well as their aspect of variety, and that without qualifying their special allegiance worshippers in all religions may find something in the fundamental nature of religion itself which promotes a sweet, precious and abiding sense of true companionship. 

 The promotion of a boundless spirit of concord and good will Baha'u'llah maintained to be agreeable to the genius of every world-religion. 

 Whatever misunderstanding may have arisen in bygone centuries, no religion as originally taught was meant to encourage animosity. 

 Quite the contrary. Religion is vieant to heal discord. 

 So important  in an age of disintegration did this feature of religion seem that tAbdu'1-Bahi proposed to include in his Plan the precept that "the purpose of religion is to promote harmony and affection.~~ One will not doubt this loving purpose may be discovered, or rediscovered, in every one of our world-faiths, and assuredly in Christianity. 

 If we look away from Christendom to Christ and to the pure teaching of Christ, we find it evident throughout the Gospels. Christ said that one's whole duty was to love God and one's neighbor, and he described neighbor as meaning anyone  you could help regardless of creed or kin. He made fellowship in love the evi~ dence of Christian membership "by this shall all men know that ye are My disciples if ye have iove one to another." 

 In this Age we congratulate ourselves that for centuries past religious enmity has been continually growing more weak. Yet our ideal remains negative. To manifest no ill-will towards those who differ in opinion from us is not enough. Christ enjoined a more positive attitude of soul; one of active goodwill despite all differences. When God thus commands a spirit of ~ffection towards all, he gives the power to obey His command.  Religion, in other words, is creative. Through its force the will of an earnest man is enabled to achieve an inward change that otherwise would be beyond his strength. If this were not so, what useful place would religion fill in this cosmos of ours? 

 If now the creative power of religion to effect this purpose were called upon and put to vigorous use, how many vital problems which have proved insoluble on the intellectual plane (such as the reunion of Christendom or the combating of secularism) might prove much more tractable when carried to the spiritual plane! 

 Another effort at harmonization was called for when Baha'u'llah included in this scheme an active partnership between religion  and science. 

 Tolerance between the two is too little. In their nature they are complementary, as two wings with which the soul soars towards knowledge of the truth. Science divorced from religion gives a wholly distorted view of reality. Religion divorced from science may become a mere superstition. 

 Man is to use both as his servants and thus to bring the material aspect of life and the spiritual aspect at last into evident and complete accord. 

 To these principles Baha'u'llah added (as necessary for practical results) certain provisions  of a more material nature. tAbdu'1 Baha mentioned laws to prevent extremes of indigence and opulence; universal education, a common language, a central 

World-Tribunal.            

 To the use by all nations of a secondary or world language in addition to their mother tongue great importance was attached; without this device fellowship would never be assured. The religious his


<p619>
BAHA'U'LLAH'S GROUND PLAN             619

  tory of mankind from the days of Babel to the present bears out this emphasis. 

 'When we remember, for example, the influence of the general use of the Greek language throughout the Roman Empire at the beginning  of our Era, when we consider how in BUm the adoption of Arabic as a common  language united peoples hitherto tranged, facilitated the interchange of thought and aided the rapid extension of a single culture over vast regions; or when again we observe how the cause of ecclesiastic  unity was promoted by the use and weakened by the disuse of the Latin language as a medium among the peoples of western Europe centuries ago; we are driven to conclude that in this age of radio and aviation a world-language would unify the peoples of mankind to a degree unprecedented  in the past and difficult for us to calculate in anticipation. 
     The federal tribunal or    

Board of Arbitration      

 which in a few words tAbdu~1Bahi proposed differed in three notable points from the League which afterwards was set up. The provision of an adequate police force was an essential prerequisite: the draft of any proposed constitution was to be referred  not only to the governments but also to the peoples of the world: when finally ratified and adopted, it was to enjoy the full support of religion, of church as well as of state, and its strict maintenance against any violation by any nation was to be held by all mankind as a sacred obligation. 

 In these and all other reforms man's greatest stay would be the Holy Spirit, without whose aid no peace or fellowship or unification would ever be secured. 

 This scheme of world-fellowship was presented  twenty-five years ago in London by tAbdu~1~BahA out of teachings first promulgated  some forty years before. "This," he said "is a short summary of the teachings of Baha'u'llah. To establish this Baha'u'llah  underwent great difficulties and hardships.  He was in constant confinement and he suffered great persecution. But from the darkness of his prison he sent out a great light into the world." 

 (tAbdu~1~BahA in London, p. 18.) Abdu'l-Baha claimed that these principles were consistent with the spirit of all the world religions and were measured with exact and unique fitness to mankind's heightened capacity and its tremendous responsibilities at this time. He had no doubt of their being at no very distant  date adopted: fellowship along these lines was the birthright of our New Age. But though they have percolated far through the world and have cheered the hearts of many with renewed hope, yet the large collaboration between races and religions here so definitely 5tlined has in fact been postponed in favor of narrower views and materialistic reforms. Our civilization is in desperate plight and has sunk into a moral and spiritual abyss. 

 Men realize the urgent need of a reformation greater in range and in intensity than mankind has ever yet achieved but know not how to meet it. In such an emergency does not this bold original scheme of fellowship merit serious consideration and even the test of experiment. 

 Does it deserve to be merely ignored by the rulers and the teachers of the world? 

 In advocating peace to a western audience tAbdu~1~Bah& once said, "You have had war for thousands of years; why not try peace for a change? If you do not like it, you can always go back to war." 

 One might in such an hour as this hazard the same suggestion  about this ground plan of fellowship: we have exhausted a hundred other devices to no purpose — why not try this? If we do not like it, we can always return to our present-condition.

DIE BAHA'IS UND MEINE
                     ERFAURUNGEN

 B~ PROF. J. RYPKA N OCH heute, nach rnehr als vier Jahren, kann ich mich meiner ersten Beriihrung mit dern militanten BaM'ismus ganz genau erin —  nern. Es hatte mir einer meiner Kollegen auf nitein Universit~itskabinett telephoniert, dass cine amerikanische BahA'i-Sendbotin mich zu sprechen wiinscht. 

Auf meine Entgegnung      

 hin, dass ich ftirwahr keine Lust in mit versptire, mich mit phantasti-schen LuftgelMiuden, die mir iiberdies durch meine 

Studien kein Geheimnis    

 sind, abzu-geben,  meinte er sehr ernst, die Ansichten, die er soeben gehart babe, sejen gar nick so grundlos; im Gegenteil, em durchaus ver-niinftigcs  und anhdrbares Credo, dem ich doch bei dieser Gelegenheit etwas Aufrnerk-sarnkeit  widmen solite, zumal es in mein Forschungsgebiet einschhigt. 

 Als es em zwei Tage darauf wirklich zur Entrevue karn, leitete ich so gut wie mit dem HThdedruck gleichzeitig das GespiKich mit einer vielleicht etwas hochnasigen Be-merkung em, mir wiire die BaM'i-Doktrin aus der gelelirten Literatur gentigend be-kannt.  Und ich wiirde mich bis zur Stunde schiimen, h~itte ich damals es unterlassen, zur Bekr~iftigung j ener Bewillkomrnnung sogleich verschiedene orientalistische Werke zu zitieren. Miss l4artha Root schrieb mir meine Kenntnisse an tmiitig und unver-drossen zugute. Ihre unverwiisdiche Lie. benswhrdigkeit hess sich dadurch weder krThken noch stdren. Deswegen gab es kein Zeremoniell der sich zum ersten 

Male Be-gegnenden.  Vielniiehr

 nahrn unser GesprThh nach einer derartigen gegenseitigen Kennen-lernung  unverweilt das Gesiclit einer lang-j~ihrigen besten Freundschaft. 

 Miss Martha Root entwickelte vor mir ihre Ziele und Plilne, sie zeigte mir verschieden-. sprachige 

Literatur des Bah6flsmus  

 und ich begriff aisbald, dass ich denn doch nicht so dies wusste, wie ich es anflinglich vermeint hatte.. 

 Ich wiirde meine damaligen M~inge1 heute folgendermassen bestimmen: Hier trat mir das Leben entgegen, wohingegen all meine Kenntnisse nur nach 

Papier rochen. Der Professor

 wurde unbewusst und unwill-kiirlich  zum Schiiler. 

 Er sah nick mehr das Phantastische, das sich in Buchstaben und Ziffern ergeht, sondern eine erhabene reli-gibse Lehre mit weitgreifenden soziolo-gischen  und wirtschaftlichen 

Auswirkungen.             

 Miss Martha Root entging mein Interesse fur Iran und das Ir6nische niclit. 

 Ebenso nachte hinweder ich im Laufe unseres Ge-spr~chs  die mir uns~g1ich sympathische Ent-deckunk, dass Miss Martha Root Persien, das Land des Lbwen mit der aufgehenden Sonne, aus Autopsie kennt. 

 1st es verwunderlich, dass unserer ersten Begegnung aisbald eine zweite und weitere folgten, zu deren nun audi meine Frau herangezogen wurde? Immer mehr erfuhren wir fiber den gegen-w~irtigen  Stand des BaM'ismus, seine 

Beweg-ung  und Organisation.
Nach alien Schil-derungen 

 schien CS flUfl, dass es kinderleiclit sern muss, 10.000 Meilen in Persien zu machen, sobald man einige Bali' is zu semen Freunden zThlt oder in Ermangelung dessen bloss iiber em 

Empfehlungsschreiben      

 vet-fiigt.  Ms. Martha Root braclite Cs zuwege, das ich in kurzem Mr. und Mrs. Howard Carpenter, die auf ihrer Reise nach Persien f fir einige Zeit in Wien haltgemacht hatten, begegnen konnte. 

 (Dafi~r wie fur gar so manches bin ich ihr noch heute innigst dankbar.) 
Dies war meine zweite     

BahA'i-Bekannschaft.      

 Ich kehrte nich entt~iuscht nach Prag zuriick. Ich lernte in Wien auch andere Baha'is kennen, urn immer aufs neue gute, ja beste Erfalirungen zu machen, frei-lich aber auch mir immer wieder die Erage nach dem Wesen des in all diesen F~i11en 621

  beobacliteten Guten aufzuwerf en: gute Menschen von Haus aus oder durch ihre religidse tiberzeugung verkhrt? 

     Monate vergingen, Miss    

 Martha Root wurde durch ihre Missionsfiitigkeit in be-kanntes  und — noch mehr — in unbekanntes Europa verweht. Ich erfulir von ihr nur vom Hdrensagen, und selbst dies nur ganz nebeihaft und ~iusserst selten. 

 Als nun meine I r~ntr~ume bald zur Wirklichkeit werden soilten (meine Frau und ich waren inzwis —  chen von der Jr6nischen Regierung zu den Ferdausi-Feierlichkeiten eingeladen worden), iiberraschte uns eines Tages die Post mit der Nachricht, dass Miss Martha Root an dem und dern Tage zu der und der Stunde Prag durchreist. 

Mehrere ilirer Prager     

 Freunde fanden wir auf dem Baha'i versammelt. Das Wiedersehen clauerte nur einige wenige Minuten, doch genilgend, urn von der Op-ferwilligkeit, 

Arbeitsfreude, Unerrniidlich-keit 

 und Unverdrossenheit der edlen Mis —  sionirin tief ergriffen zu werden. 

 Jahrein jaliraus in der Frernde pilgernd, sich fur die ihr anvertrauten Aufgaben herurnschlagend, mit allerhand NViderw~irtigkeiten ohne Ran und Ruhe ringend, schaute sic dennoch un-verwiisdich guter Dinge aus. Wir fifisterten uns, dass unmaglich etwas anderes als das tiefernste Bewusstsein einer hohen sittlichen Sendung so vie1 Kraft eineni kdrperlich zarten Wesen verleihen kann. Bk zurn heutigen Tage babe ich nicht gebraucht, diese Erfabrung je Lilge zu straf en. 

 Jetzt passiere ich in meinem Geiste unsere BaM'i-Freunde in fran Revue. Es in gar nicht daran zu denken, sie namendich auf-zuziihlen. 

 Unverrtickbar fest aber findet sich der Gesamteindruck dieser Wahrheits-sucher in meiner Seele herauskristallisiert. Wir kamen durch Mrs. Carpenter bald in Beriihrung mit ihnen. Sie luden uns zurn Gottesdienst, geselligen Unterhaltungen und ernsten 

Auseinandersetzungen      

 em. Alle 14. Tage gab es irgendeine Zusammenkunft —  bald bier, bald dort, bei oder mit Beamten aller m5glichen Ministerien, Amter und Funktionen, bei oder mit Offizieren, Privat-personen,  hoch und niedrig. Unvergesslich ist mit die erste grosse 

Begegnung geblieben. Finer

 der Anwesenden gekirdete sich wie mein Untersuchungsrichter, sodass ich fiber sein Ausfragen beinahe wiltend geworden w~ire. Darf ich verraten, dass er mir zum Schiuss einer der liebsten geworden isO Ich irrsste, Ms ich mich lediglich augefratschelt fiihlte. 

 Nein, man woilte unmittelbar von cinern fernen Pilger etwas i~ber die Ba —  h&'ische in Europa erfahren. Unbcwusst solite er ihnen stillen Trost und unausge —  sprochene Aneiferung zu weiteren Arbeit bringen. Sic wussten, dass wir nicht die ihrigen sind. Sic batten dennoch volles Vertrauen zu uns; zumal wir zwei goldene Schitissel zu ihren Herzen hatten: cm noch nach Prag an mich gerichtetes Schreiben Shoughi-Efendis (in IrAn hatte ich es im iibrigen gar nicht mit!) und unsere Be —  kanntschaft mit Martha Root. Und wohi auch das trug bei, dass meine HochscLit-zung cines religi6sen Gedankens unverkenn-bar  aufrichtig gemeint ist. Ich sagte niclit immer zu allem ccba1e!~~ (tzja). Manclimal gab es auch grosse Gegens~itze in unseren Anschauungen. 

 So besonders, als ich meinen Freunden anriet, die Bedingungen der iran-isehen Regierung zu akzeptieren, urn ihre cigene Schule wieder aufmachen zu diirfen. Meinem Utilitarismus gegentiber beharrten sic (und beharren sicherlich bis heute) auf ciner Miirtyrergeste. 

 Die mit ihnen verbrachten Abende waren (wie alles fUr mich in Pin) ungemein schan. 

 Wir haben dabei viel gelernt, vor allem zur L~uterung unserer cigenen 

Seele.                    
     Die iranische Baha'is     
sind unersc1~ditterlich glaubenfest.

Man wirft ihnen IJnpatriotismus vor.

 So spezifisch persisch wie die Shia kann allerdings der BaM'ismus nie scm. 

 Eben-sowenig  aba wie das Christentum hinclert er die Vaterlandsliebe (oder sind die Eu-rop~ier  nick patriotisch genung?)

          DIE BAHA'IS UND MEINE ERFANRUNGEN

  Die Shia hat im Laufe der Jalirhunderte eine nationale Tradition entwickelt. 

 Mit dieser wird der universalistische Bah&' ismus verge-blich ringen, darnit er weitere 

Wurzeln schiage. Dieser    
Mangel an Extensit~it      
jedoch wird durch die      

Intensitiit und Verinnerlich-ung 

 der iranischen BaM'i-Diasporen reich-lich  kompensiert. 

Die Bah4'i-Gerneinde       

 wird Charakrere ausbilden, die auS der anders-ghubigen, ja feindlich gegenflberstehenden Umwelt durchaus nachahmungswert en-scheinen  dflrften. 

 Die im Abendlande gewonnene Erfahrung wurde mir auch irn persischen Morgenlande vollends bestliigt. Der BahA'isrnus ist un-zweifelhaft  em unschiitzbarer Kulturwert. Oder wiirden auch oline ihn alle jene Men-schen,  deren hohe Sittlichkeit ich bewun-derte  und bewundere, dasselbe Niveau, nur in anderer Form erreicht haben? Oder berulit es nur in der Neuheit der Lehre und in der Frische ihrer ersten und n~ichsten AnlThnger?

IMPRESSIONS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA

 B~ MRS. LouIsI2 R. WAITE 'T0 describe tAbdu'1-Bahi so that the reader may form any mental picture of Him that would in any way do Him justice, is as impossible as to try to paint a sunbeam. The artist may put the ray of yellow light in exactly the right place and with most beautiful effect; but no matter how great his skill, he cannot catch the real essence of the sunbeam — that golden luminosity, which is like an elixir of life, is uncatchable, tin-paintable. 

 So it is with the likeness of tAbdu'I-BaM. His expression is ever changing;  each thought and emotion is mirrored forth and the face becomes so illumined that words are but as the dull, lifeless paint which cannot reproduce the sunbeams — yet, some idea can be gathered from them. 

 When I first saw ~ABDU'L BAHA I was alone and I came face to face with urn all unexpectedly. He stood not even four feet from me. It was in the upper court, with the blue sky overhead and the sunlight shining down brightly upon Him, the hour being but a little after "high noon." I might have thought Him any other member of His family, as His sons-in-law were often passing to and fro, but every atom of my being, my heart and sani cried out, ttThis is He." The face of my dreams of Him stood before me with that same heavenly smile of welcome. The Light of Infinite Love was radiating from His countenance. Majestic, and yet sublimely tender, He was looking right into my eyes. I gave a start as if I had suddenly plunged into an ocean, then stood transfixed. It seemed as if I had come upon Him unawares and saw the C!Glory of the Lord" shining forth around Him; and I know I must have felt as did Mary 

Magdalene when Christ      

 revealed Himself  to her in her vision after the crucifixion (CTh Risen Lord." He motioned me to pass on. I could not. A sense of my great unworthiness made me bow my head — then 625 He passed by me. He was dressed all in white. His bair fell in soft waves about His shoulders and His head was crowned with a white turban bound around with a white cloth. His step was firm and kingly. 

 NVhen lie reached His door He turned and again motioned me to pass on. I came toward Him and when I reached His door I looked up into those marvelous eyes. 

 I knew that every act, every thought of my life was known to Him. Yet, knowing this, I could look fearlessly, unwaveringly at Him, realizing all my sins and weaknesses, yet knowing He understood me as I could never understand myself, and that He was indeed 

"Ifit Love Incarnate."     

 I could not pass until He turned and entered His room; then almost overcome by the vibrations  which thrifled me through and through, I passed on~ Later He came to greet us and I was fully confirmed — this was truly CABDU~LBAHA but a very different  one, I felt, from the one I had first seen. As He firmly grasped my hand with that welcoming pressure that comes deep from the heart, a handshake that warms you through and through, I saw the Divinely human man, the personification of my highest  ideal of an earthly Lather. I never again, while in CAI(ki saw Him as I had in that first meeting. It was then as if I had seen the Reality of His being, with the shades of flesh all raised that the Light of Spirit might stream forth. 

 CABDU~L.BAHA is of medium height, but He holds llimself so superbly, with such commanding dignity, and carries His head so high and with such an air of majesty, that He ever gives the impression of great height. His voice is full and vibrant, each word uttered with marked distinctness and with that tonal quality which leaves a faint echo, as it were, or wave vibrations such as come from a beautifully toned bell. All


<p626>
626             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  through the day it rings out, first in one place, and then in another; for with astonishing rapidity CABDU~L~BAHA seems to be everywhere — now in the garden, now in the room close beside the entrance, now in a guest's room — or you may hear Him calling someone in the ttfamdy section" of the "prison home." 

 Always when I heard His voice, I felt its vibrations most deeply. Like His face, His voice expresses every emotion, from tones that are stern and emphatic to those as tender and loving as the cooing of a dove. 
  His eyes defy description. 

 II only know that to me they seemed gray, with a circle of white around the iris, which at times became luminous. Sometimes in the light, I caught a shade of blue, and again by lamplight they seemed almost brown, — everchanging were they and wonderful. 

 Like His face and His voice, they, too, expressed every emotion felt by Him. 

 I was deeply impressed by His perfect naturalness, His lack of conventionality and set form, and His refreshing simplicity. Divinely simple is He. His hair, which is gray and long, but rather thin, would at one time be flowing softly around His head, and at another it would be tucked up beneath His turban in a careless, comfortable way. All His physical senses seem intensified and when eating anything which Ik particularly likes, He evidences the keenest enjoyment of it.     Likewise, the perfume of a flower will seem to entrance Him. I thought of what one pilgrim at tAkki had said: "When tABDU'L-BAHA inhales the odor of flowers, it is wonderful to see Him. It seems that the perfume of the hyacinth is telling Him something as He buries His face in the flowers. It is like the effort of the ear —  a concentrated attention. 

 How He understands  the mystery of all these things of which we know nothing!" This, indeed, is true. 

 While there was a deep undercurrent of exultancy in CABDU~L~BAHA, yet, during my visit, which was but a few days, to my consciousness there seemed a strain of sorrow and sadness, as if the weight of the world was upon His shoulders. Especially did I realize this upon my first night in 'Akka. 

 I occupied the room next to His. 

 His bed rested against the same wall that mine did and I could hear His slightest move. I could not sleep, and as I lay there wide-awake, I heard Him pacing up and down His room; then He would throw Himself upon His bed; then arise and walk back and forth again. Once, when He threw Himself down upon His bed, He moaned. Oh, that moan! It came from the depths of His soul and it pierced me through the heart. I felt that once again the Christ Spirit was daily, hourly, being crucified by the lack of perfect iove and unity among the believers; that once again It was crying out: 

'~O Jerusalem! Jerusalem!  

 thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee! How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate!" 

 How I longed to go to Him and declare my love and faith in Him! Then I realized that it is not our iove and faith in Him, but our love for one another, that is His crown of glory and the balm for His soul; for He had said to a pilgrim: "If you love one another, it is just the same as if you love Me. The closer you draw to one another, the closer you draw to Me. 

 I will go away from this world, but love always stays. Therefore, you should love one another very much." 

 I felt that every inharmonious thought and action was painfully registered on that great heart; and with this thought came the overwhelming sense of the personal responsibility falling upon each one of us. Having seen and heard ABDU'L-BAHA I realized that He is indeed the Center of the Covenant of God. And with this realization came the deepest joy. No need of arguments and worry over intricate problems of life and death, which have confounded the greatest philosophers; no need to spend the precious time in delving into the unknown and unknowable — He has, or can, explain it all and His explanations are true.

  GLEANINGS from the Writings of Baha'u'llah." ' To the waiting hand a Baha'i gives (Ca Book sent down in truth unto men of insight! 

 It biddeth the people to observe justice  and to work righteousness 2 This Book is of the quintessence of the Holy Books revealed from age to age, and may be weighed by the just Balance that ye possess, the Balance of the testimony of the Prophets and Messengers of God." 

 Although the pages of this Book of Life are charged with the meaning of our mute experience and, hence, can dissipate thy sorrows and dissolve thine anguish," ~ yet these same pages lie open to communicate mysteries oniy to those who can read ccthe testimony of God" with detachment from traditional misconceptions. 

 Some of the Words were gathered by patient labor of the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, and preserved as ~~G1eanings." 

 For the first reapers were the martyrs of Pin, who discovered in the Cause a field of heroism  and yielded up to God a harvest of pun-fled  and consecrated lives.5 

 Let us say that the ccGleanings~~ are the mountain of corn which Brother Giles in homely speech compares to God. 

 A bird may seize one grain from the high peak, and another, then again; and while it may not diminish the magnitude of that storehouse,  still each grain contains all the nutriments  for sustenance. 

 Moreover, each grain is the germ of life itself!

 It is not the romance of words which we praise, nor do we hold a brief for those philosophies which by lure of words have seduced minds from the realities of common sense. 

 We do find it timely to call an inquest  for theologies that have obscured the meaning of words, terms, and figures, and thereby withheld followers from the recognition  of 

God through His Prophets.  

 This is to the end that we may exit above all others the Words of God enunciated by the Prophets, now again sent forth as entities charged with ". such potency as can instill  new life into every human frame Instead of questioning Jesus for the meaning of the prophecies on the Messiah, Israel accepted the priesthood's literal interpreta-don  of the Promise, and was thereby deprived of the regeneration. The Christians, uninstructed by Israel's disinheritance, misinterpreted  the promise of the tcSd Coming,'? and failed to acknowledge the Divine Unity through Mubammad. Thus having deprived itself of insight, Christendom entered the prison of the Dark Ages and closed the door on its own spirit until the waves of IslAm ("The Renaissance") flooded Europe. The Muslims of tr6n stumbled  over the words ~~The Seal of the Prophets"  and put to death the Bib in the year 1850. 

 Today, Jews, Christians, Muslims, besides the other religious communities all of which are expecting a Promised One, cling to the literal interpretation of their prophetic Books and fail to recognize the universal Manifestation of Baha'u'llah.

  less Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future." 

 Is not religion intended for unity? NVhere-fore these separatenesses? 

 In explanation we venture at least two cardinal distinctions between the Words of the Prophets and the words of men: the first, language as human discourse is logical material, and each proposition has one, and oniy one function, so that meaning is not multiple but singleness; whereas, the pronouncements of God are of manifold and inexhaustible meanings.0 

 This circumstance necessitates, on the part of the Revelator Himself, the appointment of an Interpreter (and designated successors)  assured of inspiring and unerring guidance.  To be sure, the Gospels record the appointment of the Apostle Peter to a station  of primacy; and tradition upholds Muhammad's choice of the Irn~m CAli as His successor. Nevertheless, as both of these appointments were unwritten and inconclusive, witnesses agreed upon fact but widely disagreed upon meaning. Rival claimants arose in both of these communities; unanimity on great issues was never perfected  so that time and events confronted a house already divided within itself. Legislation accumulated down the centuries, but it did not have the seal of divine inspiration and wisdom upon it, neither did sacraments and ceremonials take the place of the spirit and intent of the Eounder. Theologies and sects have dismembered Christianity and IslAm and destroyed their unity of faith; but the organic weakness lay in the absence of a divinely-invested Guardian universally recognized by all declared followers of the Prophet. 

 In this Dispensation, theologies and sects are obviated, for Baha'u'llah, in order to bind that Covenant of love and unity which is the essential purpose of religion, wrote His Testament and legislated conclusively, ~~Everything that Abdu'l-Baha says is My meaning." The disaffected resisted this oneness of belief and community, but their agitation proved abortive because the Testament  is an integral part of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah itself. Furthermore, ~Abdu'1 ~Ibid., p. 136. 

 8 Refer to any good Handbook on Logic. 

  " ~G1eanings," p. 175. 

 BatS perpetuated the Law of Succession in His Will and Testament, wherein He establishes  the Guardianship and appoints thereto His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, and his lineal descendants. Inasmuch as all Baha'is turn to the Guardian and accept his interpretation,  no longer can the question of meaning be the centre of obscurantism and the prolific source of divisions. 

 At last, religion becomes the basis of unity. 

 As to the second cardinal distinction: knowledge instructs and cultivates the mind: whereas, the Ccgift of understanding" realized through the Prophet shifts the field of consciousness and is the rebirth of the mind itself. Outside of the Baha'i Writings we do not find elucidation of what happens when the Prophet thunders: ccThus saith the Lord!" 

 The authors of a capital work on the preliminary problems and uses of language assail the early and well-nigh universal belief of the race in a special world of "words of power." 10 They quote from the German scholar preeminent in this field: (cAristotle is dead because he was, more than perhaps any other notable writer in the whole history of philosophy, superstitiously devoted to words For full two thousand  years human thought has lain under the influence of this man's catchwords, an influence which has been wholly pernicious in its results. 

 There is no parallel instance of the enduring potency of a system of words." 

 " Aristotle, the father of the sciences and the backbone of scholasticism, is now charged with getting the universities into a straitjacket, notwithstanding his liberal proposition: "All significant speech is so by convention only" — a convention as vague, or so it seems, as the Social 

Contract which Authority

  ing named after Muhammad, or the nations of Islim that have recited the five daily professions of faith for thirteen hundred years. 

 Surely, no one would wish to undo the civilizing influence of the Law of the Pentateuch  or of the Qur'an except one who had not read history. 

 Although there is nothing liberal in the dicta of Jesus: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God," (CHeaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away," nor anything vague about His Covenant: CCHe that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me,"12 yet we are convinced that nobody would charge the Savior with verbal tyranny except a critic trapped in the appalling confusion between Logos and Exegesis. 

 Baha'u'llah estimates the influence of Jesus upon minds: 'tKnow thou that when the Son of Man yielded up His breath to God, the whole creation wept with a great weeping. 

 By sacrificing Himself, however, a fresh capacity was infused into all created things. Its evidences, as witnessed in all the peoples of the earth, are now manifest before thee. The deepest wisdom which the sages have uttered,  the profoundest learning which any mind bath unfolded, the arts which the ablest hands have produced, the influence exerted by the most potent of rulers, are but manifestations of the quickening power released by His transcendent, His all-perva-sive,  and resplendent Spirit." 

 iS And the modern says? Our fine old Professor held that the skepticism which is the pride of urbanity and enlightenment ought not to lie in the effortless futility that we don't know anything and can't know anything, but, rather in the consent to treat everything as a problem. Then why not turn the mind on the mind itself? Whoever takes the wager will find himself, as Tm-manuel  Kant did, up a blind alley, for there are definite limitations to man's finite mind. The Eighteenth Century couldn't see that and pushed an unreasonable confidence in reason itself, with the result as Amiel sug-12 Matthew iv, 4; xxiv, 35; x, 37. 

  '~ "Gleanings," pp. 856. 

 gests, that its reasoners were able to explain away religion and everything else — but not to create anything. 

 Baha'u'llah points out that as man cannot attain complete knowledge of the reality within himself, even less can he know the Divine Essence. "This confession of helplessness which mature contemplation must eventually impel every mind to make is in itself the acme of human understanding, and marketh the culmination of man's development." 

 14 At this point the 'will to believe is operative, for faith is also a datum of consciousness  struggling to become full-bodied. However, neglected and even stultified by the modern temper, the capacity for faith is coexistent with the capacity for knowi —  edge. 

 Indeed, Reality enters culture through the people of faith: they make up the leaven which animates the realm of being and germinates the arts and manners.'5 In accordance  with this, Baha'u'llah is revealed unto men to lay bare those gems that lie hidden within the mine of their true and inmost selves." 16 Why doesn't a plane tree turn into a camel? Because the a priori form of the thing lies within the thing itself. And the mature form of the mind lies within the sphere of mind itself. The mind is destined to both education and conversion but not to Theophany. Consequently, man is compared  to a mine which is worked for its gems; to a sheep that gets lost without the Shepherd; to a lamp supplied with both oil and wick but incapable of self-ignition. Man, "the supreme Talisman," is a sign of God and the apogee of His creation, stands in absolute need of the Prophet.

IN PRAISE OF WORDS                635

     The Words of Baha'u'llah    

 are Logos and constitute a collective force of the first order, which, by power of Spirit consciously and unconsciously subdues the minds, informs  and recreates them in Truth. 

 This world is the descent into existence; the Manifestation offers the ascent into being: here we are born into time; the Manifestation gives the rebirth into eternity. The Words of God draw the souis of men to life eternal: men, seeking a foretaste of that immortality, strive to perpetuate themselves on earth as well by carving their names into history. 

 From Baha'u'llah we learn that man's estate is twofold: its subjective reality is consciousness; its objective reality is civilization.  Culture or the totality of arts, sciences, laws, manners and institutions, is the visible embodiment or concrete form of consciousness itself. 

 Before the New Cycle, consciousness in the 'Vest had not gone beyond Naturalism and automatic necessity. 

 Men had forgotten God and turned to nature as teacher and goal quite unaware of man's dominion on earth.'8 Voices were raised in protest, and a lonely poet cried out: ccAh Lady, we receive but what we give, And in our            life alone does nature live;" (Samuel 

Taylor Coleridge)          

  but these were words among many. 

 In the East — the Light, all light comes out of the East — the B&b (the "Gate") appeared in 1844. 

 His divine Manifestation gave consciousness a new orientation based upon the relativity and evolution of religion. The primary aspect of Truth is changeless and absolute, the same throughout the time cycles; but that secondary aspect of religion which concerns social laws and institutions, is valid oniy for the cycle assigned to the given Revelation. 

 Therefore, the divine Message for the Day in which we live is the soic basis of culture and the energy behind creative evolution and achievement. 
                           
   18 In 1843 Thomas Carlyle  

 wrote: "To speak in the ancient dialect we ¶ave forgotten God'; in the most modern dialect and very truth of the matter, we have taken up the Fact of this universe as it is not." "Past and Present," 

Essay on Phenomena, Oxford 
University Press, London.  

 The Manifestation of the BTh precipitated an epoch of unprecedented mental exploration  in which the concept of evolution was taken into thought and verified by the emergence of new schools of knowledge or sciences. Psychology came out of philosophy as a new organism, accompanied by pedagogy  or education; politics went ahead; economics and anthropology were born. Contemporaneously, the concept of evolution was related to the earth, which records the proofs of its cycles in the geological strata; the evolution of the human race became the theme of biology; the evolution of classes dominated the trend of economics; while the evolution of the forms and organization of society was contributed by ccthe science of man" himself. 

 This new mental fecundity due to the BTh's outpouring of Spirit brought forth technics and inventions as well: time is defied and space conquered. Physics justified its birth by discovering the relativity of time and space, but its proofs for the uninitiated lie in changes that we now accept  as commonplace. 

 Man lives in a three-dimension world: he possesses the earth, crosses the oceans, moves through the air. Man subdues Nature and wrests from it the materials for his civilization. 
Behold that material civilization!

 Is there to be no spiritual counterpart? 

 Baha'u'llah the ~cG1ory of God" was manifested in 1863. us Revelation sets forth the principles, laws, and institutions of World Order. Exiled from IrAn, confined by the prison walls of tAkki, and subjected for forty years to the Sulv6nate and the Caliphate, Baha'u'llah withheld not the outpouring of Spirit. By means of Letters He issued commands for the establishment of the "Most Great Peace" to kings and rulers. To all men He unveiled the pattern of consciousness based upon the oneness of mankind:  this is detachment from all prejudices and acceptance of that one life and spirit which is the reality of man. 

 This new understanding is consummated in ~Abdu'1 Bali: His unique station combines the perfection  of humanity with the Mystery of Divinity, and He is the Exemplar to the nations. 

 This hour is the challenge and test.

                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  When we undertook the new material civilization and began to live in space, we left behind the flat surface dimension of the earth; so does the universal consciousness leave behind the flat surface dimension of the mind with its expansive forms of self-love,  which become destructive as religious sectarianism, exploitation of classes, racial superiorities, militant nationalism. 

 Baha'u'llah leads us into a Commonwealth of Nations, which is more than expansion and association, for the Divine Polity takes the nations into another dimension which searches the base and reaches the heights of unity. 

 We are called to be citizens of Heaven and of "Thy Kingdom come on earth": world government lies within the power of the creative Word.

THE CONTINUITY OF RELIGION
                  B~ STANWOOD COBB

  RELIGIOUS bigotry and prejudice are chiefly due to religions being viewed as historical rather than as functional events. The followers of every great world religion tend to look upon their own revelation and the institutions built around it as unique in the history of the planet and consequently to deny the authenticity of other world religions. Hence a bitter rivalry has arisen between religions making such monopolistic claims. 

 'XJhen, however, we take a scientific view of a religion as functional in the development  of humanity we are able to look not oniy with tolerance but with sympathy at other religions than our own. 

 Wherever a sincere spiritual force is effective in the lives of a people, there we see a religion which we may respect. When, ho*ever, religious expression degenerates into institutionalism either at home or abroad, we may know that religion is no longer performing its normal function. 

 The function of religion is: — first, to make humanity God-conscious; second, to make humanity obedient to the Divine Will (this implies today the unifying of humanity);  and third, to bring to each human being the understanding of how to make use of prayer and guidance and thus take advantage of the inestimable privileges offered man by the Divine Power in the way of communion and help. 

  Religions do not come into being by accident.  No great historic epoch and no section  of the world has been deprived by Destiny of the opportunity to acquire the priceless treasures of true religion. The spiritual evolution of the human race is as much a part of the majestic plan of the 638 Creator as is the evolution of solar systems. "Were it not for the instructive, stimulative and inspirational power of religion upon the heart and conscience of humanity, men would remain morally on a level with animals.  In other words they would be unmoral, without the refined conscience which spiritual man possesses. 

 They would be creatures of impulse and of instinct, following  the law of the herd but recognizing that as the oniy law outside themselves to be obeyed. 

 Religion brings to man a new conscience, instructing him in the higher laws of living which make for harmony, happiness and prosperity both in an individual and a cot-lective  sense. 

 Through religion man is enabled to transcend himself to become nobler than his biologically inherent animal qualities would permit. Through religion he is trained to sublimate all of these animal qualities — qualities perfectly legitimate in their own field but obstructive to the development  of a catholic and harmonious human society. 

 Through religion man is made aware of his spiritual potentiality. He learns that his soul can aspire in the realm of spirit and need not be dragged and weighted down by all the heavy burdens of carnality. 

 Like a young child learning to walk, he begins to realize powers which he can put into practice. In the use of faith, prayer and spiritual guidance he becomes more and more proficient, growing daily nearer to the full stature of spiritual manhood for which he is destined. 

 Can any one deny that these are the purposes  and these the effects of religion? 

 Any unbiased scientific study of the history of religion as a moral, social and spiritual force in the life of humanity will substantiate the foregoing statements.


<p639>
THE CONTINUITY OF RELIGION                                 639

  But whence does religion spring? Flere we come to a much mooted question. 

 We are told by the Founders of the world's great religions that the truth which they teach is revealed to them from the Divine Source itself; that they are but channels for the Divine instruction and power to flow through; and that their word is, indeed, the Word of God. 

 Such is the claim of all the great Revelators. 

 But the attitude of science during the last century has been to disparage such superhuman claims. 

 From the scientific point of view there seems little chance of objectively proving the claims of revelation. The scientific mind can investigate everything  in the phenomenal universe, but it cannot investigate the Mind and 'Ways of God. Here is a field distinctly barred to the scientific approach. There is only one standpoint from which the claims of revelation might be investigated, appraised and corroborated. 

 This standpoint is the field of actual religious achievement. 

 Mien we study the force which inheres in every great world religion — a force definite  and unique, a force which, while its sources may be beyond our investigation, as regards its workings and effects lies clearly within the field of scientific investigation —  what do we see? History shows that every great religion in the days of its purity — before institutionalism and human dogma begin their taints — exerts a terrific force upon human conduct and human character, a force unparalleled in the history of human morals as regards its contagiousness, its miraculous power to change character, and its quality of sustained application to the art of living on the part of the individual adherent. 

 This force of religion is indeed mysterious — as mysterious as is the force of electricity. 

 Can we reasonably conceive that such a force can emanate from 'a source no higher than human mentality? 

 Are these Founders of religion simply spiritual geniuses who are but a few degrees loftier in moral and spiritual  insight than their fellows? If so, how could they produce these magical effects upon human nature, both individually and collectively? Effects which last not for a day, but for milleniums. Effects which no founders of schools of philosophies, not even the greatest, have ever been able even in the slightest degree to approximate. 

 Secondly, we should have to assume that in their claims of revelation the Founders of the great world religions were either using deliberate falsehood or suffering under hallucinations. 

 Both of these points of view have been taken. 

 Previous to the religious tolerance of the twentieth century it had been the custom for earnest adherents of Christianity to accuse the founders of other world religions as being hypocrites, falsifiers or emissaries of evil. The theological doctrine  of the uniqueness of Christianity induced this attitude. But as scientific liberalism made inroads into Christian theology  and the history of religion came to be studied without prejudice of sectarianism, it became apparent to scientific historical observation that such characters as Confucius,  Buddha, Zoroaster and Muhammad were not tittering deliberate falsehoods when they claimed to be channels of Divine communication  to humanity. 

 They were at least sincere, there could be no question about that. Ergo — assuming the impossi —  bility of substantiating this claim of divine revelation — certain materialistically inclined scholars of comparative religion, abnormal psychologists, and other secularists were led to the conclusion that these claimants to divine revelation were suffering from hallucinations. 

 Has not science, in its materialistic scepticism, brought itself here into a ridiculous dilemma? 

 Those beings so pure and sinless in character, so noble in their self-sacrificing lives that no other humans can even be put in the same category; those beings who have expressed lofty truths which humanity has intuitively accepted as a perfect pattern for human behavior; those beings the power of whose exemplary lives and exalted teachings has influenced humanity more than any other force, — can it be that these great souis were merely insane? That their conception of the nature of their mission and the source of their wisdom was not only fallacious but the expression of psychologically diseased natures?

  faith and living against opinions of modernistic secularists, I cannot see how the verdict of thoughtful people can be cast in favor of the materialistic psychologist. 

  Is the idea of revelation, then, so impossible  from the scientific point of view? The painter, the poet, the composer feel that their inspirations come from some source greater than themselves. Plato, the greatest creative thinker and literary artist the world has ever produced, had a definite theory as to where his inspirations came from. 

 The artist, he states, is but a channel for images and truths which come to him from the World of the Ideal. The soui of the great artist is able to contact this higher archetypal  world where perfection already exists, and thus bring to earth artistic revelations, creative ideas, and discoveries in the realm of truth. 

 Since Plato was himself such a colossally creative thinker, we must acknowledge at least some importance to this theory of his regarding the nature of in —  spiration and creation. 

 Many a great artist, thinker, and inventor since the day of Plato has felt this same way about the nature of inspiration. 

 Their greatest works have seemed to them not so much the manufacture of their own limited mentality as a projection, through the sensitivity of their being, of truth or beauty from some world outside themselves. 

 In fact, so disparate from their creator are the greatest achievements of the creative soul that he must look with a feeling of awe upon these creations emanating through him and enjoy them in a purely impersonal relation, receiving from them an inspiration as from a force totally and miraculously outside of his own personality. 

 Now if it is a possibility for any creative person to receive an inspiration from some mysterious source outside himself, it is certainly  possible for the prophetic soul of a great world Saviour to become a channel for those Divine Forces which seek to guiSe and stimulate this planet into higher spiritual evolution. 

 Not oniy do these Teachers of religion proclaim a truth greater than they themselves  could originate, but they are born into the world already destined for such a mission. 

 Their station is above that of ordinary mortals, as the station of the ambassador  of a great emperor is peerless in whatever country he may officially abide. "They are the Treasuries of divine knowledge, and the Repositories of celestial wisdom. 

 Through them is transmitted a grace that can never fade." 1 These great messengers of God are an essential part of the Divine plan for the evolution of humanity. 

 Biological evolu-don  has gone as far as it is able to go when it has produced "homo sapiens" — man with the power of thought. 

 The further evolution of man in the way of development of his creative intelligence and his spiritual progress depend upon forces from a higher plane. 

 Religion is this force absolutely essential to man's spiritual evolution, to the awakening and training of potential qualities which elsewise would never come into active expression. 

 Evolution now ceases to be a something which operates on man apart from his own conscious effort. 

 Progress beyond primitive man he can make only by voluntary conscious  effort. It is to awaken and aid this effort toward higher spiritual self-develop-ment of humanity that these great Teachers come to earth. Without the inspiration of their teachings and the dynamic stimulus to spiritual progress which they give to man by means of a tremendous outpouring of that cosmic, spiritual, creative force which has been called the Holy Spirit, man would remain on the moral and mental level of the animal. 

 ccEurther evolution, if it takes place," says P. D. Ouspensky in his "Tertium Organum," rccannot be an elemental and unconscious affair, but will result solely from conscious efforts toward growth. Man, not striving toward evolution, not conscious of its possibility, not helping it, will not evolve. And the individual who is not evolving does not remain in a static condition, but goes down, degenerates. This is the general law."

  An important point to consider here is that the revelations of religion do not come by chance. 

 They are part of a continuous plan for the spiritual evolution of humanity. They are a special communication and dispensation  of that great creative and guiding Force of the universe which we call God, and they are revealed through spiritualized beings who are special channels for the flow of this creative force. 

 Humanity, like a battery which has to be recharged, is under the necessity of fresh spiritual impulse at stated intervals. 

 Fortunately  for the spiritual evolution of humanity, at every epoch when one religion has been outgrown a new religion has magically arisen — a religion full of vital hope and promise and charged with the power to retnold and to remake the Lives of its communicants. 

 "In their essence all these religions are one. 

 Spiritual Truth cannot, indeed, be different and conflicting. The aims of all the great prophets were one: to bring human beings into the Divine Consciousness, to advance their spiritual development, and to effect better conditions of organized living. 

 t~Nor can the great Founders of religions be supposed to exist in any sort of rivalry one to the other. Their purpose is one. Their devotion to Divinity is one. Their devotion to humanity is one. There can be no possibility of rivalry between these great Souls whose first requisite is abnegation of self, whose words and deeds are guided by divine inspiration, and whose lives serve no other purpose than to mirror Divinity to man.~~ ~ From this point of view it will be seen that no religion is final. As humanity develops,  it acquires capacity for new and higher revelations. 

 At the same time that its capacity to comprehend is constantly increased, its ability to lead a spiritual life periodically diminishes (as has already been shown), thus necessitating a regular and definite reoccurrence of spiritual revelation. 

 Each Founder of a great religion gives warning of this to His followers. 

He

World," by Stanwood Cobb.  

 speaks of a Return, and warns them to be open and receptive to Truth when it returns again, as return it must when the gradual crystallization and degeneration of established religion takes place through institu —  tionalism and the natural carnal proclivities of man.

 Today it is apparent that all over the world religion is in great need of renewaL The spiritual consciousness of humanity is suffering eclipse. This is true not only of Christianity but also of every other great world religion — Confucianism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Muhammadan-mm. 

 With the normal restraints of religion removed, with man's spiritual conscience obscured as his scientific intelligence is accentuated,  we see taking place a rapidly growing chaos and a threatened disintegration  of world civilization. 

 Clearly the time is ripe for a renewal of man s spiritual consciousness, and that renewal  is already offered the world in the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. 

 Here we find not only a renewal of all the spiritual beauty and dynamic force of previous revelations, but also pronouncements especially adapted to the advanced needs of this day. We have not oniy general moral laws, but their definite  application to individual and collective living. 

 We have a comprehensive set of principles upon which the establishment of a great world order is predicated, and a great world civilization of a perfection such as the past has hardly ventured to dream of. 

  Of all the teachings of Baha'u'llah, perhaps none is so needed as the clear enunciation  which He gives regarding the continuity of religion. As we have pointed out at the beginning of this article, the lack of such realization has been the cause of the crystallization of religious thought and expression and its disintegration into religious  rivalries and hostilities never intended by the Divine Power from whose great Purpose for humanity all religions emanate. 

 Baha'u'llah makes clear not only that His Revelation is a renewal of spiritual truth and potency necessitated by the decline of


<p643>

  spiritual consciousness throughout the world; but also that, just as other religions have faded and declined, so the religious expression built around His message is also destined to decadence, in the course of time. Thus He definitely prepares His followers and safeguards them against the dangers of bigotry, of religious smugness, and of blindness to the just and verifiable claims of a new Revelator when His day arrives. 

 How refreshing is this view of religion, which is now seen as a part of the normal functioning of our planetary life, as necessarily  recurrent as are the seasons. Indeed each religion passes through its phases of growth comparable to the seasons — its springtime of blossoming and rejuva-nescence, its summer of growth, its autumn of rich fruitage, and its winter of crystal —  lization and decline. 

 And now again a spiritual springtime has appeared, and the Holy Spirit is pouring down Its rays upon this planet with a potency that is stirring everything to rapid motion and renewed growth. And as in the springtime old forms of vegetation, which in their sear and withered stiffness have un — gered through the winter, become broken up by the actinic force of the sun and give way to marvelous new growths whose nourishment they help to furnish by their own decay, so today ancient institutions are falling and every old form is yielding ground to a marvelous newness, which, however  disconcerting it may be to unprepared minds, is the breath of life and hope to those who can see beyond the present moment. 

   CtWhen the Holy Manifestation

 of God, who is the sun of the world of His creation, shines upon the worlds of spirits, of thoughts and of hearts, then the spiritual spring and new life appear, the power of the wonderful springtime becomes visible, and marvelous benefits are apparent. 

 And now, in this divine new age, see what development has been attained in the world of minds and thoughts, and it is now oniy the beginning of its dawn. 

 Before long you will see that new bounties and divine teachings will illuminate  this dark world, and will transform these sad regions into the paradise of Eden."

            A NEW PHASE OF HUMAN THOUGHT

  AR is the most preventable accident!"  said cAbdu~1~Bahi, the exemplar of the Baha'i Faith. His words, which even twenty years ago seemed quite improbable, carry to modern ears an inescapable and terrible conviction. 

 We recognize in them no less than a profound indictment of the nations of the world. 

 The history of these last years has been dominated by two tendencies intimately affecting the future of war. First, there has come such an expansion in the possibilities of human intercourse, such intesifi-cation  of economic dependence, together with a wider sympathy for the habits and ideals of alien groups, that for the first time the sons of earth are drawn ciose enough to conceive and aspire after forms of relationship  other than violence. To this new-felt  need — actually an opportunity to substitute for the cruel and gross processes of war a more civilized interaction — has been added, secondly, a fatal necessity in the guise of an armament revolution." Until the end of the 19th century the methods of war had "remained stagnant and unprogressive for hundreds of years." 1 But the conflict of 1914 brought to perfection new devices  for mass murder — poison gas, air raids, tanks, heavy artillery — techniques so efficient that in four years' time, more than twice as many men were killed as in 123 years of warfare preceding 1914. The costs of war are now so staggering that statesmen  like Mr. Baldwin are impelled to ask: "Who in Europe does not know that one more war in the 'West and the civilization of the ages will fall with as great a shock as that of Rome?" 

 2 Modern war is not oniy a preventable accident; it is a dreadful 1 Dalton, Hugh, "Toward the Peace of Nations," p.  2. 

 2 Quoted by Dalton, p. 1. 

 scourge, more to be feared than the Black Death. 

 This has not been true in every time. The benefits of war have often cancelled out its evils, have actually advanced the course of human evolution. For example, otherwise  isolated groups used to meet upon the battlefield; and long after physical combat had ceased, the cultural ferment induced by such contact altered and enriched the customs  of the hostile peoples. With the impact of Islim upon Europe during the Crusades, the structure of the Dark Ages was shattered and the western world entered a new phase. By revealing unsuspected horizons, war has undoubtedly speeded the progress of civilization. 

 Moreover, it has served to breed hardy and vigorous men, inspiring in them the will to enterprise and action. Discipline, cooperation,  inventiveness — these, as well as death, sorrow, waste, have been byproducts of an activity which the modern world must now condemn. For the costs have finally overtaken the profits. Today, ~ see war no longer as a tragic necessity in human life, but as a horrible arrest in development."  8 The figures of losses sustained by the fighting nations in the Great 'War, appalling as they are — ten million wounded, a total money cost of $337,846,000,000 — actually indicate but a sitall portion of the destruction.  The costs of war, indeed, cannot be estimated, but their significance may be glimpsed when it is remembered that, as a biologist has written, "The war question is essentially a problem in human ecology. Just as the plants and animals in an aquarium, pond, or forest constitute a delicately  balanced complex, so human society

  is a complicated organism. 

 War, therefore, does not affect merely the armies engaged, but the civil populations as well, not oniy of the belligerent nations but also of remote neutrals." 

 ~ Thus the Great War distorted every phase of modern life. Six million people were wiped out by Spanish influenza. ccNrl all Polish children under six are said to have died from starvation." 

 The fatalities among Armenians, Syrians, Jews, Greeks, Rumanians, Austrians, Serbians, Russians, Belgians, due to starvation and disease,  were enormous. 

 Nations jeopardized even their future health to feed this terror which coveted oniy the fittest human specimens.  In the United States, "about 83 per cent of the drafted men who possessed defects of a probably more or less hereditary chAracter were rejected," to return to their homes and father a generation.6 

  At the same time, the economic equilibrium of the world collapsed. 

 Factories and industries, growing up to fulfill war needs, caused dislocation and overproduction after the war. Political instability interfered  with trade. 

 High and oppressive taxation cut down the purchasing power of the public and lowered the standard of living by ten per cent. 

 In the light of subsequent developments, it is interesting to read a postwar prophecy that "the very breakdown of modern economic society might be the price exacted." 

 Yet the physical consequences — biologic and economic, together with the political disturbances created by the Versailles 

Treaty                     

 — were overshadowed, if possible, by the havoc worked upon the character of public ethics and private morals. No appraisal could exaggerate these factors, which in their totality form the damning evidence of C~man~s inhumanity to man,'' and predict in grim accents the terms upon which another war shall be fought. One of the strangest attitudes of our day is the nonchalance with which the common man watches his government prepare for suicidal conflict. Like

 blithe children the nations of the world seek arms for a tourney with Death, apparently unconscious of the merciless intent of their opponent. 

 There are, to be sure, thousands of persons who, through the bitter years of the Great V//ar, acquired an aching thirst for peace, and many of these have since devoted their lives to this ideal. 

 Moreover, it is now the opinion of an imposing number of statesmen and leaders that war and human society have come to the parting of the ways. 

 Diverse projects exist for the consummation of this process, sustained by as many explanations of the causes and cures of war as there are fields of human activity. After fifteen years of faithful application,  however, some people are questioning whether success does not wait upon the coordination of these separate enterprises. 

  Now no plan, it is safe to say, so unites every contributory movement, so richly harmonizes the impulses and efforts of men towards the superb goal — world peace — as does the Baha'i Faith. tAbdu'1-Bahi wrote, '~The scope of Universal Peace must be such that all the communities and religions may find their highest wish realized in it." ~ Comprehensive in analysis, all-embracing in scope, inviting the cooperation of every forward-looking individual and group, the Baha'i Faith not only conforms with fact, but is enabled to enlist and conserve every authentic interest in the quest for that ttdurable peace" which, as President Roose —  velt has said, "is the oniy goal worthy of our best efforts." 

 Perhaps the primary and most stimulating contribution of Baha'u'llah (Father of tAbdu'1-BaM and Founder of this Cause) was an affirmation in unequivocal terms that the case for peace would prosper. 

 ctYet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the cMost Great Peace' shall come." His words challenge  at the outset the threadbare theory that war is inevitable because human nature does not change, a brand of illogic which "Baha'i Peace Program," p. 19.

  is both untenable and futile. Failing as it does to distinguish between the instincts of individuals and social institutions, it is unable to recognize that whereas human impulses may not change, their expression-forms  can certainly be shaped and guided. Happily, the opinion of an eminent body of psychologists has been recorded: cclWar is not instinctive and ineradicable. 

 By a vote of 346 to 10 the members of the American 

Psychological Association 

 have registered their opposition to the doctrine that war is a part of human nature and cannot be stopped." 

 ~ 'War, actually more akin to politics than to biology, might be defined as "a contest by force between political groups." '~ Arising from the struggle for existence, it is not therefore a necessary conclusion, but rather the most obvious and brute-like soiu-tion of this competition for life. Men —  who are endowed with intellect — have often replaced natural processes with reasoned ones, especially when their very existence has been found to depend upon the latter. As one Baha'i writer says, ccDisillusion would only be justified if human society could be successfully established on the war principle." 

 12 Those who are alert to historic  necessities know that war is doomed; at the same time they are prepared for a sharp and long-drawn struggle to eradicate the principle which so intimately penetrates the fabric of modern life. 

  tAbd'lBh' has said:     ctNQr is not limited to one cause. There are many kinds of war and conflict going on: political war, commercial war, patriotic war and racial war. This is the very civilization of war." 

 '~ Today economic causes seem the most significant, with our world a seething mass of economic stresses and strains. Unemployment, "the cancer of the body economic," was estimated in 1932 as affecting  some fifty millions of the world's population, unquestionably a conservative figure. 

 Another critical question is that of 10 Science News Letter, August 6, 1932.

 population pressure and it is said that whereas "in 1800 there were probably 600,000,000 or 700,000,000 people in the world, today the number is perhaps 1,800,000,000." 

 14 Increasing complexity of economic life together with a breakdown of the system of production and distribution,  (both of them problems grossly complicated by the Great War), these are the factors leading to friction and rivalries. 

 But — and it is a consideration fraught with importance and hope — economic causes in thernselyes do not result in war. Conflict springs up only when political groups, in an effort "to support the economic interests of their citizens," 15 clash and resort to violence. 

 With immigration laws, tariffs, harsh trade policies, raw material monopolies, and protection of foreign investments, governments attempt to underwrite prosperity,  ever guided by the unhappy notion that one nation can prosper independently of other nations, even at their expense. As a matter of fact, the World Economic Conference of 1927 disposed of this creed: CCAnY strictly nationalistic policy is harmful not only to the nation which practices it, but also to the others and therefore defeats its own ends." 

 16 This twentieth-century truth, still not universally known, stands as one of the basic premises of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 Economic irritants are not, however, the soic instigators of a war spirit, and seldom if ever are they formally acknowledged. It is far easier to address popular fury in terms of its emotional antipathies. In other words, human prejudices form the most fertile ground for the seeds of war — prejudices national, racial, religious, class and cultural. How carefully through the ages these provincialisms have been fostered, despite the fact that "the most important step from savagery to culture is the emancipation of the individual man from complete or temporary segregation or isolation."

  transferred from the first primitive tribal unit, exalting itself with the name "Men" as if other tribes were not men, to the succeeding  feudal, state and national organizations. 

 Ethnocentrism, that loyalty which does good service in stabilizing each newly-created society, always in the end projects the social body into armed conflict. 

 Today, disguised as nationalism, it is arousing passions which inevitably must hurtle us into another desperate struggle. Perhaps in no other school will men finally learn that: CCA1L prejudices whether of religion, race, politics or nation, must be renounced, for these prejudices have caused the world's sickness. 

 It is a grave malady which, unless  arrested, is capable of causing the destruction  of the whole human race. Every ruinous war with its terrible bloodshed and misery has been caused by one or another of these prejudices." 

 18 These and many others are £he true causes of wars. But we must distinguish between causes and that basic condition of world society which makes war actually possible. For war is itself nothing but one method for settling disputes. It has already been dispensed with in the relations of individuals,  families, states; oniy between nations does it remain the honored arbiter. Only between nations are there no effective definitions of law and government, no restraints  to violence, no alternative courts of bst appeal. 

  International relations, up to the Great War, were in a state of complete anarchy. Even today, after the efforts of the Versailles Treaty to establish a League of Nations, and in spite of subsequent pacts and agreements and the organized work of millions of interested people, international relations are still too chaotic to prevent the catastrophe which tempts us like a lurid shadow. Definitely, at least five institutions and processes for the prevention of war have been established: the League of Nations, the International Labor 

Office, the Permanent      
Court of International     

 Justice at The Hague, the Locarno treaties and

 Magazine, February, 1934. 

 similar insurance treaties, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Actually, "every nation in the world has become signatory to some kind of a solemn pledge that it will settle its future difficulties by pacific means." 19 Yet in 1935 we stand in more danger of war than at any time since 1914. 

 The League of Nations, once seen as the hope of the world, has in the last year proved itself ineffectual. Indeed, it is in no true sense a League of Nations, since the United States, Germany and Japan — to name the most important — do not belong. And the League is powerless to stop them, it is powerless to interfere if Japan wishes to quarrel with China, it is wholly inadequate to prevent the next great conflict for which all countries are preparing with ill-disguised haste. 

 The armaments race has at last been entered upon frankly although six years ago war was renounced "as an instrument of national policy." 20 It is a fact that the world spends enough on armaments in one year to support the total cost of the League for more than six centuries! 

 In a world so enslaved by selfishness, so bestial in many of its impulses, so intent upon destroying the few world institutions which have been laboriously erected, what remains to a lover of peace? 

 In what consolation  may his soul find patience and what assurance will sustain him through the coming  darkness? There is only one answer. Those who cling to the bright vision of a New World Order, whose thoughts continuously encircle it and whose actions faithfully contribute to its consummation — they shall wrest sanity from the world's insanity and peace from its bloodthirstiness. 

 Shoghi Effendi, Guardian   

 of the Baha'i Faith, has written: ttTlnat the forces of a world catastrophe can alone precipitate such a new phase of human thought is, alas, becoming increasingly apparent.

KING HAAKON OF NORWAY
                     AN AUDIENCE
                  B~ MARTHA L. ROOT

MEET His Majesty King      

 Haakon of Norway, 0 reader, and you will be as charmed as was the writer of this article. Here is a King with a most delightful manner. 

 Why, he can laugh at himself and with everybody else! He speaks his thoughts so frankly, so sincerely, his sense of humor is so sparkling, his sense of proportion  so balanced, he is an artist in knowing how to live. Is he spiritual? 

 Yes, very! The fire of his predecessor on the throne, King Haakon the Good of Norway (who in 965 A.D. first brought Christianity to the attention of this great land of the North) burns in his deep, dark eyes, but he is one of the smiling kings who give to humanity religion full of joy. It was a merry audience full of fun and wisdom, but the man who can command this radiant, vital spirituality is a King of courage and evolved personality. 

 What impressed me most in this ever memorable conversation in the Royal Palace in Oslo, May 9, 1935, was His Majesty's profound belief that the security of the world and universal peace depend upon religion. 

 If we had one religion that peoples could agree upon and live, it would bring the tranquillity of the nations. Every point touched upon came back to this one solution, the spiritual foundation for enduring peace. His most passionate desire is for world peace. Even as one from America wrote recently, "It is our conviction that it is these nations of Northern Europe which may be expected to take a leading part in all plans intended to make peace and bring about an amelioration of the present very troubled and uncertain international condition."  Mr. Frank Bucliman — inaugurator of the fine Oxford Group Movement — had the divine guidance to come to Norway this same year with a team of one hundred spiritual helpers; he too, thinks it may be these Northern countries that will save the world. These strong, Norwegian people, neutral, whose eyes are lifted tip to high mountains and who look down into deep valleys, are serious thinkers, and what they believe, they live, they promote. 

 His Majesty King Haakon, I observed, knows very well the religious movements of the twentieth century and spoke of some of them with fine appreciation. 

 He mentioned  one which he says does much good and it does not ask to what church one belongs; some of His Majesty's bishops favor it we know, but as Norway has a state religion, Lutheranism — and also as His Majesty's government is composed of many parties, this wise King did not permit the audience to become an interview. 

 If one could write what he says about religion, about the economic solution, if one could give his scintillating psychological comments on the universal principles needed to make a better world, it would be eagerly read. 

 He told me it would never do, for if one quotes a King, something he may say with a smile, when one reads it without the smile and doesn't hear the nuance, the world, the political parti~s, the church may take issue! 

 LIe laughingly said it is hard to be a King; it is hard enough to be a President, but that is only for a term of years, it is more difficult to be a King because he is chosen for life! 

 However, there is another way of knowing  this great King and that is through his life. What one could never learn from an interview with him, I relate to you as coming  direct from the hearts of the Norwegian people and from me. I was ill in Norway immediately upon arrival, and after many weeks when convalescing, I walked daily in 651

  a beautiful park of silver birches where many Norwegians came and went enjoying its loveliness. The first day I asked my nurse: "What is that great splendid building on the summit of this people's park?" 

 She replied in astonishment, ~Do you not know that is the Royal Palace and this is the King's Park?" I saw the standard waving from the flagstaff and my inner eye saw his warmly-human heart that he shares so generously. 

 The Norwegian people said to me: "We love our King; he makes us feel he is one of us even though he lives in the great palace and we in our houses. 

 He is so wise, so honest, so energetic. We call him our tKing Haakon the Good.' Every Sunday he goes to the Palace Chapel or to one of the regular church services. The Palace Chapel is a place where every one may come. 

 This tall, slender, handsome King moves among his people; he may be seen walking in the streets of Oslo, he is often at the opera and very frequently at the social functions arranged to help the needy. One could hardly think of him — yet —  — as the father of his country. 

 He seems more the brother who understands, sympathizes; he is gentle, careful and has all the human perfections in activity. 

 An audience with His Majesty King Haakon may be more illuminating and forgerable than an interview. 

 This spiritually  lovable King of Norway who will never talk about himself, who in the whole conversation did not use the words ccme I, my or mine," made me happy. It was so good to laugh, so Gibraltar-reassuring to find His Majesty standing firm for religion — liberal, vitalizing religion to change hearts and bring the enduring peace. 

 Gloriously the sun streamed through the palace windows of his room and fell full upon his pleasing, thoughtful countenance as he said goodbye. The sun did not need to say that morning, "I am shining," and the King did not need to give any interview, for his life spoke it! 

     Long may His Majesty King  
Haakon of Norway live!     

 And through his way of c!living the life" teach all the world and begin with us, the joyous adventure of following  God's Will, the fun of fellowship and sharing and the enchantment of being charming and spiritually ideal even to the humblest!

SOME MEMORIES OF THE
             SOJOURN OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA IN
            PARIS, OCTOBER-DECEMBER, 1911

          B~ SITARIH KHANUM, LADY BLOMFIELD

  (NOTE: In Vol IV of the Baha'i W/orld, 193 01932, appeared "Some Memories of Abdu'l-Baha's stay in London in 1911." Recently some of the Baha'i friends have desired to have some further Memories, those of the sojourn in Paris, October-December, 1911. The author.) 

  MUCH has been written of the journeys of Abdu'l-Baha, Abbas IThifendi. Having been released from the prison fortress of Akka, after forty years of captivity, he set himself to obey the sacred charge laid upon him by his Father, Baha'u'llah. 

 Accordingly  he undertook a three years' mission into the Western World. 

 He left the Holy Land and came to Europe in 1911. During that and the two following years, he visited Switzerland, England, Scotland, France, America, Germany and 

Hungary.                   

 When the days of Abdu'l-Baha's first visit to London (in the autumn of 1911) were drawing to a close, his friends, Monsieur  and Madame Dreyfus-Barney, prepared an apartment for his residence whilst in the French capital. 

 It was charmingly furnished, sunny, spacious, situated in the Avenue de Cam6ens (No. 4) whence a flight of steps led into the 

Trocadero Gardens.  Here  

 the Master often took solitary, restful walks. 

 Sheltered in this modern, comfortable Paris flat, he whom we revered, with secretary servitors and a few close friends, sojourned for an unforgettable nine weeks. 

 I shall try to describe some of the events which took place, but these events owe their significance to the atmosphere of otherworldliness  which encompassed the Master and his friends. 

 We, at least some of us, had the impression  that these happenings became, as it were, symbols of 

Sacred Truths.             

 Who is this, with branch of roses in his hand, coming down the steps? 

 A pictur-. esque group of friends (some fr6nians wearing the kola, and a few Europeans following him, little children coming up to him. They hold on to his cloak, confiding and fearless. 

 He gives the roses to them, caressingly lifting one after another into his arms, smiling the while that glorious smile which wins all hearts. 

  Again, we saw a cabman stop his fiacre, take off his cap and hold it in his hands, gazing amazed, with an air of reverence, whilst the majestic figure, courteously acknowledging  his salutation, passed by with that walk which a friend had described as "that of a king or of a shepherd." 

  Another scene. A very poor quarter in Pai~is — Sunday morning — groups of men and women inclined to be rowdy. Foremost amongst them a big man brandishing a long loaf of bread in his hand, shouting, gesticulating, dancing. 

 Into this throng walked Abdu'l-Baha, on his way from a Mission Hall where he had been addressing a very poor congregation at the invitation of their Pastor. The boister —  ous man with the loaf, suddenly seeing him, stood still. 

 He then proceeded to lay about him lustily with his staff of life, crying ~Make way, make way! He is my Father, make way." The Master passed through the midst of the crowd, now become silent 654

  and respectfully saluting him. tcT1~ank you, my dear friends, thank you," he said smiling round upon them. The poor were always his especially beloved friends. He was never happier than when surrounded by them, the lowly of heart! 

  Who is he? 

 Why do the people gather round him? 
     Why is he here in Paris?   
                           
     Shortly before Baha'u'llah  

 "returned to the shelter of Heaven," He laid a sacred charge upon his eldest son, cAbdu~1~Bahi (literally Servant of God, the Most Glorious).  This charge was that he should carry the renewed Gospel of Peace and Justice, Love and Truth, into all lands, with special insistence on the translating of all praiseworthy  ideals into action. What profit is there in agreeing that these ideals are good? Unless they are put into practice, they are useless. 

  I hope to indicate, albeit too inadequately, something of that Messenger, the tcTrusted One," who came out of an Eastern prison to bring his Father's message to the bewildered  nations of earth. During the Paris visit, as it had been in London, daily happenings  took on the atmosphere of spiritual events. 

 Some of these episodes I will endeavour to describe as well as I can remember them. 

 Every morning, according to his custom, the Master expounded the Principles of the Teaching of Baha'u'llah to those who gathered round him, the learned and the unlearned,  eager and respectful. They were of all nationalities and creeds, from the East and from the West, including Theosophists, Agnostics, Materialists, Spiritualists, Christian  Scientists, Social Reformers, Hindus, Sdf is, Muslims, Buddhists, Zoroastrians and many others. Often came workers in various Humanitarian societies, who were striving to reduce the miseries of the poor. These received special sympathy and blessing. 

  cAbdu~1~Bahi spoke in idnian which was translated into French by Monsieur and Madame Dreyfus-Barney. 

 My two daugh ters, Mary and Ellinor, our friend Miss Beatrice Platt, and I took notes of these ~'Ta1ks" from day to day. At the request of the Master, these notes were arranged and published in English.' It will be seen that in these pages are gathered together the precepts of those Holy Souls who, being Individual Rays of the ONE were, in divers times and countries, incarnated here on Earth to lead the spiritual evolution of human kind. 

  The words of cAbd~1Bahi can be put on to paper, but how describe the smile, the earnest pleading, the lovingkindness, the radiant vitality, and at times the awe-inspiring authority of his spoken words? The vibrations of his voice seemed to enfold the listeners in an atmosphere of the Spirit, and to penetrate to the very core of being. We were experiencing the transforming radiance of the Sun of Truth; henceforth, material aims and unworthy ambitions shrank away into their trivial obscure retreats. 

  Abdu'l-Baha would often answer our questions before we asked them. Sometimes he would encourage us to put them into words. 
     "And now your question?"   
he said.                   

 I answered, aj am wondering about the next world, whether I shall ask to be permitted  to come back here to Earth to help?" 

 "Why should you wish to return here? In My Father's House are many mansions — many, many worlds! Why would you desire to come back to this particular planet?" 

  The visit of one man made a profound impression upon us: "0 cAbdu~1~Bah~I I have come from the French Congo, where I have been engaged in mitigating the hardships  of some of the natives. For sixteen years I have worked in that country." 

 (cIt was a great comfort to me in the darkness of my prison to know the work which you were doing." 

 Explanations were not necessary when coming to tAbdu~1~Bahi!

656              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  One day a widow in deepest mourning came. Weeping bitterly she was unable to utter a word. 

 Knowing her heart's grief, c~Do not weep," said tAbdu'1-BaM, wiping away the tears from the piteous face. C~DO not weep! Be happy! It will be well with the boy. Bring him to see me in a few days." 

 On her way out, this mother said, t~~J my child! He is to go through a dangerous operation today. What can I do?" 

 CcTh Master has told you what to do. Remember his words: 'Do not weep, it will be well with the boy. 

 Be happy, and in a few days bring him to see me.' 

 In a few days the mother brought her boy to the Master, perfectly well. 

  One evening at the home of Monsieur and Madame Dreyfus-Barney, an artist was presented  to tAbdu'1-BahA. 
    ccThou art very welcome.   
I am happy to see thee.    

 All true art is a gift of the Holy Spirit." 
     "What is the Holy Spirit?" 
     ~cIt is the Sun of Truth,  

0 Artist!"                 
     ttWhere 0 where, is the    

Sun of Truth?"             
     ttThe Sun of Truth is everywhere.

 It is shining on the whole world." 

 ~tWhat of the dark night, when the Sun is not shining?" 

 ttThe darkness of night is past, the Sun has risen. 

 "But Master! how shall it be with the blinded eyes that cannot see the Sun's splendor?  And what of the deaf ears that cannot hear those who praise its beauty?" 

 ~ will pray that the blind eyes may be opened, that the deaf ears may be unstopped, and that the hearts may have grace to understand." 

 As tAbdu'1-Bah& spoke, the troubled mien of the Artist gave place to a look of relief, satisfied understanding, joyous emotion. 

  Thus, interview followed interview. Church dignitaries of various branches of the 

Christian Tree came. Some  

 earnestly desirous of finding new aspects of the Truth ~~ccthe wisdom that buildeth up, rather than the knowledge that puffeth up." Others there were who stopped their ears lest they should hear and understand. 

 One afternoon, a party of the latter type arrived. 

 They spoke word~ of bigotry, of intolerance, of sheer cruelty in their bitter condemnation of all who did not accept their own particular dogma, showing themselves  obsessed by ccthe hate of man, disguised  as iove of God" — a thin disguise to the penetrating eyes of the Master! Perhaps they were dreading the revealing light of Truth which he sought to shed upon the darkness of their outworn ecciesiasticism. The new revelation was too great for their narrowed souis and fettered minds. 

 The heart of tAbdu'1-Baha was saddened by this interview, which had tired him exceedingly. 

 When he referred to this visit there was a look in his eyes as if loving pity were blended with profound disapproval, as though he would cleanse the defiled temple of Humanity from the suffocating diseases of the soul! Then he uttered these words in a voice of awe-inspiring authority, "Jesus Christ is the Lord of Compassion, and these men call themselves by His Name! Jesus is ashamed of them."' He shivered as with cold, drawing his tabi closely about him, with a gesture as if sternly repudiating their misguided outlook. 
                           
     The Japanese Ambassador    

 to a European capital (Viscount Arawaka — Madrid) was staying at the H&tel d'J6na. This gentleman  and his wife had been told of tAbdu'1-Bah&'s presence in Paris, and she was anxious to have the privilege of meeting him. 

 ani very sad," said her Excellency. ttj must not go out this evening as my cold is severe and I leave early in the morning for Spain. 

 If only there were a possibility of seeing him!" 

 This was told to the Master, who had just returned after a long, tiring day. 

 ctTell the lady and her husband that, as she is unable to come to me, I will call upon her." 

 Accordingly, though the hour was late, through the cold and the rain he came, with his smiling courtesy, bringing joy to us all as we awaited him in the Tapestry Room. 

 tAbdu'1-Bah~ talked with the Ambassador and his wife of conditions in Japan, of the great international importance of that country, of the vast service to mankind, of


<p657>
SOJOURN OF tABDU'L-BAHA IN PARIS                               657

  the work for the abolition of war, of the need for improving conditions of life for the worker, of the necessity of educating girls and boys equally. 

 The religious ideal is the soul of all plans for the good of mankind. 

 Religion must never be used as a tool by party politicians. God's politics are mighty, man's politics are feeble. 

 Speaking of religion and science, the two great wings with which the bird of human kind is able to soar, he said, (CSi tifi discoveries have greatly increased material civilization. 

 There is in existence a stupendous  force, as yet, happily, undiscovered by man. Let us supplicate God, the Beloved, that this force be not discovered by science until Spiritual Civilization shall dominate the human mind! In the hands of men of lower material nature, this power would be able to destroy the whole earth." 

 Abdu'l-Baha talked of these and of many other supremely important matters for more than an hour. 

 The friends, wondering, said, "How is it possible that having spent all his life imprisoned in an eastern fortress, he should so well understand world problems  and possess the wisdom to solve them so simply?" 

 Truly we were beginning to understand that the majesty of greatness, whether mental or spiritual, is always simple. 

  One day, I received a disquieting letter, "It would be well to warn Abdu'l-Baha that it might be dangerous for him to visit a certain country, for which I understand he proposes to set forth in the near future." 

 Having regard to the sincere friendship of the writer, and knowing that sources of reliable information were available to him, this warning obviously could not be ignored. Therefore, as requested, I laid the matter before the 

Master.                    

 To my amazement, he smiled and said impressively, t~My daughter, have you not yet realized that never in my life have I been for one day out of danger, and that I should rejoice to leave this world and go to my Father?" 

 "Oh, Master! We do not wish that you should go from us in that manner." 

 I was overcome with sorrow and terror. 

 "Be not troubled," said tAbdu'1-BahA. "These enemies have no power over my life, but that which is given them from on High. If my Beloved God so willed that my lifeblood  should be sacrificed in His path, it would be a glorious day, devoutly wished for by me." 

 Therefore, the friends surrounding the much-loved master were comforted and their faith so strengthened, that when a sinister-looking man came to a group who were walking in the gardens and threateningly  said, "Are you not yet sufficiently warned? 

 Not oniy is there danger for tAbdu'1-Bahi, but also for you who are with him," the friends were unperturbed, one of them replying calmly, !cThe Power that protects the Master protects also His other servants. Therefore we have no fear." 

 The man departed, abashed, saying nothing  more. 

  Two days before the close of cAbdu~L~. Baha'is visit, a woman came hurriedly into the gathering at the Avenue de Gamo~ns: 'tOh how glad I am to be in time! I must tell you the amazing reason of my hurried journey from America. One day, my little girl astonished me by saying: cMummy if dear Lord Jesus was in the world now, what would you do?' tDarling baby, I would feel like getting on to the first train and going to Him as fast as I could.' tWell, Mummy, He is in the world.' I felt a great awe come over me as my tiny one spoke. tWhat do you mean, my precious? How do you know?' I said. ~He told me Himself, so in course He is in the world.' Full of wonder, I thought: Is this a sacred message which is being given to me out of the mouth of my babe? And I prayed that it might be made clear to me. 

 'tTh next day she said, insistently and as though she could not understand, tMummy, darlin', why isn't you gone to see Lord Jesus? 

 He's told me two times that He is really here, in the world.' tTiny love, mummy doesn't know where He is, how could she find Hun?' tWe see, Mummy, we see. 
     was naturally perturbed.   

 The same afternoon, being out for a walk with my child, she suddenly stood still and cried our,


<p658>
658              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  cThere He is! There He is!' She was trembling with excitement and pointing at the windows of a magazine store where was a picture of cAbdu~1~BahA. I bought the paper, found this address, caught a boat that same night, and here I am." 

 The above was written down as it was related to me. It is again the second instance  of the pictured face of cAbdu~1Bahi arresting the beholder with a compelling force. 

 The first incident was that of a man in deadly despair, about to take his own life; and now this innocent child! 

 It was of great interest to notice the effect the presence of CAbd~1Bh~ had upon some children. 

 One little girl whispered, "Look, that is Jesus when He was old." Perhaps their unstained nature sensed the breath of holiness which was always with Him and caused them to liken him to the Most Holy One of whom they were conscious. 

  One day a certain man of high degree came to cAbdu~1~Bah4. ~cj have been exiled from my country. 

 I pray you intercede for me that I may be permitted to return. 

 C(YOU will be allowed to return." 

 "Some of my land has been bought by one of the Baha'i friends. I desire to possess that property once more. 

 ttlt shall be given back to you and without  payment." 

 ctWho is the young man standing behind you? May he be presented to me?" 

 (cHe is ~Aga Mirza. Jalil, son of one of the martyred brothers of 1sf ihAn." 

 "I had no part in that crime. 

 ecThe part you took in that event, I know. Moreover, your motive I know." 

 This man, with his fellow conspirator, the tRVolf" (so named because of his ruthless cruelty and greed) had borrowed large sums of money from the two noble and generous brothers of I~faMn. To accuse them of being followers of Baha'u'llah, to bring them before a tribunal which condemned  them to be executed, and to have the brothers put to death, was their plot to avoid being required to repay the loans. 

  After the death of the ~'Wo1f" some documents were discovered, relating to the borrowed money. 

 This, with the addition of the interest which had accumulated, now amounted to a considerable sum. 

 The lawyer who was in charge of the affair wrote to the son of the martyr, asking into what bank the moneys should be paid. The reply sent, with the approval of cAbdu~1~Bahi was that he declined to accept repayment of money which had been one reason for the shedding of his father's blood. 

 cAga Mirza JalAl was now married to a daughter of eAbdu~1~Bahi. 

  Whilst these episodes were taking place, we who witnessed them seemed to be in a higher dimension where there were natural indications of the presence of the Light which in all men is latent and in cAbdu~1~ Baha transcendent. 

 The constant awareness of an exhilaration,  which carried us out of our everyday  selves, and gave us the sense of being One with the Life-Pulse which beats through the Universe, is an experience to be treasured rather than an emotion to be described.  The reader will understand that it is impossible to find fitting words for the thoughts and feelings which were with us in those Paris days.

RACIAL LIKENESSES AND
             DIFFERENCES: THE SCIENTIFIC
               EVIDENCE AND THE BAHA
                      TEACHINGS
                 B~ Louis G. GREGORY

     HE Baha'is of America      

 in their efforts to establish peace among warring races, religions  and nations, number among their varied activities three Summer schools, one of which is famous Green Acre, at Eliot, Maine. 

 The location of this center on the Piscataqua River and amid rural scenes of beauty is conducive to exhilaration as well as rest, and during the past forty years many great characters of various races have sought its stimulus and shelter. 

 This season's program, which extends through July and August, includes a course in race relations featuring racial likenesses and differences, conveying the scientific evidences and the Baha'i teachings. 

 It is conducted  by Genevieve L. Coy, Ph. D., for —  merly of Columbia University, now of the Dalton School of New York. The work goes deeply into the study of the socalled races, from the dawn of history until the present. It includes such topics as, 'What constitutes a race? 'What racial characteristics  prevailed in earliest history? 

 What parts of the earth were occupied? What color had peoples? What culture? 

 Interesting  facts brought out were that knowledge of color differences in early times is vague; that most scientists now recognize but three races; that differences between them arc not well defined; that all races are more or less mixed; that skin color is due to environment; that national culture is often mistaken for racial culture and that there is a tremendous racial admixture in the United States and South America. It is a wise provision of nature that those living under a tropical sun should be protected by a dark skin and woolly hair. On the other hand, some scientists are of the opinion that a very fair skin is a faded or bleached one. All shades are useful and beautiful. The early race was probably neither white nor black. The development of agriculture and the use of iron have sometimes been the means of separating races. 

 Another period was given to the discussion  of racial antipathies. 

 Factors in this are the survival of tribal clannishness; variance of religion; this enables some to regard themselves as the chosen of God and others accursed and unclean; dislike for what appears to be "new," "strange," and t~dif-ferent";  dissenting ideals of what constitutes physical beauty; tribal sense, that is, a belief that holding together is necessary to survival; trade and economic rivalries. 

 Even the cut of the beard in the past has been the means of separating peoples. It was brought out that physical differences which have slight foundation and are always superficial have unhappily had great effect in separating races. It cannot be denied by the thoughtful that racial differences conflict with the fundamentals of true religion. Yet how persistent are they! 

 The effort to measure the capacities of different groups or races by intelligence tests is interesting but exceedingly difficult in estimating results. The reason is that when backward races have the same cultural advantages their median and average intelligence rises. This may be illustrated by the higher rating of migrants from the South when given the advantage of better school 659

  systems in the North. 

 When the Negro lives on terms of equality with the whites, suffering no economic, social or cultural handicaps, it is quite reasonable to assume that he will measure up to the attainments of the whites in every particular. 

 Environment  and opportunity make all the difference. 

 The size of the brain is no gage of intelligence among races. All races see and hear equally well. 

 All are equally sensitive to covering the number of outstanding individuals; difference in temperament caused by physical conditions, such as climate; geographical differences, such as caused by mountain or valley, desert-dwelling or proximity to the sea; also nearness to and contact with other races. Also what effect has the possession of wealth, machinery and organization, all of which may be fortuitous? 

 Another interesting discussion centered  about the statement of Dr. Herbert The Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Karachi, India. 

  pain. All races show mechanical ingenuity and inventive ability. In brief, there are no marked racial differences. 

 Cultural differences and those due to climatic conditions there are. 

 Martinique is mentioned as one of the few places on earth where whites and blacks live together on a plane of social equality. 

 Here no difference in their respective  abilities is apparent. 

 Another very interesting period was that devoted to study of the causes of cultural differences in races. This comprehended such matters as differences in variability, Adoiphus Miller that suppressed races tend to be abnormally subjective, sensitive and aggressive. They are inclined to take everything upon the personal basis and to be unduly suspicious. 

 Representatives of minority groups present admitted this to be true. The statement is made by one who has been a lifelong friend of minority groups, Dr. Miller. It is, of course, one of the obstacles to racial understanding. 

 It is quite natural, however, in view of pressure from without. The Trojans fear the Greeks even when they come bearing gifts!


<p661>
RACIAL LIKENESSES AND DIFFERENCES                               661

  The subject of racial intermarriage was unemotionally discussed. Scientists agree that it increases fertility in races and is biologically sound. 

 In view of the prejudices against it, however, those who contract such alliances should have the zeal and courage of pioneers. 

  The climax of the week was the annual race amity conference, always one of the most fascinating features of the Green Acre season. The speaker at the opening session was Dr. Genevieve L. Coy, who had brought to light so many very interesting views during  the week of study. She said in part: ccThe rate of progress of any group, whether religious, national or racial, is, to a considerable degree, determined by its most intelligent and inventive members. A careful  study of the work of such distinguished artists, writers and musicians of the Negro race shows achievements of such excellence as to give a sound basis for the belief that the colored race as a whole will develop a fine and true appreciation of artistic and literary culture. 

 We may also expect that the Negro race will, in proportion to their numbers contribute as much to the culture of America as any of our other racial groups. 

 "In the field of literary achievement we call attention to the distinguished literary criticism of 

'William Stanley Braithwaite;

 to the colorful and forceful articles and books on racial problems of Dr. W. E. B. DuBois; to the novels of Jessie Fauset and Jean Toomer; to the dramatic and lyrical quality of the poetry of such writers as Claude McKay, 

Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes.

 In musical composition and execution,  we must take into account the contributions  to American art of such men as Nathaniel Dett, Carl Diton, Hall 

Johnson, Paul Robeson      

 and Roland Hayes. In the field of painting and sculpture we note the work of William Harper, 

William Scott, May Howard  
Jackson and Henry 0.       

 Tanner. Of these the most distinguished is Tanner, who is recognized as one of the leading painters of the world. He has been awarded knighthood in the French Legion of Honor. With such distinguished leadership, the Negro race should move forward into achievements of higher and finer standards in the fields of music, art, literature, as well as the liberal and industrial arts and sciences." 

 Mrs. Mary Coristine, a New Englander whose friendship for the colored race has been accentuated by her study of the Baha'i teachings, presided at the second session. She spoke briefly on the universal iove, which is on a higher plane than the mere personal love which is so subject to change. Louis G. Gregory spoke on the trend toward world fellowship, as illustrated in the attraction,  cooperation and blending of representatives of various races and religions both at home and abroad. Outstanding thinkers are beginning to see that a divided world is in danger of dissolution. People in all ranks of life are obtaining a vision of world fellowship,  sometimes articulate, sometimes more effectively expressed in service. This applies to both individuals and groups. Although  as yet these seers represent but a small minority of the people of the earth, they are imbued with a spirit that is all-pervasive. 

 They are the signs and rising places of a new culture. It is only a new and universal revelation of religion that can so train and educate mankind that all race prejudices vanish and all discords cease. 

 The Sunday morning session of the conference  was devotional, and the chairman, Mrs. Alice McCausland, read prayers and introduced Dr. Glenn A. Shook, professor at Wheaton College, as the speaker. The effort to unite various nations and peoples in past centuries, he declared, had fired the aspiration of men of genius. But in each case it has failed to bring permanent results. At this dark hour in human history man is especially in need of divine guidance. 

 This divine outpouring is caused by a new Manifestation. 

 How different would the history of the world have been had the established religions of the past maintained unity. Science has great value for man, but cannot alone accomplish such a task. 

 Some schools of science even deny divine revelation. Their god is only a great cosmic force, working for weal or woe. It is most refreshing to turn to the Baha teachings which satisfy every human need. The corn

  plete education of man comes through the Prophets of God who create spiritual life. Baha'i administration is a creation, a living organism, not a synthesis of the past. We may have all necessary parts of an organism, but we cannot put them together and cause life, nor make them work. The world of man is composite, but the divine Spirit is life. 

 This new divine outpouring alone is able to bring us out of our present chaos. 

 Prof. Stanwood Cobb of Washington presided  at the next session, given to general consultation and sociability. The unity of the world, he stated, would not be brought about through the effort to coordinate different  organizations, but rather through a spiritual consciousness of the oneness of mankind. The Golden Rule must be founded in minds and hearts. 

 We must think of the happiness and needs of others. An interesting incident related was the story told by Dr. Samuel C. Mitchell, distinguished  southern educator, of how his heart was fired when he saw and heard CAbd~1 Bab at the Lake Mohonk P~ace Conference in 1912 as the great message of human unity was proclaimed. 

 Rabbi Clark, visitor to Green Acre from the deep South, gave eloquent testimony of his admiration for the Baha religion. 

 He also paid a feeling tribute to the colored race and expressed the hope that this great nation would see the advantage to itself in giving every man a man's chance. Spreading love from heart to heart is a colossal undertaking. 

 We should not hold knowledge, but impart it. Give opportunities to all. My conviction is, he said, that a very high percentage  of the influence that directs people comes from their environment. Let us strive, therefore, to develop in all men their God-given powers for the adornment of the world, always seeking unity. It is deplorable that well-wishers of humanity cannot always be out spoken because of hostile and reactionary surroundings. A learned Rabbi was once asked to resign his pulpit because he upheld and applied in a sermon the principle of justice to a very critical matter in race relations. Because members of his congregation had business interests in that community, they feared harm if their leader took such a stand, though just. 

  Mrs. Margaret Cartwright  

 of Cambridge, a representative of the Youth Group, thereupon asked a challenging question: How are reactionary people to get the great message if those who know it do not teach, no matter what the sacrifice involved? 

 Rabbi Clark testified to his own stand for justice and the chairman, Prof. 

 Cobb, replied that people are greatly controlled by their emotions. This force with most mortals is more powerful than intellect. One emotion can only be overpowered by a greater emotion.  The reality of religion, divine love, is the Master emotion. This is the great security for a failing world. One vital flame of spiritual consciousness is enough to bring order and relief out of the great chaos that confronts mankind. Receptivity to the new ideals brings success. 

    Mrs. Elizabeth Greenleaf  

 said: "Speaking of the great conflict between intellect and emotion, I am reminded of my eaily experience  as a Baha'i worker. In my joy over the truth I wanted every one to accept it and was much discouraged by rebuffs. 

 But tAbdu'1-Bahi reassured me with three messages extending over a number of years. First, he said, CCB patient!" Anon he said, "Be divinely patient!" 

 Still later he said, ttBe magnificently patient!" 

  By the chairman: (cAll who work in movements of idealism are prone to pessimism.  They encounter so much crass selfishness in high and iow places that unless they be securely poised there is failure. 

 Politics and all the lower orders of human nature block the plans for advancement. 

 But idealism and realism must eventually be one. Let us not give up but rather fortify our. selves with the Spirit." 

 The final session of the conference was held in the People's Baptist Church of Portsmouth, N. H., whose pastor, Rev. Henry Benton Harris, is alive to progressive currents  in religion and human welfare. 

  Alfred E. Lunt, Esq., 

 of Boston, the principal speaker, declared that those who engage in strife know not the real meaning of life. They but pursue phantoms. Divisions based upon race, creed and color uphold that which is inconsequential. Yet such counterfeits in the present world exert a power which may destroy humanity. 

We


<p663>
RACIAL LIKENESSES AND DIFFERENCES                               663

 should seek to heal, not to wound. Infractions of divine law inevitably bring downfall.  Those who obey will become a part of the new world order. How can those who favor separation be true advocates of liberty? They array people against each other under false sanctions. They think by force to make all human beings conform to a single type, an idea not contemplated by God. It is most unfortunate to set prejudice in mo —  don, for one fatuity leads to another. Distinctions based upon artificial values have no standing in the sight of God. 

 Distinctions  not intended to create strife augment the beauty of creation. Healing for humanity  is realized when there is an inner resolve to help, keep the divine covenant and treat all men as brothers. When we live alone we are cut off from the divine reciprocity and protection. The first Baha'i principle is the oneness of humanity. 

 This ideal today is outstanding in a world of separation. 

 Because it is the call of God it must prevail. 

 A being comes into existence from every natural composition. 

 But an artificial composition produces no such re-suits. 

 Let us strive to be component parts of something that is real. The oppressed peoples of earth, whether at home or abroad, can find unity and freedom by working under the banner of Baha'u'llah. His spirit and teachings fulfill the expectations of all the ages. They bestow such vision as to enable men to see with the Eye of God. This enables the whites to uphold the standard  of justice in such a way as to be kind to the colored, and the latter on their part to be appreciative of and grateful to the former. 

 Embracing such an opportunity of service everyone can become the means of quickening and harmonizing humanity. 

 Maxwell Miller, also of Boston, argued that race prejudice is indefensible. 

 On the other hand, the force of cooperation is needed to upbuild community and world life. Cooperation and prejudice cannot meet for they express different and irreconcilable  planes. 

 The law of evolution which has applied in the growth of our country from a small group of colonies to forty-eight  states, will have its next application when it sees the greater values of the international spirit which binds all nations to-gecher. 

 gecher. The world must be one home. Vital factors in the new world order are wisdom and brotherhood. 

 There must also be the constant urge to translate words into deeds. Faith in the Supreme overcomes those precedents not founded upon reality and it inspires the courage to apply the remedy that heals. 

 The Baha'i teachings make a special appeal to the youth of the world. They ennoble, with the joy of working  for the highest ideals under the sanction of religion. Ideals having a human origin often degenerate in their realization. 

 But divine ideals are in perpetuity. They inspire the highest efficiency and involve no waste of life. 

 Dr. Genevieve Coy made brief references to the week's course at Green Acre and how scientific evidence had been gathered to refute prejudices. 

 Those who insist upon separating humanity become far less dogmatic  when they truly investigate likenesses. 

 Merit and deeds must be the basis of preferment among mortals, not superficial barriers that have no significance. 

 The bibliography of the study class, in addition to the Baha'i literature, included the works of the most standard authors, authorities both foreign and domestic white and colored. The list included: Boas, K — Anthropology and

 This conference attracted to Green Acre a varied and interesting company of friends representing many cities of America and some foreign lands. As the purpose of Green Acre is the study of reality, those who have watched its progress during the years are more than ever pleased with the combined uses of science and religion to brighten minds, solace hearts and to demonstrate, as in a laboratory, the right methods  of solving the vexing problems of humanity.

DENMARK'S ORIENTAL SCHOLAR
                  B~ MARTHA L. ROOT

  DENMARK, one of the oldest countries in Europe, with its beautiful capital, Copenhagen,  the gateway from Western Europe to the great Northlands of the midnight sun, Scandinavia, is making unique contribution to the scholarly investigation of the Baha'i Faith. It is significant that this ever unconquered  nation of three and onehalf millions of people with no illiterates and where almost every farmer has his own library and is an indefatigable reader, in the midst of this cultured, well-balanced race, the Baha'i Teaching from IrAn has been written about historically by one of Denmark's  most outstanding scholars, the first Danish savant to go to Ir4n. 
  Professor Arthur Christensen,

Doctor of Letters, Professor

 of I r6nian Philology in the University of Copenhagen, member of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Letters of Denmark, has made three trips to fr&n — in 1914, 1929, 1934, this last time as first vice-president of the International 

Firdawsi Congress in Tibrin

 to celebrate the milk-nary anniversary of the great poet of Iran. His purpose was to study IrAnian dialects and civilization also, but just as in the case of the distinguished 

English scholar, Professor 
Edward Granville Browne    

 of Cambridge University, England, he found an interesting subject opened for him by the literature of the Bab and Baha'u'llah. 

   Visiting the Royal Library 

 in Copenhagen  in June, 1935, I found in its excellent collection of Baha'i books an extraordinary fr&nian manuscript containing 

Tablets of Baha'u'llah.     

 The catalogue notes revealed that it had been bought in Tihr4n in 1914, by Professor Arthur Christensen for this library. It contains one hundred and eighty-one short Tablets. 

 The same afternoon the writer visited Professor Christensen in his home, set in the centre of a charming Danish garden. 

 It was pleasant, too, to see cAbdu~1~BahA~s picture on the wall of his great library. When asked about the manuscript, this genial Professor said he had bought it from a Muslim book dealer in TihrAn, that it has no titles (Iranian manuscripts do not have titles), and contains some Writings of Baha'u'llah. One is the Tablet addressed to Sult4n cAbdu~1~cAziz Sul~n of Turkey, the very 

Tablet that Professor      

 E. G. Browne in the ccJournal of the Asiatic Society," 1889, said he was not able to procure in Inn. 

     Professor Christensen      

 is not himself a Baha'i because as he said: typ a religious point of view, in general all deeply religious feelings are alien to me, but there is in the Baha'i Movement something with which I am in sympathy; it appeals to me because it is international and because there must be something in it which evokes good moral sentiments. 

 I saw that all the Baha'is in Iran with whom I had anything to do possessed high morals and noble human qualities. No doubt it is a cultural movement." 

 Continuing, he said: "Often I have discussed  the main Teachings, especially with well known Baha'is in Itdn, but I have had difficulty in sharing with them their bright outlook on the future which seemed to me indicates an underyaluation of the slowness in development due to the knottiness of all human conditions and of the enormous weighing down of the inferior element in humanity. However, if one has a use for divine Manifestations and prophethood and such things, it seems to me that the Baha'i Movement in somewhat higher degree than other socalled divine Revelations is purified from absurdities of thought such as made one of the ancient church fathers use the expression: ~1 believe because it is incredible!' and which in our days causes so many religiously inclined people to feel homeless 665

  in the existing systems of thousand-year-old religions. 

 You will not lack warmth of faith in the enthusiastic, prophetical Words of Baha'u'llah or in the intensive, persuasive speech of tAbdu'1 — Bah4 which bear witness to His wide grasp of humanity. 

 Here is a religion which does not need theology because  its principles, that is to say, its background of civilization and individual and social psychology, are those of our times." 

 natural cordiality; they lived for their ideal, an ideal in which there was just as much of sound and practical morality as of religious tenets." 

  Professor Christensen      

 has written among his many books two in which the Baha'i Cause is explained; one, ttHinsides det Kaspiske 

HaY' ("Beyond the Caspian  

 Sea"), published in 1918, Gyldendaiske Boghandel, Copenhagen, in which Chapter Ten is en-ProLessor ProLessor Arthur Christensen of Copenhagen, hagen, Denmark. 

 "If a religion," said the Danish Professor, ttj~ to be judged by its influence on men, one should not forget that the Baha'i community  in the corrupt, sectarian, suppressed Inn of the Q6jir dynasty was the germ from which grew a renaissance! Adherence to the Baha'i Faith could at that time in Iran and probably still can be taken in tr~n as a guarantee for personal honesty and unselfish  helpfulness to a reasonable degree." 

 When I spoke of his high tribute to the Baha'is of Ir~n in his book published in 1918, he replied: "Yes, I can endorse what I said then, for personally I have only good memories of the Baha'is I met in I r~n. They were trustworthy, courageous, helpful people. 

 They always met me with radiant, titled "Together with Baha'is." This is an account of the Movement in its evolution to a World Religion; it also gives Professor Christensen's meetings with leading Baha'is in Tilirin and their discussions about the new Faith. It contains an excellent reproduction of the Baha Temple, Mashriqu'l-Adhkar,  in Ishqabad, Turkist~n, from a photograph taken in 1914. Another one of his volumes, ccDet 

Gamle og det Nye Per-(The  

 Old and the New Persia"), 1930, I Kommission hos G. IL. Gad, Copenhagen, in two places mentions the BThi Movement which developed into the Baha'i Cause. 

      The magazine, "Nordisk     
Tidskrift" ("The Magazine  
of the North"), in 1911

             DENMARK'S ORIENTAL SCHOLAR

  had an article by Professor 

Christensen on "A Modern  

 Oriental Religion" which he wrote before his f4rst trip to Inn; it is an historical sketch of the BTh and early Baha'i events. This magazine for science, art and industry of Sweden, 

Norway, Denmark and Finland

 contains articles by representative writers of these four northern countries. Professor Christensen said that the account of the Bibi-BaM'i Movement which he presented  in his book, "Beyond the Caspian Sea" contains the main points that are in this article. 

    Professor Christensen     

 also has written about the Movement for some Danish encyclopaedias, the Salmonsens Konversations-lexikon, last edition, and for the new Illus-treret  Dansk Konversationslexikon, 1933; also several Danish newspaper articles about the Baha'i Teachings have appeared under his signature. t(Berlingske Aften," Copenhagen,  November seventh, 1932, contains a special feature article by this celebrated Professor under the headlines "En 

Moderne Verdensreligion"  

 and in it he also reviews the Danish translation of Dr. J. E. Essle-mont's book, CCBah4~u~1Uh and the New Era," which had just been published by 

Nyt Nordisk Forlag, Arnold

 Busck, Copenhagen. No other Scandinavian scholar until now has written so fully about the Baha'i Movement  as has Professor Arthur Christensen of Copenhagen, whose works are well known among Oriental scholars of the Eastern as well as the 'Western world. 

 His influence will continue to bear fruit.

                  B~ LIDJA ZAMENHOF

  EN aiuj tempoj 'a homa menso Jevadis sin super 'a aferojn de la 6iutaga vivo, por serai Ia verojn kaj legojn, regantajn la homojn kaj la universon. 

 Grandaj filozofoj postlasadis sistemojn; tiuj sisternoj of te bildis Ia pens-manieron de La epoko, kaj kune estis of te por la membroj de tin epoko fundamento, sur kiu iii bazis siajn konceptojn. 

 La pasinta jarcento vidis naskifton de nova granda penso, kiu aperis en Persujo sub la norno ccBah63smo,~~ kaj el sia orienta naski~-loko disvastigas tra la mondo. 

 La filozofiaj principoj de tiu movado estas konataj al La okcidentanoj aefe ella verkoj kaj paroloj de Abdu'l-Baha la fib de la fondinto de la Baha Movado, Baha'u'llah. Ofte ii re-spondadis  al diversaj prezentitaj al ii de-mandoj, kaj la &faj principoj de Ia Baha filozoflo kiare elaperas en liaj respondoj. Esplorante la &fajn trajtojn de la Baha filozoflo ni turnu ninunue al do, kio nin airkafias, al la naturo, kaj ni vidu, kio gi estas kaj kia gi estas. 

 La naturo, lail tAbdu'1-BahA estas tiu stato, tiu realajo, k~u konsistas, unuavide, el vivo kaj morto, aji, dirante ph precize, el kombini~ado kaj malkombinigado. Ciuj formoj de la kreitajaro estas rezulto de kombinado. 

 Certaj atomoj, kunligitaj per la forto de altirado, kreas delikatan kaj aroman floron, aliaj kreas la homan korpon, aliaj amasigas, por doni formon al giganta suno. 

 Neniu el Ia formoj estas eterna. Kiam la povo de altirado, kiu cementis Ia tuton, &sas efiki, la kombinajo malkombini-gas kaj venas tio, kion, rilate al la vivaj estajoj, ni nomas morto. La morto ne estas tamen por Ia materio nenugo, nur trans-formifto. 
La atomoj ne pereas.       

 Kiam de-nove  ekagos je iii altira forto, iii formos novajn formojn, ~is kiam ankaii tiuj novaj formoj, subigante al Ia sorto de ejo kom-binita, jam malkombiniftos. Tiun ~i princi-pon  la moderna scienco konas sub la nomo ccki~ de Ia materio." 

 La naturon, t.e. stataron de La ekzisto, orn povas dividi en keLkajn klasojn, el kiuj du maipli alta estas ~tupo kaj grado, tra kiu evoluas la supera kiaso. Tiel sur la plej malalta ~tupo trovigas Ia regno de mineraloj. Iii havas nek inteligentecon, nek instinkton, nek movkapablon. 
Ilia sola atributo estas —  ekzisto.

 Tamen la mineralo, solvita en La tero, donas vivon al kiaso ph alta, al La vegetaja regno. La regno de vegetajoj, bazita sur tiu de mineraloj, posedas kune kun iii Ia atributon de ekzisto, sed fti superas la mineralan regnon per speciala kapablo, la kreskokapablo, kiu estas fremda al 'a mineralo. 

 La vegeta~a regno, siavice, pre-zentas  ~tupon, tra kiu evoluas la besta regno. Tiu ~i regno, krom la ecoj de la minerala kaj vegetaja regnoj, sur kiuj fti apogas sin, posedas atributojn fremdajn al la antaiiaj klasoj, t.e. movokapablon, instinktojn kaj sentojn. 

 Kaj super tiuj S klasoj, kid ilia krono, trovas sin kreitalo la plej perfekta, Ia homo. 

 Li heredis de Ia antaiiaj regnoj iliajn atributojn — la ekziston, kreskopovon, mov-kapablon  kaj sentojn. 

 Per Ia atributoj de sia fizika ekzisto Ii ne multe diferencas de Ia besta regno. Same kiel la besto, la homo estas dependa, por sia fizika bonstato, de aero, akvo, nutrajo, de certa minimumo kaj maksimumo de temperaturo. Ofte e6 Ia kapabloj de ha korpo malsuperas tiujn de Ia bestoj. 

 Li ne povas kompari sian flaron kun Ia flaro de hundo, sian vidon kun la vido de aglo, sian lertecon kun la lerteco de simio, sian forton kun la forto de leono. 

 Kaj la grandegan diferencon inter La besto kaj Ia homo oni devas serei ne en la ecoj kaj kapabloj de ha fizika korpo. La dis-tingajo,  kiu levas Ia bomon super Liujn antaiiajn regnojn, estas ha intelekto, tiu form abstrakta sed potenca, kiu permesas al La horno, apartenanta fizike al Ia mondo de naturo, altifti super tiun ~i mondon kaj grandparte skiavigi gin al si. 668

  Observante Ia naturon, ni devas rirnarki, ke gi estas blinda skiavo de la le~oj, kiuj gin regas. 

 Vere, tiuj le~oj trapenetras ~in kun tiei mirinda precizeco kaj harmonjo, ke ~ajnas, kvazaZi iii venus de la naturo mem.

  ekziston de iu supera Volo, de kiu devenas 'a elementoj kaj kiu p~as jun unujn al la aliaj. 

 La Bahija filozoflo akceptas ekziston de Superega Volo, kiu regas la Universon kaj estas gia legodonanto. 

 Tiu Superega Potenco estas nornata Dio. 

 Multaj homoj neas la ekziston de tiu Supera Potenco. 

 Ih~ argumentas, ke iii povas ftin nek percepti, nek koncepti. Sed tin argumento pruvas nur, ke nia homa menso estas lirnigita kaj super la destinitan al si kompren-sferon ne povas levigi. Por koi~-preni ion au iun nefesas, ke la komprenanto estu almena5 egaigrada kun la komprenato. Plej potenca roko, plej pura diarnanto neniel povas koncepti 'a misteron de la germanta semo, aar la ~ermokapab1o estas frernda al mineralo kaj estas super ~ia sfero. Same plej potenca kverko ne povas kopreni birdon, kiu nestas en gia foliaro, saltas tie branao al braneo kaj kantas melodie, turn-ante la kapeton por a~di kanton de alia birdo — car la movopovo de la besta mondo, giaj instinktoj kaj kapabloj estas frerndaj e'& al plej perfekta vegetajo. 

 Kaj siaflanke besto, eu formiko, ~u ele-fanto, neniel povas koncepti tioQ, kio estas konceptebla por la homo intelekto — fti ne komprenas la 1e~ojn, kiuj regas la naturon kaj kiujn Ia horno grandaparte fleksis al sia volo — gi vidas kaj atidas fulmotondron, sed ne komprenas Ia elektron kaj ne scias apliki gian forton al siaj bezonoj. 

 ti vidas briletojn sur Ia nokta ajelo, sed ne kom-prenas,  ke tiuj briloj estas mondoj, nestantaj en Ia senlima waco de la universo. 

 Ti~1 do, ear nenjo, staranta sur unu grado de ekzisto, povas kompreni tion, kio estas sur ph aLa grado, ankau Ia homo, kvankam Ii estas plej alta el la kreitoj, sed tarnen nur kreito, neniel povas kornpreni Ia senkompare superantan un Krean Potencon. Por povi kompreni Dion, ii devus esti egala al Dio. Sc Ii prezentus al Si iOfl egalan al si mem, ho ne estus Dio. La homo povas kompreni nur don, kion ii povas imagi, kaj povas imagi mu tion, kion ii povas kompreni. Dion ii povas nek imagi, nek kompreni. Tio, kion ii kapablus imagi kaj kompreni, ne estas Dio. 

 La mineralo ne povas imagi kaj kompreni La kreskokapablon de La floro — maigrail tio Ia floro kreskas, burgonas kaj floras. La besto ne pans kompreni la eltrovajojn de la homa intelekto, maigrati tio la homo skiavi-gas la elektron en telegraf an fadenon kaj transportas sin de lando al lando per potenco de 'a vaporo. 

 Kaj same, La homo ne povas kompreni Ia Superegan Potencon, sed tiu supera Potenco ekzistas malgrafl kaj super ha kompreno, kaj tenas un en sia povo. 

 Kia estas la rilato de tiu krea Potenco aL Ia kreajoj? ~i estas kiel tiu de aiitoro al sia verko, kiel tiu de suno aI Ia planedo, al kiu ~i donas la lurnon, varmon kaj vivon. La suno mern restas en sia loko kaj ne forlasas gin, por kontaktigi kun Ia planedo. La varmo kaj lumo emanas de la suno al La planedo, sed Ia suno men-i ne dispartigas, por veni sur La teron. 

 Same la skribajo ernanas de la skribanto kaj kanto ernanas de La kantanto, sed la skribanto ne transformigas mem en la skribalon nek Ia kantanto en N kanton. 

 Alie okazas, ni dim, en la ekzemplo de arbo, kreskanta el Ia semo. 

 Tiam okazas ne emanado, sed transforrni~o, ~ar la semo mem transforrni~as en Ia kreskajon, kiu naski~as ci fri kaj je gia kosto. 

 La semo mem ~an gas sian formon, kaj kid tiu ~ semo, &sas ekzisti. 

 La krea Potenco ne transformi~as en la kreajojn. ti restas 6iam en sia esenco sende-penda, neelaerpebla, nedispartigebla, nedi —  videbla. La rilato inter Ia krea Pot~nco kaj Ia kreitajoj estas do la rilato de emanado. 

 Tiu krea Potenco estas absolute sende-penda. 

 Sendependa de ten-ipolimoj, 6ar ~i ekzistis aiam kaj daiiros 6iam. Nenia komenco kaj nenia fino por p ekzistas. La tempo mem, sekve, rilate al fti ne ekzistas, ~ar tempo estas mezurata per templimoj, kaj kie la templimoj ne ekzistas, kian signifon havas la tempo? 

 Tiu krea Potenco estas ankaii sendependa en sia Esenco, aar ftia ekzisto ne estas sekvo de iu antaiia kajizo, same kiel neniu kaiizo povas med finon al gi. 

 Kaj tiamaniere, sen komenco kaj fino, sen kaiizo kaj konsumigo, gi estas Ia Alfo kaj Omego de Ia ekzisto. 

 Krea Potenco, singnifas — la Potenco, kiu kreas. La kreado estas aiama, kiel la krea Potenco mem. La koncepto mem pri Ia Krea Potenco sen Ia kreo estus nelogika, kid koncepto pri instruanto sen instruato, pri donanto sen ricevanto, pri SUflO Sen radioj. Sed Ia radioj de Ia suno, kvankam tie1

Kaj Ia kreita uni-verso,  kvankarn rilate al la tempo senko-menca kaj senfina, en sia esenco, t.e. en sia kajizo, dependas de La Krea Potenco, Ia Unua Kajizo. di estas do absoluta rilate al la tempo, sed ne rilate al Ia esenco, aar en sia esenco gi estas ernanajo de La krea Potenco. 

 Tamen la ekzisto, kvankam eterna, ne estas eterna en sia formo. KiM ni diris anta&, &iu formo konsistas el certa korn-bino, kaj do, kio foje estis kombinita, nepre devas jam esti malkombinita. 

 La da~ro de iu formo povas esri kelkaj tagoj, kiel vivo de insekto, aii miliardoj da jarrniloj, kiel ekzisto de sun-sistemo, sed eterneco kaj absoluto rilate al la formo neniel elzistas. Kiel fenikso, la mondo de ekzisto 2iam renaski~as ella propraj cindroj. 

 Kiel peli —  kano, per Ia propra sango ~i nutras siajn idojn. 

 En la mondo de kreiteco ne ekzistas haLo kaj staro. 

 La konstanta movado, K kon-stanta  ~angado estas Ia le~o de la naturo. 

 Se birdo ekhaltus en sia flugo, ~i falus. Same Ia astroj ne povas ekhalti en sia kurado, nek la organismoj en sia evoluado. Haiti, ne in plu antatien, signifas in malantailen. Tiel la homo kreskas kaj maturigas, ~is Ii atingas sian plej eblan staton de evoluo. 

 Kaj kiam plua evoluo ne estas ebla, kornenci~as Ia malevoluo, Ia maiprogreso de Ia korpo te. la maijunigado, gis venas la morto kaj metas finon al tiu ai formo de ekzisto, kiu estis La homa korpo. 

 De kie venas lahomo? Cu Ia homa speco dekomence ekzistis kiel speco homa, dis-tingi~anta  de Ia besta mondo, aji au ~i estas rezulto de longega evoluado, eliranta ci la besta regno? 

 El Ia anatomia konstruo de la homa korpo, el Ia konstruo de ha vertebra kolonaro oni konkludas, ke jam, en Ia frua epoko de sia evoluado, la homo havis voston. El do kaj ci similaj premisoj kelkaj deduktas, ke Ia homo devenas de besto. 

 Sed tiu de —  dukto estas erara. Car tiuj premisoj mon-tras  nur, ke la homo evoluis, ke en iaj pra —  tempoj de sia ekzisto Ii, homo, havis voston, simile al Ia besto, sed laligrade, kiel Ia speco evoluis, tiu organo ne estis plu bezona kaj join post join malaperis. Nenjo tuj venas en la ekziston en sia perfekta formo. do evoluas, pasante de Ia originaj prirnitivaj forrnoj al forrnoj ajam ph perfektaj. 

 En la komenco de la evoluado Ia evoluanta estajo povas ankora~ forte malsimili de La poste atingota formo, tamen La evoluado okazas ciam en la kadroj de Ia speco. 

 Nek gi vents ci trans Ia limoj de La speco, nek ~i jam trapasos tiujn limojn. Tiel Ia roza arbusto, koyrita de florantaj bonodoraj rozoj, forte malsirnilas de Ia senaspekta serno, el kiu ~i naskigis. Rigardante la sernon, Ia gardenisto scias, kjon gi kasas en si kaj idon ~ aperigos, sed persono nekompetenta pri la gardenkul-turo povas kredi, ke el tiu serno naskiftos eble violo, aii eble potenca arbo. 

 Krom la individua evoluado ekzistas speca evoluado — tiel la rozo povas evolui de Ia kvinpetala modesta floro ~is Ia re~ino de niaj ~ardenoj, dank' al la sa~a flegado de Ia kul-turisto.  Sed aam gi estos rozo. Kid ajn gi povus evolui, neniam ~i i~os Ijijo aii kverko. Kaj kiam ni vidas rozon, ni scias, ke ae gia komenco estis roza semo, dotita potenciale per Ciuj kvalitoj de Ia roz-speco. Ne estas eble imagi, ke 'a roza speco evoluis, ni diru, el traiko. 

 Kaj ankati & la komenco de sia pratempa evoluado la homa gento estis Ham homa gento, aparta de da besta speco. Vere, lali sia aspekto, vivrnaniero, lingvo ~i povis simdi Ia beston. Sed sirnileco ne signifas identen-con. 

 Kiel en la ekzemplo de Ia rozo, en Ia pratempo de Ia homa gento ekzistis jam Ia poste aperontaj kvalitoj, kiuj markos la diferencon inter homo kaj besto. Kiel en Ia ekzernplo de Ia rozo, tiuj kvalitoj ne tUj elmontri~is, sed kvankam ne elmontritaj, iii ekzistis potenciale kaj ekfloris, kiarn venis la tempo. La evoluado de Ia horna gento similas Ia evoluadon de Ia horna individuo. Komence la embrio neniel similas Ia maturan hornon. En certa stadjo de la evoluo fti ea, similas fi~on. 

 Kaj tarnen de la kornenco ~i estas horna embrio, dotita per aiuj homaj kvalitoj kaj perfektecoj, kiuj elrnontngos en Ia posta grado de Ia evoluo de Ia individuo. 

 Ne el Ia besta regno devenas Ia homo. La homa speco estis ~iam speco aparta, speco supera a! Ia regnoj minerala, vegetaja kaj besta. 

 Krom la korpo, kiu prezentas Ia fizikan, videblan parton de la homa estajo, Ia bahaa filozoflo distingas en homo animon, menson

  k aj spiriton. Per la animo oni komprenas la movantan forton de la korpo. Se la animo kro~as sin al Ia mondo materiala, gi restos malluma, ear gi transprenos &iujn malper-fektecojn de la materiala mondo, kiel avidecon, voluptamon, egoismon. 

 La menso estas tiu kapablo, per kiu la homo malkovras la sekretojn de la ekzisto kaj ekkonas juan esencon. 

 La animo, lumigita per Ia lumo de la intelekto, levas sin super la bestan, ma —  terialan mondon. Kaj la esprimo ttla homa spirito" signifas guste dun animon, dotitan per intelekto. 

 Tiu intelekta animo, estante abstrakta, ne dependas de loko. ti ne enkorpigas en la hornan korpon kaj en sia ekzisto gi ne de —  pendas de la korpo, sed estas kun gi ligita, kiel lurno, respegulanta sin en spegulo, estas ligita kun la spegulo. La lumo ne dependas de Ia spegulo. 

 Kiam rompigas la spegulo, la lumo plie brilas. Pile ea, se en la mondo ekzistus nenia Limo, ~u la spegulo entute estus imagebla kaj uzebla? Ankau rilate al la korpo kaj spirito — esenca estas la spirito, ~ar sen gi Ia korpo ne havus signifon. Kaj kiel Ia lumo ne pereas maigrail la rompo de Ia spegulo, ankaii Ia spirito ne pereas malgraii Ia detruo de la korpo. 

 La korpo en sia esenco estas morterna, aar estante konribinita, gi devas malkombinigi. Sed Ia spirito ne konsistas el atomoj, fti ne estas kombinita, fti ne malkombinigas, gi ~ pereas. Malligita de la korpo, fri plue vivos en Ia propra sfero, en la regno de spirito, kie gi eterne evoluos, celante la perfektecon. 

 Nia surtera vivo estas por nia spirito kvazaii Ia vivo de embrio en la patrina sino. En Ia stato de embrieco la homa estajo kapa —  bias nek kompreni, nek ea imagi la mondon, en kium gi venos poste. Vere, ~i havas jam la okulojn, sed iii ankorai~ ne vidas. 

 Gi havas orelojn, sed Ia atidopovo manifesti~os nur post Ia veno en Ia mondon. 

 La ekstera mondo atendas gin, plena de beleco, sed vane La embrio en la patrina sino dernandus, ekzemple, kio estas Ia !t~ie1arko?~~ Ne, tia demando mem estas neirnagebla! Kaj vane gi demandus, por kio servas La okuloj. La patrino mem scias tion, sed kiarigi al Ia ido ne estas eble.

 Kaj komprenante tiun &i veron, la homo ne devas, dum sia surtera ekzistoparto, glui sian animon al Ia mondo de argilo kaj koto. Li devas zorfe flegi 'a flugilojn de la spirito, por ke ii povu flugi, kiam venos la tempo. 

 Tamen, kiagrade la homo estas libera en sia celado? 

 tu ii, kreito, ne dependas entute de La kreinta un Potenco? Tiu krea Povo, estante absoluta, havas la scion pri &iu homa ago, tiuj homaj agoj estas do kvazaii en-skribitaj  en Ia libro de destino. tu estas do eble konrraiThtari 'a antaildestinitan sorton? 

 La antaiiscio ne estas kaiizo de la destino. Ekzemple nun ni eiuj scias, ke post kelkaj horoj la suno ka~os sin sub La horizonto, sed tiu nia antaiiscio ne estas kaiizo de 'a fakto, kontra~e, gi mem venas de tiu fakto. La astronomoj scias de antatie, kiam okazos la eklipso de Ia suno, sed ilia scio ne estas kalizo de Ia sun-eklipso. 

 Same, kvankam en la antaiiscio de Ia Plej Supera Krea Potenco enskribita estas ma sorto, tiu antaiiscio ne signifas destinon, gi estas nur unu el Ia atributoj de 'a Krea Potenco. 

 La sorto estas duspeca: nepra kaj akci-denta. 

 Por kiarigi Ia diferencon, ni uzu ekzemplon. Lati sia nepra destino la suno devas brili kaj de la mateno gis la vespero lumigi la teron. Sed sorto akcidenta ail hazarda povas kalizi, ke nubo aperas inter la suno kaj la tero kaj detenas de Ia tero la sunajn radiojn. 

 LaMestine, kiam oelo en lampo konsumi-gas,  la lampo nepre devas estingigi. 

 Sed povas okazi, ke ee antail la konsumifro de Ia oleo hazarde forta vento estingos Ia flamon.

Same ~tono ne estas respondeca, &x fti estas jetita por frakasi jes kranion, aii ~ estas metita kid bazo de ternplo. Konscic, libervole celi aL hi perfekteco — jen la merito de la homo.

Per Ia malfacilajoj ni lernas kaj hardi~as. Sen iii ni estus neelprovitaj. Ju ph granda estas la sufero, des ph granda estas la rikolto de Ia spiritaj virtoj, elmontritaj en la homo. 

 La gojo iafoje igas la homon memfida kaj forgesema. 

 Sed kiarn venas Ia mal~ojo, La homo rememoras sian n-ialgrandecon kaj senpoveon, kaj turnas sin supren, al la supera Potenco, kiu sola havas la povon savi un el liaj malfacilajoj. 

 Kaj del degelas ha memfido kaj kreskas ha spiriteco. 
     Doloro ne signifas malbonon.

 Hirurgiisto, tranCanta la malsanan korpon, ka~zas dolo —  ron, sed ne faras malbonon. 

 Pozitiva malbono, lali la bahaa folozoflo, ne ekzistas. Se la krea Potenco estus kreinta malbonon, fri estus neperfekta. 

 En Ia kreajo lie ekzistas malbono. do estas bona. 

 Tio, kion ni nomas malbono, estas nur manko ati malforta grado de bono. Homo tie1 nomata malbona estas homo, kies ph alta naturparto ne estas ankoraii disyolvita, dum viglas la maipli alta, besta patio de ha naturo. 

 Kiam disvolvi~os Ia parto ph alta, La ~isnuna malbonulo i~os bonulo. Sc ii estas memarna, Ia malbono ne konsistas en ha amo al si mem, ear eja amo, e& la propra, estas born. 

 La malbono konsistas en tio, ke tiu amo estas direktita ekskluzive al Ii mem, ne al aliaj. La malbono konsistas do en manko de amo al la aliaj. Kiam al hi alija direktigos ha amo, ne ekzistos plu Ia egoismo. Same avideco en sia esenco ne estas malbona3ar deziro je io plia estas stimulilo de Ia pro-gresso.  La malbono ku~as en do, ke Ia deziro direktigas al celoj materialaj, anstata~ al la spiritaj. 

 Tie do, kie ni kredas ma1-bonon,  estas nur manko de bono, manko de harmonjo. Tiel ankau Ia venena serpento ne estas io malbona: Ia veneno estas ja gia armilo, per kiu fri defendas sin. Sed 6ar mankas harmonjo inter giaj elementoj kaj la niaj, pro tio, rilate al ni, la venena serpento aperas kid malbona. 

 La homo devas peni, ke la besta parto de ha naturo neniel superregu La spiritan parton. La supereco kaj evoluo de la spirita parto devas esti ha celo, Ia kialo de ha vivo. 
     Kiel atingi dun celon?

La gojoj estas kreitaj por ni, por ke ni uzu jim, kondiae nur, ke ni ne donu al iii tro da loko, ke ni ne permesu a! iii ekposedi nin. Kaj Ia korpa malforteco ne estas virto. Paralizito povas neniun frapi, mutulo ne povas mensogi, sed tio ne estas virtoj. La horno devas lerni ne bad, havante fortan brakon kaj me mensogi, havante sanan langon. 

 Tio & estas Ia vera mildeco kaj boneco. 

 Rigardante la homojn, ni vidas, ke iii ~iuj apartenas al La sama, hon-ia, speco.

<p675>
THE BAHA MOVEMENT

 B~ REN WICK J. G. MJLLAR My first acquaintance with the Baha'i Movement and teachings occurred some years ago when I received a communication from Mr. E. T. Hall of Manchester, England.  Mr. Hall had happened to see one or two copies of the local Journal which I edit, and from the tone of its editorial and other articles he judged that some indication of Baha'i principles would not be unacceptable. His letter was duly published, and ever since then an interesting and intimate correspondence  has been kept up between us. Subsequently I had the pleasure of receiving many Baha'i publications — books, magazines  and pamphlets — so that by this time I am probably better informed concerning the Movement and all it stands for than any other journalist in the country. (This I count a privilege and an education.) These publications I reviewed, sometimes briefly and sometimes more fully, in the ordinary course of my journalistic work. 

 The reviews  or notices were kindly spoken of and I fear rather highly appraised by Mr. Hall and other Baha'is who did me the honor of reading them, and I have been the recipient  of many warm — too warm — words of appreciation. 

 But the reaction of my readers to these thoughts was practically nil. 

 Nothing has surprised me more than to learn that my treatment of Baha'i publications  as a journalist has been exceptional if not unique in British newspapers. 

 Why it should be so I am at a ioss to understand. The British Press in general has a worldwide reputation for the freedom it affords for the discussion of all shades of opinion emanating from thoughtful minds. If an exception is deliberately made in so far as Bahi'ism is concerned, it must surely be due to some strange misunderstanding. 

 Can it be that, as it was asked of old by Nathanael, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" 

 so it is tacitly assumed that no good suggestion or system for the better ordering of world affairs could possibly originate in Inn? Or is it rather that the Baha'i principles,  when oniy casually examined, are regarded as too utterly idealistic — the dream of some wouldbe new Messiah? 

 Whatever the explanation may be, the Baha'i principles seem to me to be worthy of the most earnest and sympathetic consideration. 

 It is a trite but true saying that Truth is a diamond of many facets, and light should be given free scope for clear shining no matter from what direction it may emanate. Even the Christian religion had its origin in Judea. 

 So noble and so pregnant with practical suggestions for world betterment are the Baha'i teachings that it seems to n-ic the 'World's Press is missing a great opportunity in failing to give them every publicity while at the same time inviting all pertinent and relevant criticism or comment. Would that the world's leaders possessed a knowledge of Bahi'ism in its spiritual and social aspects and seriously set themselves towards bringing  its fundamental points into actual operation. 

 In perusing Baha'i publications, what first struck me most pleasingly was the high spiritual  tone which permeates the writings of all exponents of the Movement. Baha'ism is based in the first place on th~ essential unity of the human race. This is fully in harmony with the declaration of St. Paul to the Athenians: God "made of one every nation of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth." 

 ~ Moreover, every moral and spiritual precept set forth by Prophet or Apostle — those whom the Baha'is refer to as Revealers or Manifestations of the Divine Mind and Will — is clearly of universal a~pli-cation.  Truth has relation to the whole human race, not to any particular section, 'Acts xvii. 26-R. V. 675


<p676>
676              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  class, race, or nationality, and it is an accepted axiom that sound principles of advancement  and uplift are for all mankind. 

 Concerning other leading tenets of the Ba1A'i Movement it is unnecessary that I should enter into any detailed statement in this article. They are set forth with great clarity and beauty in the publications issued on behalf of the Baha'i Cause. Though enunciated and proclaimed by the trinian sage, Baha'u'llah, some seventy years ago, they are entirely fresh and appli5blc to presentday developments, while some of them are still in advance of leading modern thought, and are laid down with a statesmanlike  grasp of affairs that may be regarded  as truly inspired. 

 No lover of humanity can afford to set such teachings aside as mere idealism unworthy of serious consideration or concern. So much can be said without insisting that every claim and statement in the Movement must necessarily be infallibly true. 

 Personally, I was raised in the Christian (Protestant) Faith and as a member and office — bearer for many years in the Church of 

Scotland (Presbyterian)    

 I subscribe to its confessional standards as sufficiently expressive  of my religious beliefs. But this does not mean that my mind is foreclosed to fresh expository thought — quite the contrary. As a journalist, too, I naturally welcome high and constructive thinking — immeasurably beyond my own• powers — from whatever source it may come. To me, therefore, the Baha'i publications have proved of profound interest. 

 In particular I appreciate the fact that it is not a system of priestly orders, with elaborate rites and ceremonies. 

 Yet it recognizes that ttReligion is the greatest instrument for the order of the world and the tranquillity of all existent beings." 

 This emphasis on personal religion is, to my mind, all-important, for without the Holy Spirit operating in the hearts and lives of men all our social and economic plannings will be largely disappointing and vain. 

 Throughout Christendom, apart from denominational differences, it is common grohnd that the ethical teachings of Jesus Christ of Nazareth are incomparably the greatest the world knows. Equally it is common ground that the Founder of Christianity tianity did not set forth any scheme of administration for universal adoption. 

 Very obviously the world was not then at a stage of development fitted for the working of any definite system of social order. 

 But the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have brought many changes — more, indeed, affecting  international relations than in any previous period of recorded history. 

 Baha'is claim that Baha'u'llah was a Prophet for the New Age, inspired to set forth how the Christian truths and the truths at the basis of all other religions can be fitted to administrative processes the universal adoption of which would result in bringing into operation  the long-prayed-for Kingdom of God upon earth. 

 For myself I see no difficulty in accepting the suggestion that as there were great Prophets who pointed forward to the coming of the Divine Teacher to be born in Bethlehem, so, from that turning-point in human history onwards, other great Prophets should arise to proclaim to the world how His infallible truths are to be practically applied and administered for the welfare of mankind. That Baha'u'llah takes a high if not an altogether unique place among such Prophets or Revealers can hardly be denied by anyone familiar with his writings and teachings. 

 And that he arose in IrAn seems to me to have a significance all its own. At any rate, the student of BaM'ism who fails to be impressed by the nobility and sanity of Baha'u'llah's Revelation, safeguarded by successive Guardians of the Cause, must be singularly insensible to the excellencies and values of great constructive thought. 

 In the summer of 1930, I made a tour of various cities of the United States and Canada.  When at Chicago it was my privilege to be shown over the Baha Temple at Wilmette, so far as it had then been constructed.  Not oniy so, but I had the honour of an introduction to Mr. Louis J. Bourgeois, its architect, who showed me his blueprints and drawings and by means of a model of the Temple explained to me the spiritual significance of its design. Never had I seen anything that so captured my interest and imagination. 

 Here, it was evident, was something original in conception, with a wealth of symbolism and beauty far surpassing  anything I had conceived prior to enter

  ing his studio. It afforded me an insight into the unifying principle underlying Ba-h~i'ism  such as I had not previously realised. It was with sincere sorrow that I learned of Mr. Bourgeois' death a month or two later. My visit to his studio and the interview with which he honored me I regard as a veritable red-letter day in my life. 

 We all speak of Brotherhood and Unity and we know that as general sentiments they are admirable. Various organizations and agencies exist for the purpose of giving effect to the spirit of Brotherhood among men and nations; and for all that has been and is being done in this direction we cannot be too grateful. 

 But until scope is afforded for an orderly expansion of real Brotherhood through a system of administration on lines of justice and truth universally applicable, the sentiment must remain very much in the region of the abstract. 

 My plea, therefore, would be for fair and impartial consideration of the 'World Order promulgated through the Baha'i Movement. It will be found worthy of study by the most highly cultured minds in all nations. If it be what it claims to be — a Revelation for this new age — then it may be likened to a lens of crystal purity focussing and manifesting the Light that shines from Zion hill, the Light that is destined eventually to lighten every land.

'ABDU'L-BAHA'S HISTORIC MEETING
                  WITH JANE ADDAMS
                 B~ RUTH J. MOFFETT

  "Oneness of the world of humanity insures the glorification of men. International peace is the assurance of the welfare of all mankind. There are no greater motives and purposes in the human soid." ~Your efforts must be lofty. Exert yourselves with heart and soul so that perchance through your efforts the light of Universal Peace may shine and this darkness of estrangement and enmity may be dispelled among men; that all men may become as one family and consort together in love and kindness; that the East may assist the W7est and the W7est give help to the East, for all are the inhabitants of one plaiset, the people of one original nativity and the flocks of one shepherd." — eAbdu~lBahd IT was on a warm, springlike day, April thirtieth, 

1912, that Hull House     
in Chicago was all astir. 

 For cAbdu~1~BahA, a great and holy Personage from Palestine was expected. This important visit was planned by Jane Addams, C~Mother of Hull House," or ttChi cago's Most Useful Citizen," as the people of Chicago lovingly call her. 

 Seldom has biographer presented two more significant and inspiring world figures, both working earnestly for the Unity of Mankind and the establishment of Universal Peace than tAbdu'1-Ba1~4 the Center of the Covenant of the Baha'i World, and Jane Addams, the President of the Woman's International League for Peace and Freedom: one Who had been chosen as a Divine Exemplar to humanity, and the other reflecting the spirit of service. How fitting that Hull House —  an outstanding example of the application of the great principle of the Oneness of mankind, should be the place of meeting. 

  During a recent interview with Miss Addams, the writer learned that it was in 1844 that the Quaker father of Jane Addams moved to Illinois. A pinecrowned bill is the living memorial of the bagful of seeds planted by him in that memorable year of world history. 

 In 1860 a little girl was born at Cedarville, Illinois, in the shadow of those pines. As a child, she was a shy, conscientious, entious, sensitive, idealistic girl. These qualities developed into high moral courage, the unswerving devotion to duty, and the passion of self-sacrifice for others. These characteristics served to make this frail woman elect to pass her life in an unsavory quarter of th~~ great industrial city, Chicago,  and to spend there, in behalf of the poor, her inheritance, which would have maintained her in comfortable idleness amid the beautiful things that she loved. Here she has ministered to and educated those in dire need and thus worked indefatigably for the establishment of the unity and amity of mankind. 

 As the years unfolded, Jane Addams received her A. B. degree at Rockford College, Rockford, Illinois, in 1881. Then she spent two years in Europe, 18831885, because of imperfect health. 

 In 1888 she studied in Philadelphia, and the next year opened Hull House with the assistance of Miss Ellen Gates Starr, and has ever since been its Head Resident. For three years she served as inspector of streets and alleys on the southwest side of Chicago. She received her LL.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1904 and in 1910 was honored in the same way by Smith College. Later she became president of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections. 

 Yale University granted her its A. M. degree in 1910. In 680

  1912 she became vice-president of the National  Woman's 

Suffrage Association       

 and chairman of the 'Woman's Peace Party. In 1915 she was elected delegate to the first Peace Convention at The Hague, and the same year became the founder-president of the W~omen's International League for Peace and Freedom, and still remains its active president. She was the delegate to the 

Peace Conventions at Zurich

 in 1917, at Vienna, in 1921, and at The Hague in 1922. On January 12, 1923 she started on a six months tour of the world in the interests of world peace. During all these years many books have come from her pen, and she has served on numerous state and national committees having to do with social, philanthropic, industrial and international problems. 

  I — Jul1 House, one of the first American settlements, stands as a dream fulfilled. 

 It was established in 1889, to become a spacious and hospitable home, tolerant in spirit, equipped to care for the pressing physical, mental, social and spiritual needs of a poor, alien, complicated community. 

 About fifty men and women of various races and creeds and backgrounds form the residential staff, mostly college graduates who pledge themselves to remain two years. In addition, one hundred and fifty others come to Hull House each week as teachers, visitors or directors of clubs. 

 About nine thousand persons come to the settlement each week during the winter months, as members of the audiences or classes. 

 Miss Addams explained that the attractions offered  include classroom instruction in English, current topics, typing, arts and crafts, music, drawing, folk dancing and nearly all phases of domestic arts. Public lectures and clubs of many kinds suppiy the needs of men, women and children of all classes, beliefs and shades of color. 

 A circulating library of two thousand volumes stimulates mental interest. 

 A well trained, working boy's band of sixty-two pieces is a source of great joy, as are the many tournaments and contests, enjoyed especially by the little children  of foreign lands. 

 The monthly gymnasium attendance is three thousand, and the fifteen showers are kept in constant use. 

 During the year six thousand paid showers and twelve thousand free showers help to keep up the physical, mental and moral standards. 

 The Italian, Jewish and Greek nationalities seem to predominate in the clubs and classes. 

  In Miss Addarns' high-ceiled living room, the writer asked her, tcwhat has been one of the central ideas of the activities of Hull House?" Her kindly eyes brightened as she said, t~The things which make men alike are finer and better than the things that keep them apart, and these basic likenesses, if they are properly accentuated, easily transcend  the less essential difference of race, language, creed and tradition." After a time she continued with an alert enthusiasm. 

 ccLife at the Settlement discovers above all what has been called the extraordinary pliability of human nature; and it seems impossible  to set any bounds to the moral capabilities which might unfold under ideal civic and educational conditions. 

 In order to obtain these conditions, the Settlement recognizes the need of cooperation, both with the radical and conservative elements. Hull House casts aside none of those things which cultivated man has come to consider reasonable and goodly, but it insists that those belong as well to that great body of people who because of toilsome and underpaid  labor, are unable to procure them for themselves. Added to this is the profound conviction that the common stock of intellectual  enjoyment should not be difficult of access because of the economic position of him who would approach it, that ~those best interests of civilization' upon which depend the finer, freer and nobler aspects of living must be incorporated into our common life and have free mobility through all the elements  of society, if we would have a true, enduring democracy. The educational activities  of a Settlement, as well as its philanthropic, civic and social undertakings, are but differing manifestations of the attempt to socialize true democracy, which is the very existence of Hull House itself. 

 It is thus that peace and unity are established." 

 "Do you think that the people of the world generally are more peaceminded than before the World 'War?" she was asked.

  "Oh, yes. The war startled and shocked them into a realization of the need of peace as never before. Tt has been more discussed and written about and has become the most vital problem before man." 

 "What do you consider the greatest forces of the world today working for peace?" ttThere are three," she replied: "First, psychological; second, political; and third, mechanical.  First, the psychological includes all the books, newspapers, magazine articles and all the addresses and discussions on the subject, but something more than all of these, the interest and overwhelming desire in the heart for peace. 

 Second, the political, even, has become a force for peace. International instruments to take care of the affairs of all the nations of the world must be created before peace can be maintained. These are oniy just beginning, in the League of Nations, the NQorld Court, an International  Code of Law and an International Police Force to enforce the law. Many other international instruments of this nature will be required. Third, nothing can stay the progress of the machine age, the invention, the improved methods of intercommunication and intertransportation. This is also a great force, bringing about better understanding in the world which is the basis of peace. 

 "You ask what I consider to be the greatest  need of the world today?" 

 she continued. ~ would put it in one word, understanding — understanding between individuals, classes, races, nations. Literature, history and mechanics are bringing it about much more rapidly today. 

 Are not nations simply families living together, learning to adjust themselves to each other for the best good for the greatest number?" 

 CCYCS you are right," she said in reply to my question. ~The problems of the world which are caused by wrong mental attitudes are returning to the heart and mind of man and the solution must come through changed mental attitudes." 

  Although having spoken on the same platform with Miss Addams many times and dined as her guest, yet during this interview at Hull House, alone in the spacious living room with her, the writer was more than ever impressed with a fine quality of innate courtesy, a sympathetic sensitiveness, a queenly dignity and greatest of all the keenness of a brilliant intellect expressing a well-balanced and well-ordered mind. 

 When the author asked her if she had met that distinguished Personage of Palestine Whom Great Britain had knighted as one of the greatest advocates and establishers of World Peace and the Unity of Mankind that the world had known, cAbdu~1~Bah6, she replied  with ap emphatic "Yes." In a iow pitched, well modulated voice, she spoke of inviting rAbdu~1~Bah4 to visit Hull House on April 30, 1912, to speak in Bowen Hall, and although the hail seats 750 people, it was far too small to hold the crowds that poured in. In streams the rich and poor, the educated and ignorant, the managers of business and the industrial slaves came. Hull House was all astir. So was Hlalstead Street, that bit of cross-section, seemingly, of all the markets, bazaars, cafes and wayside churches of all the races, nationalities and creeds of the world. 

 Miss Addams herself, acting as chairman, welcomed tAbdu'1-Bah6. and graciously presented  Him to the audience. Dr. Bagdadi. a physician of Chicago, served as His interpreter, having known and loved tAbdu'1-Bah~  years before in the Holy Land. 

 To attempt to describe CAbd~1Bh~ is like trying to paint the lily. As he stood before the sea of hungry upturned faces, His magnetic personality, His radiance, His penetrating potency, the power of His inspiration,  the very purity of His life, and the great understanding compassionate love, made an impression upon His listeners that they can never forget. 

 Because in 1912 racial prejudice and hatred were very intense and because of the outstanding historical work that Miss Addams had achieved, CAbdu~1~Bahi spoke of the races being like many varieties of flowers in one garden, all adding to the fragrance and beauty of the garden. He spoke of the benefit to be derived by all humanity when universal peace and racial amity have spread over the earth. 

 This depends upon the spirit and intelligence of man. The basis for the establishment of world peace and the amity of man cannot


<p683>
tABDU~LBAHA~S HISTORIC MEETING WITH JANE ADDAMS  683 be based upon color, but only upon noble qualities. 

 'With an almost overwhelming power, cAbdu~1~Bah~ declared, "Th standard  can be no other than the divine virtues which are revealed in him. Therefore, every man imbued with divine qualites, who reflects  heavenly moralities and perfections, who is the expression of ideal and praiseworthy attributes, is verily in the image and likeness of God a divine station which is not sacrificed by the mere accident of color." 

  Abdu'l-Baha at the close of the meeting in Hull House went out into the dingy crowded street, mingled with the little children  and the underprivileged poor, arid gave to them freely from a bagful of coins, with many kindly words of encouragement, sympathy, love and hope, which brightened the eyes, strengthened the courage and uplifted the faith and hope of all who met Him. 

 CAbdu~1~Bah~ expressed his pleasure at meeting Miss Jane Addarns because she was serving mankind. 

 According to His own words, He was chosen by His Father, Baha'u'llah  (the Glory of God) to be the Servant of humanity, and because Miss Addarns has devoted her life unreservedly to others she certainly reflects the beautiful light of servitude.  One of the bounties of the Baha'i Revelation is that women of heavenly capacities can never more be hindered by the ancient stupid form of male supremacy, but may rise to help in the establishment of the New World Order, and of peace and good will to all mankind. 

  As the writer said farewell to Miss Addarns, who was leaving on an extended trip for her health, she presented her with an autographed copy of her photograph and her book, CCTWCntY Years at Hull House," and spoke again of being deeply impressed with tAbdu'1-Bahi and with the beauty and spirit emanating from the Baha'i Temple. She expressed the hope that more people would feel the great need and rise, today to help bring amity permanently to the world. 

 Gazing at the very building in which took place the historic meeting of cAbdu~1~ Bah~ and Jane Addams, and in which tAbdu'1-Bahi had so perfectly voiced the note of the Oneness of all Mankind, and left His spirit like a benediction hovering over all, one saw people of all races streaming  in and out of Hull House, honoring the founder before her departure. With a deeper consciousness of realization, one recognized the fulfillment of those priceless words of cAbdu~1~Ba1~i: cLToday the most important purpose of the Kingdom of God is the promulgation of the cause of Universal Peace and the principle of the Oneness of the 'World of Humanity. NVhosoever rises in the accomplishment of this preeminent service, the confirmation of the Holy Spirit will descend upon him."

THE SOUL OF ICELAND — 
               A BAUKI        
               SAGA           
                              
                  B~ MARTHA L. ROOT

  "Maiden with veil of snow, Why dost thou haunt me so, Longing thy song to know Valiant and sweet." 
                           
O ICELAND, fair Arctic     

 Isle, it is your soul saga that attracts the Baha'i believers of the five continents today; of all the sagas — those ancient, wonderful tales of these North lands sung and told and later written — what will be chanted in the new Baha'i sagas down the centuries now that the Icelandic  people have heard Baha'u'llah's great Message for the first time in their newspapers, over their radios, from their public libraries and through lectures in the one short month from July 12 to August 8, 1935, in Reykjavik their capital! The people of Iceland are ready for this universal Message. 

 Some peace workers in other Scandinavian countries said to the writer of this article. "Why do you go to Iceland with these Baha'i peace principles? 

 The Icelanders are the most real lovers of peace in the whole world." Why go to Iceland? Because this country of high latitudes morally as well as geographically deserves to know the Truth of this New Day of God. They are courageous; they possess the Viking spirit and are wide awake; never have they been so wrapped in superstitions as many other peo-pies. 

 Iceland is unique in that it never had a primitive or savage race. Its first colonists were nobles and chieftains of Norway who came in the ninth century to colonize Ice —  land because they were dissatisfied with conditions  at home. 

 The Icelandic language which is practically unchanged since these first settlers came, is the original of all the Norse tongues. It has been kept so pure that its people can read today the sagas of the twelfth century. Almost a thousand years ago, Nj ill Bergth6rshvoll of South Iceland said of Christianity when it was announced to his countrymen, ttlt seems to me the new Faith must be better, and that he is fortunate  who possesses it. If the men who preach it come to Iceland, I shall assist them according to my ability." Olaf Tryggvason of Norway had sent some Christian missionaries to Iceland. During the year 999, just a few years later, two converts, 

Gizur 'White and Hjalti    

 Skeggvason, went over to Norway to hear more of the Teachings; when they returned they succeeded in introducing a resolution at the Aithing (the Open Air Parliament) and it was carried, that the new religion should be adopted in iceland. 

 One may with profit to the whole of humanity tell the Icelanders about these Baha'i Teachings because today they are great travelers, as well as long ago when in 986 A.D. they fared forth and discovered Greenland, and this led to one of their number,  an IceLander, Lief, son of Erik, the Red, in 1000 A.D., discovering ccVi ElI d" as he called it, namely ~~Wine1and," but it was America. As Iceland (long before 1492 Columbus went to Iceland where he heard about "Vinland") gave us America, is it not oniy a joy but a sacred duty that American Baha'is should carry home to the t~mother-1and" 

Iceland, the Glad Tidings  
of the Baha'i Revelation? 

 The people of this most Northern civilized  state high in the Arctic waters are optimists.  They must take so many chances with the weather on land and sea that they have developed strong character, exceeding kindness to one another and hospitality that comes straight from the heart. One wellknown man wrote in a Reykjavik newspaper 684


<p685>
THE SOUL OF ICELAND               685

  the day of the writer's last lecture on c(Bahi~u~11~h~s 

Teachings of Immortality": 

  our guest will give her last lecture here tonight, I do not know what the Teachings of the Prophet of Inn are on life after death, but every one who carries in his heart the hope of eternal life will wish to hear this significant address. Also, if people would go in great numbers it would make her memory of Iceland more intimate, and that is the kind of hospitality we should like once, ttWe have a love for Ir~in; what is this spiritual Teaching from tr~n?" 

     The Broadcasting Station   

 of Iceland — and it is subsidized by the owners of the radio sets — on July 15, and later on July 23, sent over the air for the first time two talks about the Baha'i Cause: one an air interview and the other a book-review of "Baha'u'llah and the New Era"; besides they gave other items of Baha'i news. These all came in the News Hour in the early evening, just at the Newspapers and Book containing the First Mention of the Baha'i Movement in Icelandic Language. 

  to give to every one who visits Iceland." The hail was crowded. Icelanders always come halfway to welcome new truth. Their spirit, like youth, is ready to seek, to know, to accept, to promote. 

 Iceland has the distinction of being the first state in the world to announce to all nations and peoples her neutrality. She definitely states she will not take part in any war whatsoever. 

 The state that has the courage to do this is composed of men and women who have capacity to appreciate the the principles of the Baha'i peace Teachings. 

 It is interesting, too, the Icelanders said at time when at least fifty thousand people all over Iceland listen in. If the farmers are working late in the fields in this summer weather in July, they always send some one from the family into the house to listen to the news, and come back to report it to the others. 

 The ctMorgunb1a~i&~ in Reykjavik, on July 14, 1935, printed the first article ever published in Icelandic language about the Baha'i Teachings. 

 The editor had said two days before, tCI~11 read this book and these pamphlets and then I'll write." 

 All the editors as well as the radio director had


<p686>
686             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  received copies of 'tBaha'u'lUh and the New Era" from the visitor, for ttJohanna,~~ a Baha'i of Copenhagen, and friends in the United States had sent her copies to be given during this visit. 

     The ccNfia Dagb1a~iC'      

 had a long interview written by the editor, Mr. Sigfus Haldorsson, on July 17, and later on July 28, was a second article, ctI~QThat is the Baha'i Movement?" 

 This was so excellent that a thousand reprints were made of this one article in order to give them out to people, because there was as yet no Ba1A'i booklet in Icelandic. 

 A school principal in Reykjavik, one who for years had studied Theosophy deeply, was introduced to the writer next day on the street and he said, ~tOh, so you are a Baha'i! I read the article tWhat 

Is The Baha'i Movement?'   

 in the cNfja Dagb1a~i~' yesterday  and said to my wife, tA lodge will grow up in Reykjavik around such a Teaching as this.' 

 He invited us to come with him to his home to coffee, as is the delightful custom in Iceland. We went, and after a long conversation  about the Baha'i Teachings, just as we were about to go, he asked, "Tell me, do you believe in dreams?" 

 The writer replied,  "yes," that Baha'u'llah said there may be many mysteries and wisdoms in dreams; even there are occasions where it may happen  that one witnesses outwardly in the world of time exactly the thing he had seen in his dream. 

 CtWWell~~ said the host, CClast night I dreamed that a bird came into this room, and resting on the sofa sang such a beautiful melody. I was so happy. This morning I said to myself, CnW1~o will come?' Then I met you in the street, you come with your friend Holmfridur to our house and you have taken the seat on the sofa where the bird came and sang the melody!" He was one of the great souis of 

Iceland.                   

 Other newspapers that used excellent articles were the CCVisir~~ July 18, 1935, and "A1thydub1a~i&' July 25, 1935. The newspapers and likewise the broadcasts gave information where Baha'i books could be obtained and that any public library wishing the Danish volume (cBahi~u~11ih and the New Era" could obtain one free of charge. Books were placed in the Reykjavik public libraries. Although Iceland is so small, only 26,000 people in Reykjavik and 126,000 population in all — for it must be remembered that nine-tenths of Iceland is uninhabitable,  being a vast desert of rugged lava poured forth in ages past from its many volcanoes and intersected with mountains and great glaciers — yet the number of books drawn out from the public libraries is extraordinary.  From the People's Library in Reykjavik they lend out ten thousand books a month. Packages containing forty books each are lent regularly to the fishing trawlers when the men go out to sea to remain months at a time. 

 I heard that even at Hiisavik, a little herring station up on the coast there is a splendid library started by a farmer, Benidik J6nsson, now over eighty years old. He has gathered together nearly five thousand voi-umes.  A few are English books; in the autumn the farmers come there from remote places to buy their provisions for the winter and they call at the library to draw out a large collection of books which they read during the long winter evenings; for in this land of the summer midnight-sun the winters  are very long, dark and cold. Often during the winter one reads aloud in the home while the others work at various kinds of handcrafts. These farmers return the books when they come to the station again in the spring to sell their sheep's wool. There is a thirst for knowledge in Iceland and a love of reading is innate; there are no illiterates in Iceland. 

 Esperanto is making progress here. The writer lectured in Esperanto before the 

Es-perantists  of Reykjavik

 and was presented with the volume, CCAlphj6damil og M4lley-sur"  (International 

Language and Bad Languages)

 where on page 84 is the first mention ever printed in Icelandic literature of the words "Baha'i Movement." 

 It mentions  ttLa Nova Tago," Esperanto magazine devoted to the Baha'i Movement. 

 The book is written by an Icelandic author, Th6r-burger  Th6rdarson, and was published in Reykjavik, 1933, by the Culture Foundation of the State. 

 The writer had corresponded with Mr. Th6rdarson and last year sent him Baha'i books in Esperanto, he sent back the word, CCTell her we are waiting for her in Iceland."


<p687>
THE SOUL OF ICELAND               687

  Another brilliant group in Iceland are the Theosophists, They have one of the most beautiful Theosophical buildings in Europe. 'When the first Baha'i lecture was given in the Chamber of Commerce soon after arrival,  the majority of those present were Theosophists, The Secretary of the 

Theosophical  Society     

 of Iceland who was present invited the Baha'i speaker to meet a few friends in her home the next week, and later she graciously acted as interpreter when the Theosophists extended the courtesy of their hall for the lecture: "Bh"'11'h' Teachings of Immortality." The Theosophists  had just had a large Summer School of Theosophy in Reykjavik, Some of them said they had seen copies of CtThe Baha'i Magazine" and thus had learned something about the Teachings. 

 And here is where a charming bit of saga should be sung: ccMi11y,~~ a devoted American  Baha'i, had come with her husband in 1924, on one of those cruises now becoming so popular, where the passengers stop in Reykjavik for a few hours. There in the wonderful Einar J6nsson Museum, an Ice —  landic lady, tcHo1mfridur,~~ had explained the sculptures and the two became friends; Milly later asked the ship's guide for the full name and address of Holmfridur, From the home — land Milly wrote to this new friend in Iceland and regularly has sent "The Baha'i Magazine" from that time to the present. 

 The next year, 1925, Holrnfridur came to the United States for a few months to attend an International Congress and study at Columbia University. Milly entertained her friend for nine days at her summer home in Massachusetts, where the guest read the Baha literature several mornings and said she was delighted to see what Abdu'l-Baha had written about Iceland and Greenland, and bow even the climate would change should the fire of the love of God be ignited there. A decade passed by and a few times each year these two exchanged notes of greeting. 

 Then in July, 1935, "Martha," another Baha'i, also from the United States, is just ready to start from Copenhagen to Iceland when she is surprised to receive a letter from Milly recounting the Iceland incident and enclosing Holrnfridur's name and address. Arriving at Hotel Island, in Reykjavik, on July 12, 1935,. and quickiy unpacking her bags in her upper room, Martha sent a note by messenger to Holrnfridur and lo, she comes, Flow smiling she is and yet how quiet! 

 She possesses poise and peace, a fine mind, spirituality, and a pleasing sense of humor. It is Holmfridur who has shown "The Baha'i Magazine" in the TheosophicaL circles during the past years here, for she is herself a Theosophist but she is very sympathetic  to the beautiful Baha'i Teachings. It is she who introduced the writer to the thinkers of Iceland and helped daily to make the month so memorable, When the Baha'i saga is sung a century from now, may Holmfridur be praised and may Milly's name be chanted high, for her eleven years of love to her Faith and to her friend prepared a clear path for the Baha'i Cause here in Iceland. 

 One day in Reykjavik, Holmfridur went with the writer to visit the Leper Hospital far out, where Baha'i books were given, some to the nurses some to the patients. Walking back to the city along the shore of the Arctic Ocean where near the town the banks gleamed white with salted codfish drying in the sunshine, suddenly HIolm-fridur said: ~ think it would interest you to know that a leper boy, Christopher P6tursson, first heard of Theosophy in that hospital. He came there a boy of sixteen years and remained until his death at the age of forty-three; he is the one who has translated  most of the Theosophical books into Icelandic." 

 'What great things they do in Iceland! One of the greatest hymn writers of this country, Haligrimur Pjetursson, was a leper too. 

 Mr. Einar J6nsson, the celebrated sculptor of Iceland, whose works are visited every year by art lovers from many lands, has a famous pi&e in his gallery: this sculpture  represents the poet alone, suffering, sitting on his bed; but just above is the spiritual Haligrimur IPjetursson, the glorious religious poet of the Passion psalms, with the crucifix in one hand, the harp in the other leading the long line of Icelanders up and up. 

 One should begin any saga, any article about Iceland with the name of Einar J6nsson, he is the greatest soul in Iceland today. His masterpieces in his museum are


<p688>
688              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  like Ccit~~ of art, giving the glad-tidings  of spirit conquering the physical, the immortal rising up from death. The humblest peasant, as well as the most profound  scholar, all art lovers who walk through the gallery cannot but be cheered, refined, inspired. 

 Just as Raphael could paint the soul, Einar J6nsson can release the spirit out of marble. 

 Whatever his religion is, certainly his spirit is "Baha'i" (light-bearing) He said to me, ccEverything is from the Higher Plane. 

 It is! The artist oniy makes it manifest; I am only a servant. The sculptor takes away the rough envelope which enwraps the spark of God." 

 It may have been only a coincidence, but it is like a confirmation from God that it was in this lofty Einar J6nsson Museum that the Milly-Holmfridur flower of friendship was first planted in Iceland. 

 What saga could ever tell it all! Those days in Reykjavik so full of joy and gladness,  those eager questions! One man who lectures in all parts of Iceland said: "I'd like to translate cSecurity For a Failing World,' this is a book Icelanders would like!" Another said, ttWho is going to translate cBah4~u~1flh and the 

New Era' into Icelandic?   

 It should be published in our language." In a word, the Baha'i Movement was discussed everywhere. 

 tAbd'lBh' in His Tablet to the believers  of the Baha'i Assemblies of the United States and Canada, on April 11, 1916, wrote, ccShow ye an effort, and after this war, spread ye the synopsis of these Teachings in Iceland, Faroc Islands Also, in His Tablet to the believers in the Provinces of the Dominion of Canada, written April 5, 1916, Abdu'l-Baha said: "Perchance, God willing, the Call of the Kingdom may reach the ears of the Eskimos. 

 — Should in Greenland the fire of the love of God be ignited, all the ices of that continent  will be melted and its frigid climate will be changed into a temperate climate —  that is, if the hearts will obtain the heat of the love of God, that country and continent  will become a divine garden and a lordly orchard, and the souis like unto the fruitful trees will obtain the utmost freshness  and delicacy." 

 Winters in Iceland may be dark, but the warm Gulf Stream flowing up from Florida waters winter and summer, is what makes Iceland a livable land. As one Reykjavik doctor expressed it, '~JceLand is centrally heated and the furnace is in the Florida waters." This large island, second in size only to Great Britain in the European isles, is between four or five days' journey by ship from Hull, England, three or four days from Leith, Scotland, via the Iceland Steamship Company line; 1300 miles from Copenhagen  by way of the Danish Steamship Company line; it lies 440 miles cast of Greenland, and 65 0 miles from the West coast of Norway, via the route of the Bergen Steamship Company. All these liners pass by Faroe Islands and Vestman-naeyjar,  Westmann Islands, so they gave an excellent opportunity to the Baha to speak a little about the Baha Cause on these islands which fringe the Arctic 

Circle.                    

 Picturesque Reykjavik — capital of this land of jagged snowcapped mountain peaks, great glaciers, and ice fields, magnificent waterfalls, boiling hot springs, geysers and desolate lava fields, with everywhere that wonderful fascination and nameless charm which is associated with this high altitude —  has a climate of extraordinary clearness and purity; pure by reason of its freedom from the taint of dust — the strong winds keep it clean. The fine and generally dry air tempered  by the glaciers and the sea, and then pervaded all day and nearly all night by vitalizing solar glow is something possible only in a high Arctic land like this. Houses are comfortably heated, the air is full of ozone, one does not feel fatigue, and the salty breezes from the ocean are most bracing. 

 The future will witness many travelers from all lands coming to tctake their cures" and their summer holidays in Iceland; for bodies, minds, souls experience here something different from what they have ever known before. There is a calm too, a repose in the very Icelandic atmosphere,  and the almost celestial colors of sky and clouds, mountains and sea, not to be found anywhere else — all these will bring one back again to Iceland! 

 Maiden with veil of snow, now we thy song do know. It is thy soui we hear, valiant and sweet!

 traf im April, 1913, nicht lange vor seinem Tode, per-sanlich  mit tAbdu'1-BaM in Budapest zusammen und wurde durch diese Begeg-nung so stark beeindruckt, class er sich v6llig vom Geiste des neuen Glaubens angezogen ftihlte. Er schrieb darnach an CAbdu~1~BahA in Erwiderung auf em von Jiesem an ihn gerichtetes Schreiben u.a.:

SOUTH AMERICA

 Journey Taken in the Interest of the Baha'i Cause  

                B~ LOULLE A. MATHEWS

  SOUTH AMERICA can no more be described  as a whole than can the continent of Europe. Its vast area comprises variety in language and custom, while its history stretches back into a dim past, from whose shadow archaeologists have rescued broken fragments that show mummies embalmed after the manner of Egypt, skulls that have been trepanned, geometrical ornaments, vases of classic design as well as delicately wrought profiles in silver and gold. Alas! that no Rosetta Stone has been found to enable us to read the characters on the arches and columns that lie prone on the sites of the ancient temples. 

 Each country of South America has written its own separate history. 

 The West Coast, however, may be said to possess a common denominator — trade, because of the depots of fruit, oil, metal, fertilizers and grain. 

 The Humboldt current, an icy stream of water, flowing up from the Antarctic region encounters the Japan current,  chilling the waters of the Pacific and killing thousands of fish upon which the guano birds feed. Sometimes the shores become lush and tropical wherever the Current has wandered off into deep waters. 

 The most interesting city of the West Coast is Lima in Peru. Here in the year 1538, Pizarro made himself master, not alone of what he surveyed, but, like Midas, of gold and silver. Having captured the last of the Incas, Pizarro promised him his life if he would fill a lofty chamber with gold, but when this request was complied with, Pizarro put him to death with crafty haste. The Conquistador then turned his attention to founding a city that he named for Saint Rose. 

 Lirna today breathes the spirit of Pizarro. 

 From the palace to the Inquisitional Hall his steps may be retraced, and upon reaching the Cathedral one sees him proudly riding a spirited horse, sword in hand. 

 This fine statue is the work of the late Charles Rumsey. Inside the church on the right Pizarro's body has been preserved and is visible through a glass casket, awesome and hideous, but the proud treasure of the city of Lima. 

 As we had journeyed to South America with a definite Baha program, that of forming groups for the study of the Baha Faith, as well as to find individuals of capacity, who could comprehend Bahi'u-'lhh's program for a future civilization, we gathered facts about the countries through which we were to travel. Thus we learned that while outwardly the Spanish conquest maintained, commerce was siowiy drifting into alien hands. Canadians, hardy and thrifty, were here. Americans also, their heads crammed with schemes for accelerating trade. Germans by the thousand, driven from the Fatherland by the great war. Italians out of sympathy with present day government. These pioneers were moulding the environment to suit their needs, while each brought his traditions, his culture. 

 The CtSt Lucia" landed us at Valparaiso  and from there the train carried us to the capital of Chili, Santiago. The city is set in a bowl enclosed on all sides by towering Andes mountains. 

 Each hour of light throws a mantle of color over the mountains and at sunset the shadows turn from pink to blue and taper into a soft purple that diffuses its imperial color over the whole city. 

 The streets of the capital are narrow and shabby; here and there a richly ornamented building bespeaks a spurt of ambition. 

 My first definite request to present the 692


<p693>
SOUTH AMERICA                  693

  Baha'i Cause was at the Y. W. C. A. The proposal met with an instant response. 

 The staff made all arrangements and when the afternoon arrived the hail was crowded with notables — the heads of the Sweet Memorial hospital and clinic; the directors of the Valparaiso Y. M. C. A., the leaders of the literary societies as well as President of the college and ministers of various denominations. 

 Mr. Mathews opened by reading a page from the 

Baha'i Scriptures. When   

 he finished, the chairman asked him to read it again. 

 This request became the keynote of Era" and "The Goal of the New World Order" in 

Spanish and English.      

 At length the time came when we bade farewell to our new-fouhd friends, happy in the thought that in the capital of Chili there would be a group studying the Cause. Study would augment capacity and in time an understanding of the principles of the New Civilization would draw these students to become part of the great program of Baha'u'llah. 

 In 1921, CAbd 'lBh' wrote a Tablet to chili and sent it to Martha Root. 

 It is of Class for the Study of the tqdn, Sprecklesville, Maui, Hawaii, February, 1934. 

  the occasion, lifting it beyond the ordinary meeting and when the talk ccwidening Our Horizons was finished, questions were asked from every part of the audience. 

 It was already dark when we left the building; the whole afternoon Lid been filled with heavenly enthusiasm, so much so that we could scarcely credit the fact that we, the bearers of a new Message, had been so warmly received in this distant land. 

 Immediate results followed, for both the head and secretary of the Societd de Femina became students of the Baha'i Cause. 

 This little literary circle of thirty students studied literature in both Spanish and English and it was therefore arranged that they should read ttBah~'u'1hh and the New the utmost importance and passages are herein quoted. 

 CCYOU see how the world is attacking one another, how the countries are dyed with human blood. 

 Heads have become like grain in a grinding mill. 

 Prosperous  countries have been ruined, cities devastated, villages demolished. 

 Fathers have lost their sons, sons their fathers, mothers have wept blood for the ioss of their children. 

 The source of all this unhappiness is racial prejudice, national prejudice, religious prejudice and political prejudice. 

 The source of these prejudices is ancient imitation. So long as blind imitation lasts, the human world will be in ruins and in peril.


<p694>
694             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  CCNOW in such a glorious age, when the realities have appeared and secrets of being have been discovered; the morning of truth bath shone, the world has been illuminated, is it permissible to wage these terrible wars, wars that throw the human world into ruins? 
No, not by the Lord!       
     "From the horizon of Ifrin 

His Holiness Baha'u'llah    

 has shone like a sun upon the world and He has declared that the world was dark and that this darkness would continue  with horrible results. From the prison of tAkki He clearly addressed the Emperor of Germany saying that there will come a great war and that Berlin will weep and lament. 

 When the Sulvin of Turkey wronged Baha'u'llah, He wrote him from the barracks of Akka that Constantinople would fall a victim to a great revolution, one extending even to the women and children  so that they would (also) lament, with great cries. In brief, He addressed all the Kings and Presidents of Republics what would happen and that which He wrote has come to pass. 

 The Supreme Pen has written how to prevent war and His words have been scattered all over the world. First among these councils is the independent search after truth, because imitation limits man. The second teaching is of the oneness of the world of humanity — all are the creation of a Creator; God, the kind Shep —  herd shows kindness to all, He does not differentiate. 

 The Clement Lord sees no differences between 

His Creatures. All are His 

 servants and all receive his Generosity. The third teaching is that religion is a strong fortress, but it must be the cause of love. 

 If it causes hatred and enmity, it is unnecessary. 

 For Religion is like a cure; if the cure causes illness than it is better to dispense with it. Religious, racial, national and political prejudices are the destroyers of the world. These are the causes of bloodshed, prejudice is the ruin of the world of humanity. 

 As long as they last, frightful wars will recur. 

 The cure for these ills is universal peace. 

 "For the world to have universal peace a great world court must be set up by all the governments and nations. The problems of all nations and governments must be turned over to this court and whatever this court decides must be accepted and followed. 

 If a government or nation disobey,  We whole world must rise to oppose that government or nation. 

 Now it is clear that these teachings are the life of the world and its true spirit. As you are servants of the human world you must strive with heart and soui until humanity is rescued from darkness, from prejudice and from the world of nature. Strive to reach the light of the divine world. Praise be to God that you are informed of these teachings.  Today without Baha'u'llah's instructions the world will have no rest. Of itself the darkness will not disperse, these serious maladies will not be cured, instead conditions will become worse and more difficult day by day. 

 The Balkans will not be tranquillized, they will seek means to inflame  the fires of war again. New public movements will use their powers to achieve their own selfish ends. Therefore with bright hearts, divine souL, celestial strength and heavenly will, strive to be to the world of humanity God's bounty and the cause of rest and tranquillity to humanity." 

(Signed, 'Abdu'l-Baha     

 tAbbis) There are two ways of reaching the Argentine from Chili; the first is over the Andes, the route Martha Root had taken; the other skirting Chili and Patagonia. We determined upon the Southern route where no Baha'i had yet been. From the south, winter was already enveloping the whole Antarctic region, sending icy winds northward over Patagonia. We decided, however, to risk these hazards and go to the Argentine  via the Chilean 

Lakes.                     

 Orsono, the starting point for this region, lies a day and night journey from Santiago. In the town of Orsono there was but one motor available for reaching Lake Lian-quihue  — an old and rickety Buick; in this disqualified vehicle we began our journey, swaying over dirt roads furrowed by continuous  rains. Here and there the ruts gave way to beds of lava, over which the machine would roll shaking and groaning. 

 After four and a half weary hours we descried the welcome lights of Ensenada. It nestles beside a sheet of still water surrounded by great trees from whose pointed leaves heavy

SOUTH AMERICA                  695

  drops fell rhythmically. 

 The tiny cabin that received us was as narrow as a box, its single window nailed against fresh air. 

 Its furnishings  consisted of a straw mattress laid on boards covered by turkey red comforters that did duty for sheets, blankets and pillows.  No palace, however, could have seemed more luxurious! Our inquisitional ride was soon forgotten in the company of the proprietor who was both cultured and charming, and expanded mightily on hearing Mr. 

Mathews' fluent German.    

 In this remote land occurred a great spiritual experience. 

 One of those meetings of the spirit that make social amenities pale by comparison. 

 It happened that a German couple had come from Puerto Varas, 

Chili. Madame de Burmuihi  

 spoke English. In whispers in the corner of the office we talked of the New World Order; as I unfolded the Divine Plan she seemed to read it with me as from an open book. 

 Each statement of mine was rounded out and completed by this clearsighted woman. As I explained the simple form of our Administration and the station of the Guardian of the Cause, she repeated my words to her husband: "Listen, Gustave, we have a Guardian — one who holds the world together in this day — one who is preparing humanity for a new civilization." 

 Very thoughtfully he turned the idea over in his mind and then replied in a deep voice: "Yes, yes, I can understand that. It is as it should be — somewhere a spiritual leader must be making the plan that will guide us out of the wilderness and chaos of the present into a new and better path." Madame de Burmuihi explained that they belonged to a large group of Germans who met and studied under the name of "Liberal Thought Society." But no more literature from the society was permitted in Germany, so as Winter approached they were without material for study. The Baha'i Revelation formed the link in the chain and they embraced  it eagerly and whole-heatedly. They felt sure that the study group would accept it, as they did. 

 The steamers connecting one island with another sail oniy three times a week. These inland mariners pay small heed to schedules and departing passengers find it wiser to gather on the wharf ahead of time, so we hurried hither accompanied by the German couple now deep in the study of the Cause. We skirted a swift running river, now and then crossing it at shallow points and taking occasional dips under water falls that seemed to occasion no surprise. 

 Arriving well in advance we prepared to wait when suddenly  the boat decided to start and began churning white foam in long streaks through the green water. Our friends pressed to the edge of the sand, their arms outstretched, calling God's blessing on our Baha'i endeavors. 

 Far out on the water we could hear their voices. The afternoon was bright and still, trees crowded down to the water's edge; snow smooth as frosting rounded the tops of the mountains. 

 A thousand rivulets poured snow water into the lake. 

 The atmosphere was laden with a kind of thrilling, expectant beauty. Nature occupied in seasonal rounds seemed indifferent to man's behavior. Crossing the Lake of All Saints was like witnessing a fraction of creation. 
    A week we travelled thus.  

 Sometimes mounting over the crests of rocky promontories; sometimes encircling volcanoes where we were lost in steam. 

 We made steep descents on foot and once we were ferried by a crude handmade craft. Physically the journey was hard, spiritually it was revivifying,  for everywhere were listeners eager to hear news of the Great Event. It was, indeed, a pilgrimage of the spirit and reflected a degree of capacity in the Germans of that section of South America that is unforgettable. 

 At length we reached Lake Nahuel Huapi at the far end of which lies Baha'u'llah, the town that terminates the lake trip when coming from Chili. The last journey by water is the longest, and that morning dawned cold and windy. The tiny steamer was tossed and tumbled by the waves. Spray was continually flying overhead, while on the benches it was impossible to avoid a wetting. All through the four and a half hours' journey our eyes strained towards our destination as the wind rose and moaned, grew angry, dropped into silence only to repeat its attack on a higher scale. The pilot hugged the shore and when at last the


<p696>
696              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  headland, behind which the steamer was to moor, hove in view a shout of joyous relief rose simultaneously from every throat. 

 Baha'u'llah has one train a week. It arrives from Buenos Aires every rriday and returns on Sunday. 

 The villagers living along the shore of Nahuel Huapi make of the train s departure a fiesta. 

 Women wearing Spanish shawls, pound the pavement with high heels; peasants carry bright-colored dusters with which to shine the inscriptions on the sides of the train. Passengers embarking for the capital, forty-two hours distant, are regarded  with awe. 

 Cameras click, fruit is vended, tunes hummed, as the crowd gape at the miracle of machinery that has ended an isolation, inviolate for a hundred years. At five sharp the whistle blows, the admiring throng stand back. The engine shakes itself free of lake and mountain; it turns and twists until rugged outlines fade and heavy forests disappear, and then it settles down for a long trek across the plains of the Argentine. 

 Mile after mile of swaying pampas passes the train window, mysterious, uniform, as though the world had become suddenly a planed floor of exact measurements. 

 Through this moving sea of grass stalk cattle flank high. Up or down, east or west, there is pampas; the mind recedes from all forms of variety and settles back into the subtle peace of complete monotony. 

 The Argentine is rich enough and big enough to feed the whole world with beef; its markets could supply grain and wooi as well. Prices have fallen in the general economic depression and growers fasten their hope of recouping diminished fortunes on war, war in Europe or, in fact, anywhere. Already they are tinning beef, weaving blankets and rolling bandages so that at the first cry of battle these goods can be set afloat and at the Argentine's own prices. Naturally peace is unpopular, kindness and brotherhood are looked upon as antiquated principles. 

 Old animosities live, though each nationality within the country deplores the fact and wish it otherwise. 

 The churches watch each other in jealous alarm, fearful of the increase in number among opposing denominations. 

 The Argentine and the English leave the whole ethical question alone. The Americans make a weak show of getting together by drinking tea under the entwined flags of all nations, but without the genius of Baha'u'llah who has given us a purpose for meeting — a definite plan that is practical as well as spiritual — these gestures of unity lead nowhere.  Into this land so uniform in appearance, so separate in consciousness, will come the Supreme Remedy, namely the Baha'i message. 

 It will gather up the alien threads and weave them into a pattern of universal design; it will set in motion a spark with which mankind will recapture belief in the power of love and suffering. 

 Self-interest will be merged into larger issues. 

 The secrets of Being hidden in the stream of life itself, will emerge and man will experience the condition described by Baha'u'llah in the Seven Valleys. 

 (CA servant always draws near unto me with prayers, until I become his ear wherewith he heareth. 

 For in that case the Owner of the house becomes manifest  in his own house (the heart) and the pillars of the house are all illuminated and radiative through His light. The action and effect of the light is from the Giver of Light; this is why all move through Him and arise by His Desire." 

 Buenos Aires greeted us with a downpour of cold rain. The stirring events of the Chilean trip, however, buoyed our spirits above temperature and filled our hearts with strong hope. 

 It was a strange coincidence that we should arrive on the same day as Krishna Murti, for he had come to Auckland, New Zealand on the same date as we, of the previous year. Again our arrival in Sidney, Australia had been simultaneous; now he landed by steamer from Brazil as our train pulled into Buenos Aires. Naturally the three branches of the Theosophical Society combined on an intensive campaign for him, punctuated by flurries of publicity. 

 Martha Root had been received by them with the utmost cordiality, but I knew I could expect nothing for the present. I had, however, brought letters to other important organizations as well as to diplomats and high officials. Affable conversations, cakes and tea, followed upon the presentation of these letters but when I spoke of the mission that


<p697>
SOUTH AMERICA                  697

  had drawn us hither, invisible barriers descended  barring further advances into the subject. I was encircled by absentminded smiles and polite retreats. 

 Even Peace, that redoubtable and highly honored topic, fell to earth without an echo. 

 The rain continued. The test of faith is more faith. When difficulties surround one it is best to draw back from the material world into the circle of Divine Protection. The personal will with its desires must be folded up and laid away. A realization of the power within the Cause must be made a reality, so that the knowledge of Bahi'u-'lUh's  spirit shining upon the earth filling it with unending rejoicings, may manifest itself in the individual. One must grasp the fact that subjectively the whole world is aware whenever a messenger comes to earth. 

 Success, or failure — neither have anything to do with truth. Under these reflections one may wait for guidance, but once convinced of a course of action, go forward unhesitatingly and leave the results to the guiding spirit that animates and sustains  the Cause of God. tAbdu'1-BaM says: CCKnOW that the blessings of the Kingdom of Abhi are not dependent upon the capacity  and worthiness of anyone; the blessings themselves are the worthiness. As the action  itself, when it reaches the thing acted upon, makes the thing the action, so the blessings themselves become identical with worthiness." 

 Opportunity came in the form of an invitation to address the Dramatic Society on the modern drama! I accepted. The afternoon came and dressed in my best I stepped upon my initial platform. The talk received widespread publicity and the daily papers carried the entire talk. 

 This brought the editor of ttThe Standard" to interview us. I confided to him my dilemma. He was so intrigued that he decided to study the Cause with me and investigate its truth for himself. 

 After an intensive course of reading he was carried beyond journalistic impulses and there began to appear in the columns of his paper references to the word Baha'i, its meaning, its origin and finally a two column article on the history of the movement from its inception. 

 The bridge of sighs was crossed. It became came known that a new and constructive movement had I?een brought to Buenos Aires and I was asked to address first the Contemporary  Club and later the American, The Amateur, and the Business Clubs as well as smaller groups. I was elated when approached  about addressing the Girls' High School, but the proposal laid before the board of directors, did not prosper and the invitation was withdrawn. 

 Giving a talk at the Spanish Club I had to employ an interpreter. This was a veritable  ordeal and I remembered how many times tAbdu'1 — Baha has passed through the ordeal of having His words redistributed by an alien tongue. 

 From a variety of public talks there emerged certain personalities that made an indelible impression. 

 First in order of time was Miss Beer, a German from 

Africa's Gold Coast. Tragedies

 had rained down upon her ever since the World War. In an agony of spirit she had battered at the door of ancient theology, only to find herself shut out by dogmatic controversies. 

 From the first, she fell in iovc with the Baha'i principles; she amassed a wealth of quotations from the 'Writings and studied by night as well as by day. After our third iesson she read a paper on the Baha'i Movement before the German Literary Circle. As the inner commotion  of soul subsided, she expressed a happiness that is impossible to describe. 

 A giant of undaunted courage was Sefiora Barrill. Her husband had been a pioneer in Argentine finance and from his accumulated fortune had built a veritable palace of medieval splendor. 

 Then, suddenly, sh~ was left alone. It was at this period of her life that an awakening of soui occurred. All at once there flooded her being an inner consciousness that a new Message had come to earth, a Message that would bind all religions together. She closed the palace and started forth in search of that which her heart foretold. 

 But everywhere she went she encountered creeds, old and new. Saddened  by failure she journeyed homeward. 

 I gave a talk at the Y. W. C. A. on the union of all races, religions and creeds. Though understanding no English she came to hear it, with her niece as interpreter. All during the talk I could see that she was

  in a state of agitation; she clasped and unclasped her hands continuously. 

 As soon as I finished she beckoned me. (CAll over the world I have been seeking the treasure that you have now placed in my hands this afternoon.  tThe New World Order' that you have explained, has been ringing in my heart for many a long day." Often when we sat together before the fire she would cry out, t~Let us go spread the good news — let us tramp the world over." And though well over seventy, as we left she was preparing to depart on a world crusade. 

 Another wonderful friendship was formed with a distinguished Argentine family that we had met on the train from Baha'u'llah. There was a widow, her daughters and a niece. They came to hear me speak and presently we found ourselves being entertained  by the most hospitable of people. We saw gardens copies from the palaces of Europe, where roses grew as high as young fruit trees, beds of lotus in bloom, white and tranquil beside marble poois. Everywhere  were rare tropical plants gathered from the far off islands of the Pacific. One day, while Sefiorita Lavarello and I were driving, she remarked, CCYOU remind me of someone I met in Geneva — a woman all spirit." Naturally I asked her name. ttLd Blomfield," she replied, — "Like you she is a Baha'i. It is strange how much this religion attracts me, but I know it is not for me, for should I approach it ever so secretly, the family would know and every member of the clan would arise to save me from Hell that they would see yawning to receive me; — you have no idea of the power of Spanish traditions — the Rock of Gibraltar is a weak defense by comparison — I would be immediately  surrounded by an ecclesiastical conference that would go on forever and ever." "Well," I replied, laughing, "if the picture you have painted is even half true, I think you better come to the United States where no one will be interested in your beliefs, nor take heed of the ideas you harbor beneath your charming curls." So we planned that she should come in the Autumn and I pray that this free soui may come under the Baha training that will develop, without curtailing her lovely spirit. 

 One morning the daily papers announced that Mr. Julius Lay had been appointed Minister to Uruguay. This was happy news for me, since they were not oniy my friends but Mrs. Lay had studied the Cause with me during a visit to a munial friend. 

 She was a woman of purpose and generosity and one that could be counted upon to uphold the Cause and to use her influence in its behalf. 

 The visit to Buenos Aires that in the beginning had been fraught with dark difficulty,  terminated in great enthusiasm for the Baha'i Principles. Alas, that a rigid code prevented joining my pupils together. 

 Nevertheless, as I stood on the deck of the steamer that was carrying us to Brazil, I felt that group consciousness would be the natural consequence of Baha'i study and would come about as a result of it. I cannot believe that the door first opened by Martha Root and a second time during our voyage will ever be shut again. 

  A journey of four and a half days by water brought us to Santos, Brazil. 

 This low-lying unimportant looking island represents the largest output of coffee in South America. 

 We made a special trip to S5o Paulo. One is astonished to see a skyscraper  of twenty-five stories, the largest concrete building in the world. In fact, the size and proportion of the buildings is a constant surprise. For example, in the Hotel Esplanada of STh Paulo the seating capacity of the dining — room is five hundred. Entering this enormous banquet hail you behold an elaborate display of tropical fruits on illuminated cakes of ice; this frosty feast makes a welcome contrast to the burning sun that is forever shining behind the curtained  windows. 

 We drove to the Butantan snake farms, now world famous, where is distilled the serum that has lowered the death rate from snake bites from 90 to 40 per cent and they work here night and day to fight a menace that constitutes one of the major difficulties in homesteading this vast country. 

 Twelve hours by rail brought us to Rio de Janeiro; the train winds and slides down, down to the sea. 

 In Rio, Leonora Holsapple joined us. She had come following 

Martha


<p699>
SOUTH AMERICA                  699

  Root's notable visit to 

South America. Settling    

 in Baha, (which in Spanish means bay) she had set herself the task of mastering Spanish and Portuguese, while earning her living in a city directly over the equator. Encouraged by our Guardian, she translated and published CtBh~~~11~h and the New Era" and other volumes, thus making an outstanding contribution for all time to the Baha'i Cause. 

 Through the influence of this true Baha'i friend, we were able to form a class without delay. 

 These people were sufli-ciently evolved to draw together for study and to meet often. A second class soon followed the first, through important Americans to whom we had brought letters. The members of this class enabled me to place IBahA'i books in the circulating libraries. 

 I found oniy one Baha'i book in Rio; that was a copy of Mr. Holley's ttBah4'i, the Spirit of the Age." 

 It was gratifying to learn from the librarian that it had been widely read. 

 We were invited to spend an evening with the Siif is to address their members. 

 As far as we could learn, they were not connected with the Siif is of I r~n. 

 The movement had been brought from India to London and its leaders, Mr. and Mrs. Cecil Best, were English. The pamphlets describing  the belief seemed subjective in character  though broad and humanitarian in design. 

 5Afi Lodge was built on the top of a mountain, literally above the clouds and standing on the roof garden the fleecy white clouds floated below while above was the starry sky. On an opposite mountain carved from rock stands a gigantic figure of Christ with arms outstretched in an attitude of blessing. 

 Far below the sea was visible, breaking into white foam that shimmered and glistened under the thirty thousand lights that encircle the shore. It was a sight of beauty for which no adjectives seemed adequate. 

 I spoke on the prophecies fulfilled by the Baha'i Religion and gave a short outline of the BTh, Baha'u'llah and tAbdu'1-BaM. Their reception of the talk impressed us all. It was evident that there existed a strong spiritual tie between us and some day this will be cemented. 

 From that moment they did all in their power to help us spread the Baha'i Message and surrounded us with every kindness. 

    Through Miss Holsapple's   

 influence I spoke at the Educational League. This important committee controls the education of Brazil as well as the reading matter that goes to schools and libraries. Religion may not be spoken from their platform but the breadth of the Cause gave ample opportunity  to outline education from its spiritual standpoint. 

 I also addressed the Y. W. C. A. that throughout the journey had treated our mission with so much cordiality. 

 We held a Baha picnic, on the shores of an inland lake. We talked of tAbdu'1-Bahi's presence at Evergreen 

Cabin in West Englewood.   

 We discussed the happy 19-day  feasts that are held throughout the world, their origin and purpose; the day was sweet and memorable. 

 In retrospect it is impossible to number the individuals that crossed our path during this voyage of five months. Constantly we were meeting strangers and constantly telling them of the purpose of our visit. By land and by sea, over thousands of miles, the Cause was heralded and its dynamic news spread. 

 South America needs workers to carry on the Divine Plan. It is not enough that a teacher crosses the continent every few years. 

 It is not enough that one woman gives her life for the spread of the Cause. If these two Republics could unfurl the banner of Baha'u'llah's Principles together, they might lead the world into a new era of peace and happiness. 

 The Guardian is deeply concerned with the spiritualizing of South America. Whosoever arises to labor in this field will be rewarded and every traveler will be upheld by the Holy Spirit. No sacrifice should be too great to a true believer. 

 For the purpose of life in this day is to extend God's glory through the Message of Baha'u'llah to the far-flung corners of the earth.

  rrVealy, we have ordained unto every land a destiny, unto every hour a fate; unto every utterance a time, unto every circumstance a word. Consider the case of Greece! Verily we made it the center of wisdom for a long period. Bitt when the time of its end caine, its throne became veiled, its tongue dumb, its lamp extinct, and its standard reversed. 

 Thus We give and take away. Verily thy Lord is the Taker, the Giver, the Mighty, the Potent." 

            Baha'u'llah.              

  SWEDEN is the oldest of the three Scandinavian kingdoms. ~~When the Germanic  groups went south in great folk migrations to mingle their blood with the Mediterranean races," says Hanna Astrup Larsen, Editor of the American-Scandinavian Review, ttthe Scandinavians stayed behind and in their isolation developed their own peculiar heritage." 

 Ancient tradition has etched in the consciousness of her leaders the spirit of public —  mindedness and in the consciousness of her people faith in the Crown. And from the period of the W~asa Kings, in the sixteenth century, when King Gustavus Adoiphus organized state and Crown leadership, embodying  the definite paternalistic attitude of the state toward the peopie and the recognition of education as an important factor in the life of society, the moral influence of the Crown was enhanced. 

 Today Sweden is a constitutional monarchy,  with a distinctly democratic representation and a parliamentary government. The left wing is always a strong factor in the Riksdag, the socialist party having now and then risen to a commanding position. Nevertheless, Royal Committees and advisers  appointed by the Crown are un hampered in the execution of decisions reached by the Riksdag. 

 In His Tablet "The Glad   
Tidings," Baha'u'llah     

 makes mention of the ideal government — a fusion of aristocracy and democracy through the medium of consultation:  (cAithough a republican form of government," He says, ~Cprofirs all the people of the world, yet the majesty of kingship is one of the signs of God. We do not wish that the countries of the world should be deprived thereof. If statesmen combine the two into one form, their reward  will be great before God." 

 The tradition of the nobility, having its impetus under King Gustavus Adoiphus, has also been of importance. Indeed the public-mindedness of the nobility, reaching its crest in the seventeenth century, and which later fell into neglect and abuse, created a tradition of noblesse oblige which still obtains, although nowadays the nobility as a separate group exercises no influence. 

 But the national development of Sweden is unique in the traditions of her peasantry. Says Miss Larsen, "The national impulse of Scandinavian countries turned not only backward to the past but also inward to the study of the peasants, who were thought to have carried on the traditions of the fathers most unbroken." 

 The capacity of the Swede for organization and legislation is innate but this sense of law and order—   through which far-flung changes have been achieved without revolution — grew out of the early political training and responsibility imposed upon the peasantry, for the landowning peasantry of Sweden has exercised political rights since early in the fifteenth century. 

 This practice had its inception in the period when the Wasa Kings, founders of the principles of Swedish statesmanship, introduced the severe practice of forcing 701


<p702>
702              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the people to participate in decisions of national scope — war, peace, taxation and educational  reform. 

 Characteristic of the precision  and conscientiousness of the Swede, no one was permitted to remain unconcerned. 

 Hardship and peril beset the traveler in those days and the representative of a district would, before setting forth on his journey, put his affairs in order and partake of the last communion! Consequently, representation in the Riksdag was a responsibility hardly to be sought after with enthusiasm! 

 Property owners of each district were required to sign the decision of the Riksdag which their delegate brought back with him. In later times Swedish peasants have had their seats in the King's cabinet and no movement or reform can pass the Riksdag without their influence. 

 This stabilizing influence of the peasantry has served to strengthen the prestige of the Crown and the custom of conferring titles on persons of the lower classes distinguished for public service, has extended and fertilized the nobility.  "The Scandinavians," writes H. G. Leach, editor of The Forum and an outstanding authority on Scandinavia in the United States, in his book CAngevin Britain and Scandinavia,' " are freemen. 

 They understand organized democracy. The Norseman belonged to those people who, unlike the destroying Tartar, possess the strength and latent power of growth that enable them to adopt a civilization without decaying under it. Instead they bettered what they found, advancing rapidly from students to teachers     The ancient Scandinavian  rivalled the modern Japanese in taking on a new material civilization in a day." 

 National and social coalescence are further enhanced by racial and religious homogeneity, for with the exception of approximately  one and a half percent the population is Swedish in origin and belongs to the Swedish state church. 

 The peasantry of Sweden has not only contributed to the past, but to the present progress of Swedish society. In contradistinction to the experience of a people growing  out of serfdom, they are conversant with the trend of national affairs, the importance of the arts and sciences in the development of civilization and have a keen appreciation of cooperative activities, of finance and commerce. 

 Freedom from the consciousness growing out of the practice of serfdom has created a peasantry with aristocratic traditions and has been a powerful factor in obviating that sharp cleavage between classes which became accentuated under autocratic rule. 

 The part played by the peasantry in the development of Sweden is of unique interest to students of Baha'i principles, for recognition  of the fundamental position of the agricultural unit is unequivocally set forth in the writings of Baha'u'llah and amplified by CAbd~1Bh~ again and again in his unique station as Interpreter of the Revelation: "In reality," he says, "so far great injustice has befallen the common people. 

 The community needs financier, farmer, merchant and laborer, just as an army must be composed of commander, officers and pri vates    but justness of opportunity for all.     First and foremost is the principle that to all the members of the body politic shall be given the greatest achievements of the world of humanity. Each one shall have the utmost welfare and wellbeing. To solve this problem we must begin with the farmer; there will we lay a foundation for system and order, because the peasant class and the agricultural class exceed other classes in the importance of their service. 

 It is important to limit riches as it is also of importance to limit poverty. 

 A financier with colossal wealth should not exist whilst near him is a poor man in dire necessity. 

 When we see poverty allowed to reach a condition of starvation it is a sure sign that somewhere we shall find tyranny. The rich must give of their abundance, they must soften their hearts and cultivate a compassionate intelligence." 

 Religion has initiated in Sweden three distinct phases of national development: The initial phase of exotic influence began in the period of the Vikings, 8001000; the second phase might be said to constitute the Medieval  Catholic Church when the intellectual life fused with that of the continent of Europe, and the third phase — the Reforma

  tion — froin which issued national independence and entrance upon a new political and economic experience. It marked the inception  of interest in elementary education. Today school and church are classified under one department head with representation in the King's Cabinet. 

 The Christian Faith was originally planted in Sweden by the Crusaders, Ansgarius and Birgitta, early in the ninth century and while the Scandinavian may adopt a material civilization with facility, the fact that Christianity was not officially inaugurated as a state religion till the eleventh century demonstrates the depth of religious susceptibility of the Norseman. The old "pagan" faith was not subverted till after the conquest of England by the Danish Kings, Sweyn and Canute. 

     Significantly, Ansgarius   

 foresaw a future spiritual glory for Sweden. "A great light," he said, "will emanate from the North." That was early in the ninth century. 

 Early in the eighteenth century, nine centuries later, Sweden gave birth to a spiritual genius, Emmanuel Swedenborg. His advent, the spiritual life he released, bad the effect of refreshing spring showers. 

 He magnified anew the belief iii immortality, picturing graphically in his interpretative scriptural writings the continuity of life — a factor of incalculable potency in relieving the egocentric maladies that attack mankind. 

 In the journey of the soui, depicted with transcendental beauty by Baha'u'llah in ccSeve1~ Valleys," He writes, "0 Son, if thou canst overcome sleep thou wilt also be able to conquer death and if thou canst prevent thy waking from sleep wilt thou be able to prevent thy rising after death." 

 And the scientific exposition of tAbdu'1.-BaM  inculcates a clear knowledge of this teaching. "The immortality of the soui," he says, C(j~ mentioned in the Holy Books. It is the fundamental basis of divine religions.  Total annihilation is an impossibility. 

 At most, composition is ever subject to decomposition or disintegration.  This is the law of creation in its endless forms and infinite variety. As existence  can never become nonexistence there is no death for man. The rational proof of this is that the atoms of the material terial elements are transferable from one form of existence to another, from one degree  and kingdom to another, lower or higher. 

 For example, an atom of the soil of dust of earth may traverse the kingdoms from mineral to man by successive incorporations  into the bodies of the organisms of those kingdoms. Throughout these degrees  it retains its atomic existence and is never annihilated nor relegated to nonexistence. 

 Death, therefore, is applicable to a change or transference from one degree or condition to another. The purpose is this: — that the everlasting bestowal of God vouchsafed to man is never subject to corruption.  The conception of annihilation is a factor in human degradation, a cause of human debasement and lowliness, a source of human fear and abjection. 

 It has been conducive to the dispersion and weakening of human thought, whereas the realization of existence and continuity has upraised man to sublimity of ideals, established the foundations of human progress and stimulated the development of heavenly virtues.  Spiritual existence is absolute immortality, completeness and unchangeable being." 

 The philosophical and spiritual teachings of Emmanuel Swedenborg penetrated the 'West. In a Tablet addressed to an American Baha'i, E. E. Wrestling-Brewster, tAbdu'1-Bah~  gave to Emmanuel Swedenborg the significance of minor prophet. ttAs soon as a bird is fledged," he said in that Tablet, Ctfr cannot keep itself on the ground. 

 When the season of spring dawns, a new and wonderful motion and rejuvenation is witnessed  in all the existing things; the mountains  and meadows are revived; the trees find freshness and delicacy and are clothed with radiant and bright leaves, blossoms and fruit. In reality Emmanuel was the forerunner of the second coming of His Holiness the Christ and the herald of the path to the Kingdom. I hope that thou wilt arise to perform all that which 

His Highness Emmanuel      
hail predicted.            

  In recent times a movement to recapture the spirit released by Swedenborg was set in motion under the leadership of the late Archbishop Nathan S6derblom of Upsala,


<p704>
704             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Sweden. The ancient church of Ansgarius, situated on the island of Visneg 0 outside of Stockholm was renovated and in 1930, an exalted spiritual ceremony took place in that church. There congregated the Ruling House of Sweden, Archbishops representing most of the nations of Europe, besides eminent men and women. The late Archbishop Sbderblorn presiding called to mind the sacrifice of those early Crusaders in promoting a new Faith — his theme taken from the twenty-fourth Psalm: "Lift up your head, 0 ye gates and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is this King of Glory! 

The Lord of Hosts, He      
is the King of Glory!"     

 Undoubtedly the mission of Emmanuel Swedenborg was greater than his most devoted  adherents imagined, for he was indeed an announcer of the approach of that cycle of reality envisioned by poets in all ages and promised by Celestial Messengers in succeeding cycles, the Era of Universal Peace and Enlightenment, initiated by the Bib in 1844, brought into the full range of its magnificence and power by Baha'u'llah, 18631892, and carried by His Son, cAbdu~1 Bah4 in person to the Western continents. 

 Throughout his arduous career, the late Archbishop Saderbiorn devoted his far-reaching  influence to the propagation of spiritual and humanitarian ideals. 

 He investigated  and endorsed the Baha'i teachings, finding in them the fulfillment of his loftiest aspirations. 

 In his later years he worked to establish those principles. 

 His efforts have borne fruit. In her recent travels throughout Northern Europe, the international  Baha'i teacher, Mrs. Louise Erickson, was impressed with a new spirit permeating her native land, Sweden. tcwherever I spoke, wherever I met thinking people," she said, CC]j felt the presence of a new spirit. Frequently I heard the remark ccOur beloved Archbishop Saderbiom was an ardent advocate of those very principles which you are disseminating." 

 And Mrs. Erickson added, "The cultured people of Sweden are putting into practice the Principles revealed by Baha'u'llah, although unaware of their source. The movements for peace in Sweden are strong." 

 When rhe newspapers of Sweden announced  that Mrs. Louise Erickson, 

Swedish-American  Baha'i   

 teacher had — in an audience with the Crown Prince — presented His Royal Highness with literature on the Baha'i Faith, it was the signal for widespread  interest and as it offered a panacea for the social, religious, national and political ills which have beset mankind, it made a strong appeal to leaders of peace movements. 

 To eager inquirers Mrs. Erickson lost no time in declaring the Principles of Baha'u'llah to be the creative source for the solution and healing of these problems. She spoke of this new Faith as (Ca religion not new but revitalized and freed from dogirias and rituals. To leaders of 

Peace organizations  Mrs. 

 Erickson said simply, "Peace cannot  be accomplished with a plan. You must have principles. tAbdu'1-Bahi said that Peace will come — it is the spirit of the age!" 

 CCToday~~ tAbdu'1-BaM said, ccthere is no greater glory for man than that of service in the Cause of the Most Great Peace. 

 The powers of the earth cannot withstand the privileges and bestowaL which God has ordained for this great and glorious century. It is a need and exigency of the time. Man can withstand anything except that which is divinely intended and indicated for the age and its requirements 

     At present Universal       

 Peace is a matter of great importance,  but unity of conscience is essential so that the foundations of this matter may become secure. 

 Mrs. Erickson found that distinguished public servant of Sweden, Carl Lindhagen, a strong advocate of peace. 

 In a remarkable  interview granted her by the former Mayor of Stockholm, Mrs. Erickson received inestimable support. 

 ccWh he conceded the interview," she said, ttl~e invited me to come and see his home. tCome out to my house,' he said, ~ want you to see my home.' 

 ccThe house is built on a high rock. Viewed as one approaches from below it appears like a great white swan resting against the rock. Mr. Lindhagen met me at the door and invited me to the veranda to meet Mrs. Lindhagen and there to view the scenery. 

 From the veranda the panorama is mountains, valleys and water. You gaze out over Lake Mirza, the most historic spot

  in Sweden. It completely surrounds the little town of Mariefred, on a tiny island, and there is Gripsholm Castle built by the great 

King Gustav Vasa.          

 "Mr. Lindhagen intended that this should be an inspiration to me. It was. The home and the environment were to me the key to the personality of my host. CWC are too busy with humanitarian work and our writing,' Mrs. Lindhagen told me, cto enjoy our home.' 

 ttln the library we had coffee and srnbr-brad  — coffee is the rare treat in Sweden —  and the conversation settled on the paramount question — Peace. I outlined the principles of Baha'u'llah, dwelling especially on the oneness of mankind, the abolition of all prejudices, harmony between science and religion, the equality of privileges for and women, universal education and a universal  language. 

 My host listened attentively and answered, ~ have always thought along these lines. But if they build on the principle of a Universal Language that alone will establish Peace. 

 It is a medium for universal understanding. I believe in the Principle, that is why I work for it.' Esperanto is becoming increasingly popular in 

Sweden.                    

 must speak Esperanto very well," I ventured, recalling public addresses made by 

Mr. Lindhagen in Stockholm 

 at the Esperanto Convention in 1934, and at Danzig, where he had planted a tree at a public ceremony given by the Esperantists there. 

 Gathering from all corners of the globe, representatives of this organization brought with them the soil in which the tree was planted. 

 "No," he answered, ccj studied that speech in Esperanto especially for the Convention." 

 CCH you seen the Crown Prince?" he asked. 

 "No," I told him, ~ have no acquaintance  who can open the way to an audience." 

 He arose, excused himself with exquisite courtesy and left the room. ttj have talked with the Crown Prince on the telephone," he announced when he came back, "and he will receive you next Tuesday at ten in the morning. 

 cdt was my wish to leave with Mr. Lind —  hagen a copy of tBahi'u'llAh and the New Era.' He requested me to autograph it and seating me at his own desk he said, "'Write my name and yours under it. On my vaca-don  I shall study it." CCThis instructive and refreshing interview  — which seemed to pass so quickly —  had consumed several hours and was the means of my audience with the Crown Prince." 

 ttBend your minds and wills," Baha'u'llah admonished over sixty years ago, cc~ the education of the peoples and kindreds of the earth, that haply the dissensions that divide it may, through the power of the Most Great Name, be blotted out from its face and all mankind becpme the upholders of one Order, and the inhabitants of one City. 

 Ye dwell in one world and have been created through the operation of one Will." 

 In a beautiful home an hour's ride outside  of Stockholm, Mrs. Erickson found Harald Thulander, blind Esperantist and publisher of Braille books. This remarkable man has translated into Esperanto and published in Braille a considerable number of Baha'i pamphlets. 

 Nowadays the ancient democratic spirit of Sweden is embodied in His Royal Highness, Gustav Adolph, the beloved 

Crown Prince. "The Crown   

 Prince," Mrs. Erickson related, ~ required to participate in social activities ranging anywhere from the dedication of universities, public parks, museums and schools to cattle conventions. 

 He in —  stils new ideas and practical methods as well as the pattern of noble ideals and beauty. I believe he is surely one of the busiest men in all the world. To have met him personally  is an experience I shall cherish always. That meeting opened every single door and was the greatest means for the spreading of the universal teachings of 

Baha'u'llah."               

 cnn Copenhagen, I telephoned Mrs. Ruth Bryan Owen, American Ambassador to Denmark.  I had met her distinguished father, 'William Jennings Bryan, after his pilgrimage to tAkk~ while CAbd~1Bh~ was still in prison there. She arranged for me an opportunity to present His Majesty, King of Denmark, with a copy of tBahi'u'11&h and the New Era' in Danish." 

 Up from the age of the Vikings, to

  Ansgarius and Birgitta, through the Medieval Ages to the Reformation and Swedenborg  — destined as the herald of the approach of the Promised Age — the influence perpetuating the onward march of Sweden has been, without doubt, superbly spiritual. This preparation, combined with a natural religious yearning, is indeed significant of a spiritual destiny. 

 That spirit it must have been that sustained her and stayed precipita-don  into the World War and in the present maelstrom of conflicting and unpredictable events in which the nations of Europe are becoming more and more submerged. 

 Is it not possible that Sweden, reinforced with new spiritual values — the dynamic principles and teachings of Baha'u'llah — will not be caught in the disintegrating forces of war and aggression; will keep aloof and stand ready to lead the way out of the perplexities  and chaos of that old world order?

RUSSIKS CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION
                 TO THE BAHA FAITH
                  B~ MARTHA L. RooT

  MRS. ISABEL GRINEVSKAYA, a Russian  poet in Leningrad, gave a great impetus to the Baha'i Movement and to world art in her three celebrated writings, the two dramas, "Bab" and ~ and a narrative called 'tA Journey in the Countries of the Sun." The last named is an account of her visit to CAbd 'lBh' in 1911 when He was in Ramleh, Egypt. While the last is in prose it has verses introduced so that we might almost say that the three form a trilogy in poetic form presenting the new universal religion of the oneness of mankind proclaimed by those three heavenly personages,  the Bab the Forerunner, Baha'u'llah the Revealer of the Word and tAbd'lBh' the Center of the Covenant of the 

Baha Faith.              

 From the point of view of art the dramas rank high. Russian critics affirm that these works have proclaimed their author a poet of the first order. One of her countrymen, Mr. Wesselirzky, President of the Foreign Press Association of London, said that he read the drama "Bab" on a railway train when he was returning to England from Russia in August, 1905. His own words were: was at once attracted by the rare combination of philosophical thought with a great power of expression, beauty, imagery, and harmony of verse. I keenly felt the delight of reading a new, great poem and discovering a new first-rate poet. 

 I should have felt so on broad, general grounds from whatever country the poet came! However, my joy was intensified by the fact that the poem had been written in my own language  and that the author was a countrywoman  of mine." 

 This article purports to give a little history of these works, for 

'Abdu'l-Baha Himself     
praised these dramas.     

 (I do not know that He saw the narrative.) 

 When He held the manuscript of the drama ~ in His hands, He blessed it and prophesied to the author that these two dramas would be played in TihAn! 

 The drama crBAb~~ was published in May, 1903, and was played in one of the principal theatres in St. Petersburg in January, 1904. It was this drama that first brought to Count Leo Tolstoy a knowledge of the Baha'i teachings. 

 He read the book and at once wrote to Mrs. Grinevskaya his appreciation of her great drama and his sympathy with the Baha'i Movement; the letter was printed in the Russian press and the poet has his letter in her possession now. 

  I have before me as I write a clipping from the "Herold" of January, 1904: ccThe play Bab appeared in May of last year, 1903, the most inconvenient time for the appearance  of a book. Nevertheless the pens of the critics began to move in the journals and magazines in order to compose hymn-songs of praise to the author. 

 Moreover an enlightened Persian society sent her an inspired letter of thanks; and above all, Mrs. Isabel Grinevsky had the spiritual satisfaction that among those who eulogized her drama was the lion of contemporary 

Russian literature, Leo   

 Tolstoy. The impression was such that it made us think that amidst the statists representing the Persian throngs were real Persians; it seemed as if the scene exhaled the perfume of the roses of ShiMz!" 

 Mr. Wesselitsky, whom I mentioned earlier in this story, gave a lecture in London in 1907 about this drama and his speech was afterwards published in pamphlets in English and French.' I quote two para-'Pamphlets  in French and English, London, 1907, at the Press of "Chronide," 29 Besborough Street, London, S. W. 707

  graphs: "Amidst the sorrows of disastrous war and those dreadful inner troubles, that book tBib' was my oniy happy impression, and it remains since a permanent source of joy and comfort as a manifest proof of the vitality of Russia and its creative genius. 

 "The romantic side of this drama, too, is quite original. The plot is not based on adultery as in French drama and not on seduction as in tFaust,' but on renouncement and self-sacrifice. The romantic side of the B&b is closely allied with the metaphysical-ethical side. The drama has so much of the latter that every act may seem to be a sermon and the drama itself a suite of sermons. 

 Yet all that preaching is relieved by genuine enthusiasm, eloquence of the heart and real passion. The conflict in the soul of the hero is not between passion and reason, but between two passions — human love and love divine — the latter being stronger and mote ardent than the former. It is that manifestation of the power of the higher aims in the heart of man which is the chief feature of this book and the secret of its irresistible charm." 

 Celebrating the decade of the first performance of CCBib~~ in January, 1914, Mrs. Grinevskaya gave a great conference on the drama in one of the most beautiful concert halls of Leningrad. The CrSt 

Petersburg Informations    

 Paper" gives the event a long review praising the author and her reading of selections from the poem and her address. One paragraph particularly I remember: CCAS a characteristic of the frame of mind of the poetess during the creation of her poem, the following words of her own may serve as an illustration: tA well known professor told me that the name of my poem, does not sound well to the cars of Russians. 

 I answered that the names of the people who preached the ideals of love, paying for those ideals with their lives, must sound well to all those who have ears to hear. All noble ideals are so few in these days that it would be worth while to renew the performance of ~tB~b" in order to awaken the remembrance  of these ideals. We, the people of the 'West, rise too late, we do not know the East where the sun shines!' 

 The play was presented again in the Folk Theater in Leningrad in April, 1917, after the Russian Revolution. 
People came even from      

Moscow and Turkist~n       

 to see it. Diplomats from foreign countries were in the audience; the ambassador from China was one. A second edition of the drama had been published in 1916, and these books were sold at the entrance of the theater; many spectators sat with the open books in their hands during this performance. It is a long drama in five acts, equal in the number of verses to "Don Carlos" of Sculler and ttCromwell" of Victor Hugo. 

 When I wrote asking Mrs. Grinevskaya about these dramas she sent me several letters. 

 I should state that she has written many works along different lines of thought and lectured on many subjects in Russia, and had often spoken in conferences on these two dramas, ttB'b" and t~Bah4'u'11&h." She was a member of the former Philosophic Society of the University, an active member of the former Oriental Society, and is a member of the present Bibliological Society and several literary societies and unions. 

 She said that before she wrote her poem ~tBTh," the Russian public generally had not heard much about the Baha'i Movement. 

 She herself knew about it oniy from reading. The critics thought she had traveled much in 15n, she was so well informed about the life there, but as a matter of fact she had not been in tr~n. 

 She had heard that some Baha'i believers from kin had been driven out of their land into Turkey and India, and that some had come to Turkistkn and were residing in the cities of T6shkand, Ishqabad and Mary and in the city of Biku in the Caucasus. 

 ~cSti11 I thought," she says, Ccthese believers in the Bib now called Baha'is had mingled with other nations, and perhaps had ceased to exist as a religious entity. The description of Proftssor Edward G. Browne seemed to me a fairy tale. How astonished I was when, after my drama Bab' made its appearance in 1903, I received one day a letter with the following address: ~To the Author of the book reBdb)) Mrs. Isabel Grinevskaya in St. Petersburg.' Neither street nor number of the house was marked, yet thanks to the careful postal authorities, that letter, though unregistered, reached inc safely."

  Both the handwriting and signature proved unknown but she relates: "That letter was from tAli-Akbar Mamedhanly from BAku who wrote that he was a believer  in the Bab, that he had read in the point them out? It was like a star falling from heaven at my feet! As if I had found a precious stone where I had not expected to find one.

  and philosophical ideas from the stage; it was accustomed to lighter plays, not a theme about God, of religion, especially about the conception of a new religion or rather, I would say religion renewed!" 

 The Baha'i from B~ku politely replied to Mrs. Grinevskaya's letter as follows: "The impression which I received in reading your drama was such that I could not see any mistakes of any kind, even though I read it many times. 

 We read it in the Ba1i~'i Assembly (meeting) and the believers send you sincerest thanks. 

 They feel sure that the literary world will soon unite in a general solemnizing of your creative powers. 

 She said that he also wrote beautifully about the Baha'i life in Caucasus, stating among other points: "W~e live here cherishing the tenets for which our grandfathers, fathers and brothers shed their blood maintaining  the chief principles: pardon, patience and iove to mankind." 

 Mrs. Grinevskaya said that these letters were written in Russian  and showed that the Baha'is were very enlightened in literature and science. 

 She also added: cdt was such a joy to me to find that there are in the world people so congenial  to me in feeling and in vision. I loved with my soui those spiritual people who, just like the people in my drama, were holding those principles of pardon, patience and love to all mankind, holding them not as a dead dogma but as a living truth!" 

  Now I shall speak of the tragedy-poem ~     Mrs. Grinevskaya wrote me how she received the inspiration to write it. She said: "Among the many letters which I received from unknown people, all writing me about my play, tB~b,' was one from a gentleman who to my astonishment had a profound knowledge not oniy of the Bib but also of Baha'u'llah. 

 Like the Bib, until 1903, Baha'u'llah was generally unknown even among the cultured classes, professors sometimes asking me who my hero was. Even one (Czarist) politician had once asked me, ~What is Baha'u'llah' Not who, mind you, but what! So I was all the more impressed to hear from my Russian provincial correspondent the name of Baha'u'llah.  He said in his note: ~I was fasci nated by the poem Bab like a youth though I am not a youth in years. 

 I have passed two faculties of the university and have in my library all the available works which appear in the literature of the world.' 

 C(JJ counselled me," Mrs. Grinevsky says, "to compose a tragedy about the life of Baha'u'llah. 

 I myself had thought of it but had been so occupied I had never attempted it; now I determined to undertake this big work. 

 I always remember with gratitude the memory of this Russian gentleman who was not a Baha'i but a man of great heart. He passed on before my work was published, and I never met him. His name was Nicolas Zazuline; he, as I knew, was president of the nobility in Kishinef and the author of several philosophical treatises." 

 She continues: "When my work was finished and notices about it appeared in the press, a number of people who had assisted at the representations of my poem ~B~b,' and had heard my conferences about that poem which I gave many times, asked me to prepare a lecture about my new composition. 

 The first address about it was given in our summer capital Siestroretzk and afterwards I also lectured in the capital itself at the Society of Oratorical Arts' Hall, in the year 1910." 

 Mrs. Grinevskaya explained that when her Baha'i correspondent of B6.ku, Mirza. cAli Akbar Mamedhanly, read in the newspapers that the work was finished (be had known from her that it was being written), he asked to have a copy sent to him. She mailed to him several excerpts from the poem. A few weeks later she was amazed to receive a telegram from him saying: CC CAbdu~1~BaM permits us to visit Him in Egypt." 

 tAbdu'1-Bah& was at that time making a short stay in Egypt. 

  She writes in her letter to mc: ttThat had been my secret, my innermost desire, to see with my own eyes those people whom I had described, who, as my correspondent said, Clove all mankind.' 

 I had thought it absolutely impossible, and yet, unexpectedly, wonderfully, it had come to pass that I could go to see even the greatest of those people! 

 I started from Russia with my manuscript of the poem tBah~'u'1hh' in December, 1910, my aim being to see the


<p711>
RUSSIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO BAHA'I FAITH 711

  surroundings of my dreams, of my fancy, about which my former respectful correspondent  and present fellow-traveler in that journey to Egypt had spoken — to see Abdu'l-Baha" Seven years had passed between the appearance of the drama ccBAb~~ and the concluding  of the tragedy cCBhi~~114h~~ fob. lowed by this memorable jburney. Mrs. Grinevskaya spent two weeks in IRamleh, Egypt, as the guest of ~Abdu'1 Baha After she returned to Russia she had several letters or Tablets from Him. In one of these He speaks of an article which He had just received about her poem tcBah67u~116t.~~ From the Tablet (or letter) addressed to Madame Grinevskaya and signed by cAbdu~1~ Bah6., 

 I quote: "The article which was published in the Saint Petersburg Journal about thy recent book (Baha'u'llah) was in the utmost eloquence and fluency. It was an indication of thy praiseworthy services. The publication of such articles is very useful. They are conducive to the promotion of the divine Gall. Praise be to God that thou art assisted in the service of the world of humanity and art spreading the summons of the Kingdom of God. 

 Day and night thou must praise God that thou art assisted to perform such a great service. 

 Rest thou assured that that which is the utmost desire2 of thy heart shall come to pass concerning this matter. 

 CCThis seed which thou has sowed shall grow. 

 If the means are not available at present, unquestionably they will become realized. I pray in thy behalf that thou mayest become confirmed in the uninterrupted  service of the Kingdom of God." 

 The article which Abdu'l-Baha mentions in His Tablet had been published in the French newspaper "Journal de Saint-Peters-bourg" January, 1912. The headline was ~    I quote paragraphs from this review: UBahi~~l~11Th means the Glory 

     2 In a footnote Mrs. Grinevskaya

 adds that her utmost desire which she had expressed in Rarnleh had been that her poems might be translated into European languages. 

 The poem "B&b" has been translated into German and French, but the poem "Baha'u'llah is still untranslated. 

 of God — such is the title of the new tragedy with which Mrs. Isabel Grinevskaya has enriched  Russian dramatic literature. 

 We must praise without restriction a work whose high, dramatic significance is combined  with admirable form. The author of the drama Bab,' that work of such strong thought, has never attained such a powerful conception as this poem. 

 "The mind of the reader, attracted by a rhythm of an unspeakably harmonious poetry, rises imperceptibly to summits where the most grave problems are discussed, problems over which thoughtful humanity bends with fear and despair, helpless to solve them. The characters are analyzed with great psychological insight. 

 ccBahA2u~11~h, the central figure, is depicted  with the clearness and power of an antique high-relief. 

 The complexity of that elect-nature is presented with the authority and truth of the great masters of the classical theater. 

 What a lofty lesson, what eloquence sursum corda in that life of pure bounty, of selflessness in that wide desire to spread peace! 

 CCHOW not to be moved, fascinated by the nobility of this Apostolic character? 

 "As in the cBib~ the events touch the great religious movement which roused the country of Persia in the middle of the last century. The historical part is exact. Mrs. Grinevskaya did not limit herself to the studies of documents, the great quantity of which we can hardly imagine; she knows the country very well. Her knowledge gives to the characters an intensive life and a warm coloring. 

 "The origin of a faith analyzed with the help of true science is carried forward with great art beginning with the first thought which toves the heart of the Apostle, who loves mankind as He loves His family and His own country. 

 c~T1~e author gives a vision, a revelation of all that is hidden of moving, precious depths in that supreme struggle. 

 The liberating  pain, the majesty of effort, the active bounty — all these elements of that struggle remain ordinarily unattainable for the crowd which cannot fathom under their austere dogmas, one of the beautiful forms of human unity.


<p712>
712             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  "The love, the deep necessity which lives in each human heart passes throughout the tragedy as an undercurrent, the fountainhead  of which, never drying, remains hidden to the exterior world. 

 "That beautiful and bold work points a return to the school of majesty and aesthetic morality, the aspiration to the eternal truth, which are the indelible character of permanent  works. We foretell for this book a most merited success. 

 Humanity, be it to its credit, is tired of the histories of the impure which spoil the taste and soil the mind. It cannot but receive with enthusia-asm  a work of which the most civilized countries of Europe will be proud." 

  Mrs. Grinevskaya, returning from Ramleli in January, 1911, gave interviews to the press at Odessa, the Russian port of the Black Sea, and as soon as she reached home she began her book, (CA Journey to the Countries of the Sun," which is an account of her visit to tAbdu'1-Bah~. 

 This was in —  terrupted because in the summer of 1912 she was called to Paris by the French translator  of "BTh," 

Madame Halperin. When      

 she came again to Leningrad she immediately began the publication of the drama ttBahi-so  that it was not until 1914 that she completed the manuscript of (CA Journey to the Countries of the Sun." It is interesting  to note that when she completed it, three Ifrinians, Assad-Ullah Namdor of Moscow,  tAli 

Akbar Kamalof of Tishkand  

 and an old trdnian Baha'i friend whom she had met at Port Said, came to call upon her and she read to them many parts from the "Journey," the central figure of which is tAbdu'1-Bahi. This book of 550 pages has not yet been published because at this time the world war commenced; neither has it yet been translated into other languages. 

 May this great Russian poet, Mrs. Isabel Grinevskaya, who has made such a cultural contribution to literature and to the Baha'i Movement some day see all her works tans-lated  into European languages! The English reading world eagerly awaits them, I know, for many inquiries come from the United States asking where it is possible to get these books in Russian, in French, or in German!

A BAHA'I INCIDENT FROM
                   THE NETHERLANDS
               By LOUISE DRAKE WRIGHT

  liiE broad sympathetic outlook, brilliant mentality and executive capacities of Madam W. Wijnaendts Francken-Dyserinck of The Hague, the Netherlands, entitle her to be known as one of Europe's leading figures in the 'Woman's Movement and various  national and international affairs. 
    She is a member of the     

International Council      

 of 'Women, established in 1888, and for years has lectured, written and freely spent her energies in helping to forward the progressive ideals for which her country is noted. 

 She is a skilful organizer, and established throughout her native land the Girl Scout Movement, as well as the Soroptornist Club for business women, similar to the men's Rotary Club. 

 In the summer of 1933, during the Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago, she represented her country at the International Woman's Congress assembled there, and spoke to vast audiences. 

 At the request of Shoghi Effendi, the next winter I returned to the Netherlands for the third time and endeavored again to make known Baha'u'llah's priceless gifts to mankind. 

 Soon after my arrival at The Hague, Madam Wijnaendts Francken kindly asked me to dine with her and the evening was largely spent in answering questions as to the history of the Founders of the Cause, its principles, and presentday, worldwide activities under Shoghi Effendi's great administrative power. Her quick, enthusiastic response to the immense scope and peace-bringing  cbaracter of the Faith was indeed refreshing, and she asked, ttWhat can I do to help make known this Movement?" 

 Not long afterwards it was encouraging to learn that she had written an article cx-pressing pressing those aspects of the Cause that had particularly attracted her interest, and sent it to the publishers, Nijgh and Von Ditmar, who later brought it out in one of their illustrated magazines, c~were1dkroniek~~ with photographs of Abdu'l-Baha together with the Temples at Wilmette and tlshqi-bid, Turkistin. At the request of Mrs. Stuart W. French of California, this article, which is given below, has been translated into English. 

 Notwithstanding her many public and private engagements, throughout the time I remained at The Hague, Madam Wijnaendts Francken, with thoughtful generosity, helped in many ways to make known a Faith that had been the means of inspiring so exalted an example of heroic sacrifice unto death for the upliftment of womanhood,  as that of the famous disciple of the BTh and Baha'u'llah, Qurratu'1-tAyn, and she hopes to write for the Dutch people a history of that glorious life. 
                           
  WHAT Dors BAHA'I MEAN?     

  Shining temples, the symbol of world unity for the coming years. The light from Inn. 

 Following the adjournment of the International Women's Congress in Chicago, in 1933, many of the foreign and American members were guests at a garden tea-party. In spite of the economic depression of that summer, American hospitality was, I think, practically the same as that I had experienced  in 1925 and '26. It is a regrettable fact that our programs of work and entertainment left us little time for ourselves. 

 When preparations were being made for the conference, while motoring we saw a beautiful building in Wilrnette, a suburb of Chicago. 

 This structure, situated on the 713


<p714>
714             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  shores of the justly famous Lake Michigan, dominates the surrounding scene and many of the European and other guests would have enjoyed prolonging their inspection of the building. 

 Although our view of it was one of short duration, for days afterward it called forth much comment. 

 Seen amidst the lighting effects which Americans have been for years so skilful in producing, and in which the Century of Progress exhibition excelled all previous displays, one can picture (with the aid of the accompanying photograph ~ of the temple) the overwhelming impression this brilliantly illuminated, nine-sided temple made during the night. Those flying over it looked down upon the beauty of a nine pointed star shining far below them. The number Nine contains all other numbers  and symbolizes unity. 

 One of the guests knew the name of this temple, Mashriqu'l-Adhkar; another, was sufficiently adquainted with the Baha'i Movement to know that although the Temple was not yet finished, meetings were held there by the followers of a prophet of lr~n, Baha'u'llah, who lived in the previous century. 

 A third person knew that one of the tenets of their teaching was the absolute equality of the sexes. 

 This information was, naturally, sufficient to arouse our interest, and it was rather extraordinary that in the beginning of the next winter a follower of Baha'u'llah, Miss Louise Drake 'Wright, from Boston, the United States, caine to the Netherlands and that she was willing to grant an interview. 'We were much impressed by her reserve, and the absence of any attempt on her part to impose her own convictions. She was in the Netherlands in accordance with the express wish of the Guardian of the Cause, Shoghi Effendi, who resides in Haifa, Palestine, where his grandfather, CAbdu~1~Bahi had lived. 

If the Baha'i Movement    

 is to awaken more than an intellectual curiosity in the Netherlands, a person like Miss Drake Wright, quiet and reserved in manner, would have to represent it. To call the Baha'i Movement sectarian is a mistake. 

 The Temple itself represents ~     See illustrations of the Temple in another section of the book — Editor. 

 universality and the principles and teachings of its two leading frinian prophets constitute  a basis for world unity. 

 Even as Jesus was preceded by John the Baptist, so Baha'u'llah was preceded by one who called himself the BTh, meaning the door. 

 The unity which the Baha'is seek to establish  will, when put into operation, lead humanity to world peace. 

 It is a remarkable fact that sixty years ago Baha'u'llah, the prophet of IrAn, wrote to Queen Victoria stressing the necessity of establishing a bond of unity among all peoples. 

 A copy of this letter is preserved in the British Museum. It was sent from the prison of tAkki in Palestine, where Baha'u'llah, with his family, spent many of their forty years' imprisonment. His son tAbdu'I-Bahi was his father's constant attendant  until Baha'u'llah died in 1892. When, about thirty years later, the son also passed from the world, 10,000 men and women of many races and classes, followed the bier from Haifa, his dwelling place, part way up Mount Carmel where he was interred, near the last resting place of the Bab. 

 The IrAnian prophet proclaimed the necessity of a world language. At a time when the organized woman's movement had not yet begun to function, he taught that mankind has two wings, one, the man, and the other, the woman. Both wings of a bird must be equally well developed before it can fly. If one wing remains weak flight is impossible. 

 Not until women are placed on an equal footing with men in respect to opportunities and powers of accomplishment can success and welfare develop unhampered as they should. 

 One of the outstanding doctrines of Baha'u'llah was free sharing of one's possessions  with others. 

 This seems even more important than the equality of the sexes, but he says this cannot be attained by means of any coercive measure. 

 These teachings also found expression in a letter written by tAbdu'1-Bahi to the Central Organization for Permanent Peace at The Hague. The executive committee, to whom the letter was addressed, had upon its international list two Dutch names, one at the beginning and the other at the end —


<p715>
A BAHA'I INCIDENT FROM THE NETHERLANDS 715

  H.     C. Dresselhuys, the chairman, and B. de Jong, the secretary. 

 It is interesting to note that the Bab, who was much ahead of his time, proposed the adoption of a uniform calendar for the whole world. The year was to be divided into 19 months having 19 days each, leaving extra days as holidays, between 

February 25th and March    

 2nd. This can be compared to an attempt made later amongst Western peoples who sought to change the calendar for the sake of greater efficiency. 

 The BTh also proposed new names for the months: Splendor, Glory, Beauty, Grandeur, Light, Mercy, Words, Names, Perfection, Might, Will, Knowledge, Power, Speech, Questions, Honor, Sovereignty, Dominion, Loftiness. 

 One doubts if such names will ever find acceptance. 

 It strikes us as a little strange that the Baha'i reckoning of time begins with the revelation of the Rib, 1844, and we must not forget to relate that six years later he died a martyr's death. 

 The fact that Baha'u'llah proposed the establishment of an International Court of Arbitration is of greater interest to us. And when his son, tAbdu'1-BahA, whom Baha'u'llah  named as his successor, was lecturing in Paris in 1913, he proclaimed the necessity of a world Tribunal for the guidance of all peoples, which was to consist of members chosen from each land and government. All grievances of an international character were to be submitted to it, and all causes of war were to be settled by arbitration, thus prohibiting war. Upon the eve of the outbreak  of the world war in 1914, tAbdu'1-Babi was making powerful efforts to bring about international disarmament.

MR. HARALD THILANDER AND
    HIS PUBLICATIONS FOR THE
                   BLIND IN SWEDEN
                 B~ NELLIE S. FRENCH

  DURING our recent brief sojourn in Stockholm, made interesting and valuable through an unexpected and delightful meeting with Miss Martha Root, Baha'i lecturer and teacher, we were able, with her assistance,  to have an interview with one of Sweden's outstanding literary geniuses. Because  of certain efforts in behalf of the blind, Miss Root knew that we would have much in common with Mr. and Mrs. Harald Thulander, and accordingly at an appointed hour, these delightful people came to the Grand Hotel in Stockholm to call on us. If we mention here the physical handicaps under which Mr. Thilander is working it is because of his amazing accomplishments and his beautiful spirit that we venture to do so. Totally blind, and seriously crippled in both arms he must also depend upon an apparatus to convey to him the sound of his wife's voice, for it was through the medium of a conversation in Esperanto with Mrs. Thilander that our messages were conveyed to him. Mrs. Thulander herself is nearly sightless, and since she was unacquainted with the English language we found Esperanto  our best vehicle, although Mr. Thilander being master of six languages modestly replied to us in English. 

  Our interview naturally turned upon the subject of the Baha'i Faith of which Mr. Thilander had first learned through a small booklet which he had received from Miss Root some time before. 

 So attracted was he to the spirit and principles of the Faith because as he puts it, "It is the religion of life, built upon deeds — not merely words," that he translated the booklet into Esperanto Braille, and sent a copy of it to each of the subscribers to his various magazines and a large quantity to Dr. Echner in Praha. 

  Besides being an accomplished linguist Mr. Thilander is the owner and editor of a number of periodicals. 

 An enumeration of these will give an idea of the large amount of work which Mr. Thilander accomplishes. This he does through the aid of a man who reads to him, and an office force consisting of two blind men and one who sees. 

 One of the Swedish publications has a circulation of nine hundred fifty. Its title translated into English is rcT1~e NVeeldy Review  for the Blind." Mr. Thilander chooses and edits all the material which is printed in this weekly. 

 In this connection he was deeply interested in the fact that Miss Helen Keller had read of the Baha Cause and had received and graciously acknowledged some Baha'i books in Braille. 

 His most important publication in Swedish  Braille is ctcefrata Rondo," a religious paper which is founded on liberal ideas and expresses the liberal church. This has a subscription list of five hundred sixty-five. A quarterly Esperanto magazine is called "Lumo Sur Lavojo." 

The t~Esperanto Ligilo"   
has one thousand readers. 

 Then there is the ttRadio Journal," a Swedish weekly for the blind. The "Northland Musical Gazette," printed in Norwegian, Swedish and Danish has a monthly cir —  culation of one hundred fifty. Mr. Thilander also publishes three foreign magazines,  one Spanish, one Irish and one Bulgarian. 

 Besides the above and !CL~~ which appears semiannually, there is a Magazine" published in Swedish Braille in 716

THE MODERN MIRACLES
                    OF PALESTINE
                  B~ BEATRICE IRWIN

AMONG the "Hidden Words"   

 which embody the sacred utterances of Baha'u'llah translated from the 1r6.nian we find these words, "Be ye as great trees bearing broad leaves and fragrant fruits," which is a thought peculiarly appropriate to the subject  under discussion. For ours is an age of spiritual springtide in which we see the miracle of many lands, being simultaneously reborn before our eyes. 

 Through evolution and revolution, the whole earth is emerging from age-old inertias,  from prejudices, and from fettering traditions into a verdant and vigorous growth of expanded life, quickened mentality,  and new outlooks that may well be compared to the annual miracle of spring. 

 Perhaps some of us take these wonders of life too much for granted, and because we live in the midst of them, we lose the sense of their joy and wonder; others, subject  them only to the critical analysis of scientific phenomena, but to world-travelers it is sometimes granted to pass beyond both these stages of perception and to become active partakers, as well as eyewitnesses, of those silent mysteries of growth and fevers of spiritual unrest that always precede the rebirth of lands and peoples. 

  Palestine, more intimately known as the Holy Land, is approximately only two hundred miles long by one hundred and fifty wide. 

 It has taken, and is still playing, one of the most powerful and dramatic rOles in the great pageant of world reconstruction.  Within its small area it is subject to many climatic extremes which have had their influence on its historic developments and peoples. 

 Bounded on the west by the Mediterranean, on the east by the desert of Transjordania, and stretching from the cool heights of Lebanon, 1200 feet above sea-level, to the Dead Sea, 1400 feet below sea — level its seasons are divided between six months of dry heat and desert winds, and six months of moderate rain and sunshine producing line fruits and a senhi-tropical vegetation. 

 The tremendous drama of the struggle between the Kings of Israel and the Prophets of God seems to have impregnated this small portion of earth with a deathless spiritual magnetism that at intervals focuses its power, and acts definitely and dramatically as a lever for the uplift of humanity. 

 rollowing the early struggles of Israel, the Crusades continued the inspiring traditions  of the Holy Land, and then the Turks held it in thrall, for seven hundred years, till in the World War General Lord Allenby made his historic entry into Jerusalem on foot, and Palestine became a British Mandate. 

 Such, briefly, is the background against which the modern miracles of this land are fulfilling the Bible prophecy that ccCarmel and Sharon shall see the Glory of the Lord." In the year 1868 Baha'u'llah with His family and a small band of disciples were imprisoned for supposed sedition in the worst criminal prison of Palestine in tAkki which some chronicles call the (Coldest city on earth." Here he dwelt in close confinement with all its attendant hardships for several years, and then at the request of the governor of the city, He was granted a house at Baha some miles distant, where, though still under restrictions, He was allowed  to pass the remainder of His life, receiving the pilgrims that visited from all lands, and writing those books of law and wisdom that are the basis of the New World Order, that it was His divine mission to 719

720             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  proclaim! These principles of unity are painfully but surely becoming operative throughout the world, and Baha'i literature has already been translated into thirty different  tongues. 

 Baha'u'llah ascended in November, 1892, leaving the promulgation of his work to His son tAbdu'1-BaM, and so the first of the modern miracles of Palestine was achieved, and the breeze of spiritual freedom began to rise, unobserved, save by the few. Among this minority, however, were certain Turkish officials, who communicated to their government  that Abdu'l-Baha was employing his comparative freedom and newly acquired leadership and leisure in the construction of an imposing building on Mount Carmel, which they inferred was destined to become a fort for operations against Turkey. 

 In reality, this historic edifice, already prophesied in Scripture, and whose location and plan had been selected by Baha'u'llah, was to be a shrine for the mortal remains of the BTh. Turkish intrigue, however, refused  to interpret its erection otherwise than in terms of its own suspicions, and so tAbdu'1-Bahi was once more placed under strict confinement till again, as by a miracle, he was freed in 1908, by the coup d'&at of the young Turk's revolution! 

 At the moment  CAbdu~1~Bahi actually lay under sentence of death by tAbdu'1-Hamid, but had been secretly offered the means of escape by an Italian ship that lay in the harbor of tAkk~. He refused — saying that the B&b and Baha'u'llah had never turned their backs on danger nor would He. 

 Under these unique and historic circumstances CAbdu~1~Ba1~4 inaugurated His personal mission  of teaching, and the third phase in the unfolding of the Baha'i Revelation began. 

 It is important to note in this connection that in Turkey, where women had been most fettered, they now come ciose to leading  the world in the rightful enjoyment of their freedom and privileges. 

 Another significant fact is that the Turkish Revolution was the first of those rapidly succeeding upheavals, spiritual and economic that have since disrupted nearly every inhabited portion of the earth. 

 Palestine is still among these smouldering spiritual volcanos for within its restricted area Jews, Arabs and the British are trying to soive the problems of racial amity and economic understandings. 

 Simultaneously with the conflagrations that are burning away outworn prejudices, other constructive forces have been building new foundations in Palestine, and the statistics  of these are bewildering in their magnitude. 

 When He was charged with sedition, Baha'u'llah replied, CCW desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations, that all nations should become one in faith, and that diversity of religion should cease and differences of race be annulled Of all the lands that are inevitably advancing to the fulfillment of this hope, Palestine is one of the most spectacular in its promise and achievements, emerging as it has done in such a short space of time from a primitive and pastoral community into an arena for some of the greatest engineering and cultural feats of our day. 

    Before the 'World NVar     

 (1914) Palestine had few railways or even motor roads; in fact in 1912, only two motors were registered  and communication was largely dependant on caravan trails. Now, thousands of motor cars are registered, and up to date railways and airways abound. 

 The shining sea of Galilee surrounded by its golden sandstone cliffs, is an air and water port for giant planes that, flying at the rate of 120 miles an hour, make this point their halt between Europe and Asia, after achieving the flight between England and Palestine in three days. 

 Till 1933, Haifa, situated on the historic Bay of tAkk~ had only a port of natural beauty, and ocean liners were obliged to dock some miles out. 

 On October 31, 1933, the British government threw open a port which has cost over a million pounds, a fact that marks a milestone in Haifa's history, giving the town a new international and industrial importance, and making it a link between the near and far East that has extensive implications for economic developments. 

 One of the most important of these is that Haifa has become the terminal of the


<p721>
THE MODERN MIRACLES OF PALESTINE                                721

  giant pipeline which conducts oil for six hundred twenty-seven miles across the desert, from Mosul in tlrAq to be tapped at this point into barrels and distributed around the world! In its long wanderings, this oil pipe follows for a while the course of the Tigris and Euphrates, whose valley legend connects with the Garden of Paradise,  and it also passes over the cavern where Saul is supposed to have consulted the Witch of Endor. The obstacles overcome in the difficult achievement of its construction present a fairy tale of science, and one of the greatest engineering feats of this, or of any age! 

 Before the war the Dead Sea was still the Dead Sea, but now owing to the enterprise  of Scottish scientists and engineers this vast sheet of water, five times as salty as any ocean, and lying 1400 feet below sea level, has been made to produce potash and bromine, the latter product being used extensively in chemical products and dyestuffs. 

 Cooperatively with this industrial activity, picturesque building operations have materialized so that the Dead Sea whose borders were once the lone retreat of hawk and heron, is now a smiling summer resort for the city dwellers of Palestine, and its blue waters are whitened by the foam of speedboats. 

 Domestic architecture of a new and interesting character is nnnifesting in both pub —  1k and private buildings, notably in the model Jewish colony of Tel-Aviv situated a few miles from Haifa. 

Here the Zionist Movement  

 has shown itself well worthy of the 285,000 ars of land which it has acquired  for socialization, and the Jew has proved himself capable of being as good a farmer as he is a business man. 

 The fine international university, built on the Mount of Olives outside Jerusalem, also carries on the tradition of Hebrew learning in an expanded spirit. From these three outstanding projects accomplished within seventeen years — I refer to the development of the Dead Sea, the construction of the Port Haifa and the laying of the oil-pipe —  we can see that even materially Palestine is a land of modern miracles. Statistics show that her main towns have doubled their population in ten years, and that street lighting has become prevalent, owing to the electrical development engineered from the Jordan by the enterprise of a brilliant Russian 

Jew.                       

 America and England have also contributed  new and notable buildings to the glory of Jerusalem, the former has erected a palatial Y.M.C.A. and museum buildings, the latter a new government house, and the handsome St. David's Hotel. 

 But in conclusion let us drift back to Haifa, which in reality holds the key to all these bewildering activities, for here the creative and holy dust of prophet and martyr mingle, and are enshrined in a ver-data  and spellbinding beauty that chal —  lenges the world! Half way up on Mount Carmel there is unfolded another miracle, a nine-terraced garden which in a few years has been landscaped from the rocky hillside into a modern Eden, where one is led through avenues of palm and cypress, and through flowering progressions of almond, fig and pomegranate blooms, through reefs of roses, stocks, and hyacinths, to the silence of a golden sandstone shrine. Simple, strong and majestic in outline this building has two beautiful vaulted chambers. In one of these reposes the remains of the Bib, he who in 1844 prophesied the coming of the new World Redeemer, 

Baha'u'llah, (18631892)   

 and in the other rests cAbd~1BhA the son of Baha'u'llah, who traveled and expounded His Father's teachings throughout  Europe, America and Palestine in a mission that lasted from 1892 to 1921 when He ascended, conferring the furtherance of his work to His grandson, Shoghi Effendi, and to the body of Baha'i believers throughout  the world. 

 Among the countless services which tAbdu'1-Bah6t inspiration rendered to a disillusioned world, the plan for this beautiful garden was one of the most merciful and healing. Ships from all lands discharge their travelers at Haifa, and they stream through these shrine gardens. 

 It is not to be wondered at that this oasis of love and beauty inspires inquiry, and a very serious consideration of the great lives that it commemorates, lives that looked so far into the future and that built such a

A NEW FUTURE FOR RADIO
                  B~ SHIRLEY WARDE

  YVLL radio some day be the means of transmitting the Baha'i message to millions of listeners at a time? 'Will it be a new and vaster teaching medium through which the principles of Baha'u'llah will infuse the world? 
I believe it will.        

 Surely in this age of unity, as proclaimed by 

Baha'u'llah, the Divine    

 Educator has brought not oniy the Book but the means of promulgating it. If the Baha'i teachings are for all peoples they must reach all peoples and there is no other medium today whereby human thought can be so easily molded as through radio. Even the printed word must suffer in comparison for it Lacks the intimacy and conviction of the voice, and wide though the circulation of some particular publication may be it cannot possibly  reach so many persons in a given time. 

 Surely such a powerful instrument for the influencing of humanity could not be destined to serve solely as a means of selling produce or of purveying entertainment. The discerning must recognize in radio a divine instrument designed for a divine purpose,  obscure though that purpose may be at this time. 

  Through the enormous success achieved by manufacturers through this method of advertising, radio has naturally given more and more time to commercial broadcasts, necessarily cutting down on the purely educational  programs that were more frequent during the early days of radio history. Sponsors have in turn sought only to entertain  their listeners, feeling that this was the surest way of getting an audience for their commercial story. The result has been that radio has seemed stopped at this point, the oniy apparent progress being the production of more lavish entertainment. 

 But the fall of 1935 brought a program that opened up a new vision and will, I believe, lieve, influence the entire future of radio broadcasting. 

 By the grace of Baha'u'llah I was privileged to be one of those responsible for this program. From a germ of an idea that came across my desk at the 

Columbia Broadcasting    

 Company the conception of a program  dedicated to World Peace came into being, grew and was developed. 

 After securing  the cooperation of World Peace-ways, a nonprofit, nonpolitical organiza-don  for peace education which has been doing a splendid work for this cause, we selected the sponsor we felt should be most interested, although everyone told us that no advertiser would invest in an ideal, and went to work to sell our idea. 

 That E. R. Squibb & Sons, manufacturing  chemists, and their advertising agency, Geyer-Cornell & Newell, immediately saw the timeliness of this program and the tremendous  possibilities of capturing the atten-don of the American public on an issue that was of paramount importance, was a matter of keen business judgment. But that they should be willing to risk the large sums involved in broadcasting in a program which by its very nature would forbid any direct selling of merchandise and the sales results of which would depend entirely upon the good will the program might promote was a decision that took rare courage and sincere devotion to the cause they sought to promote. 

 The results have more than justified  that decision. 

     CCTO Arms! For Peace!"    

 at this writing in its eighth week over a coast to coast Columbia network, has received sensational acclaim and has started an entirely new trend in radio programs. 

 Let me quote a few of the press comments as an example of what the nation's radio critics have had to say: 

     The Women's National Radio
Committee                 
725


<p726>
726             THE BALlASt WORLD

  reports: "By unanimous opinion this is the best radio program which has ever been staged and it would exhaust all our adjectives  to do justice to it." CCThis peace program is one of the most forward advances in constructive education  by radio that has come across the air." 

 ~tTo radio this striking union of business and humanitarian effort may be more important  than whether World Peaceways can keep America out of the threatened European conflict." 

 "Radio could not be put to a worthier purpose. 

 If you missed the first broadcast  don't miss the next. If you heard the first program you won't miss the next." 

 ttA most effective show     The sponsor is to be congratulated and thanked for the splendid reticence that keeps all commercial talk away from the precious halfhour of time available." 

 In addition hundreds of papers throughout  the country have given the program editorial space and have written columns about it. The halfhour itself is designed to appeal as high-grade entertainment; at the same time forcefully putting across its message. Against a background of a large symphony orchestra and chorus we present each week a guest star from the operatic and concert stages, such as Lucrezia Bori, 

Jascha Heifetz, Richard    
Bonelli, Rosa Ponselle,    

Lotte Lehman,  Albert     
Spaulding, Jose Iturbi     

 and many others. Each week there is a guest speaker. 

 These have been national figures, Senator William A. Baha, General Hugh S. Johnson, Ruth Bryan 

Owen, Professor Robert    

 A. Millikan, Senator Gerald P. Nyc, Alfred E. Smith among others. 

 Here, on what is termed the CcForum~~ these prominent persons present his or her view on peace, commenting on what steps we should take towards this goal or what mistakes we are making. 

 Many interesting and varied opinions have been expressed exposing all sides of the question for the benefit of enlightened public opinion. 

 In each program there is also a short dramatic sketch, either an original written for the program by the world's leading authors, or an adaptation of some famous play or book dealing with the war question. 

 These sketches are our main plea for peace as they present in dramatic form and from the human angle the horrors, the futility and the suffering of war. Some depict the agonies of the actual battle front, others the tragedy of those left at home, still others showing the cruelties, the selfishness and greed that go into the making of war. We have chosen stories of many nations, of French soldiers, German, Austrian, American, English, so that listeners may realize that mankind is one, living and dying in the same way, and that ffidividuals, be they friend or enemy, are all mere pawns in the hands of those who make wars. 

 In our music, too, we have tried to cultivate the international heart, showing music as a common language which all people can understand, of whatever race, creed or nationality they may be and pointing out that if in music we can find a basis of understanding, why not in life? 

 These are the educational factors of the program and the entertainment values. In addition there is a practical feature which, we hope, may prove of real influence  in forcing America to exert even greater efforts to maintain the peace of the world. 

 In over forty thousand drugstores throughout the United States the firm of E. R. Squibb & Sons has placed a pledge known as the CCWorld Peaceways" pledge. Listeners are asked to sign this statement of their adherence to the cause of peace. The pledge is addressed to the President and the Congress of the United States and reads: "I pledge my wholehearted adherence to the cause of peace, in the firm belief that an end may be put, by honorabk means, to the destruction of life by the merciless machinery of war." 

  Up to date oniy a small proportion of the drugstores have returned signed slips. From oniy four thousand drugstores we have received  over a hundred and fifty thousand pledges. 

 If the rest are proportionate it means that in less than eight weeks nearly two and a half million persons have signed these pledges. 

 We hope to build this total to many millions. 
The pledges are being


<p727>
A NEW FUTURE FOR RADIO                                  727

  bound in books of a thousand each and when the returns are complete the total will be sent to the President just as they are without plea of any sort, for we firmly believe that they will be eloquent evidence that this nation demands peace, and we feel that such a voice of enlightened public opinion cannot fail to be a powerful influence in directing American policy. 

 I hope and pray that this program may lead other advertisers to devote their resources  to humanitarian and educational efforts and already thought is turning along this trail we have blazed. I await now the day when our beloved Cause of Baha'u'llah may be proclaimed along the airways and reach the heart of every searching soui through this great gift of God — radio.

       RECOGNITION                

  Hail to Thee, Scion of Glory, whose utterance poureth abroad The joy of the heavenly knowledge and the light of the greatest of Days Poet of mysteries, chanting in rapture the beauty of Cod, Unto thee be thanksgiving and praise! 

  Child of the darkness that wandered in gloom but dreamed of the light, Lo, I have seen Thy splendor ablaze in the heavens afar Showering gladness and glory, and shattering the shadows of night And seen no other star! 

  Thy words are to me as fragrances borne from the gardens of heaven, Beams of a lamp that is hid in the height of a holier world, Arrows of fire that pierce and destroy with the might of the levin Into our midnight hurled! 

  Sword of the Father! none other can rend the dark veil from my eyes, None other can beat from my limbs with the shearing blade of God's might The sins I am fettered withal and give me the power to se And come forth to the fijiness of light. 

  Lo! Thou hast breathed on my sorrow the sweetness of faith and of hope, Thou East chanted high paeans of joy that my heart's echoes ever repeat And the path to the knowledge of God begins to glimmer and ope Before my faltering feet. 

  Weak and unworthy my praise. 

 Yet as from its throbbing throat Some lone bird pours its song to the flaming infinite sky, So unto Thee in the zenith I lift from a depth remote This broken human cry.

 of the Universe Whence sprang adown the ages glorious orbs To illume the abysmal darkness of mankind And manifest on earth the self of God —  '~'hat hast Thou now bestowed to clear the mists That still o'erhang the consciousness of soul And hide from it the vision of the Infinite? 

 Out of the East, as ever, comes the dawn Of a new day. Again the wondrous light Shines from the horizon of Thy boundlessness, Only this day in such effulgent power As ne'er before. There leaps into the sky A sun which to the eyes of groping men Reveals a vista to that perfect day, Nor yet a distant day, when all the earth Bathed in Its beauty shall be purified And all Thy creatures realize their oneness With all their kind and

 They have announced Through all the worlds: ~There is no God save Him!"

  To Him be Glory Who doth by His Pen Cause Verses to descend on knowing hearts! 

  Blest is My God Who on this Servant bath Caused to descend Words guiding to His Path! 

  Blest is My God Who such calamity flath sent upon this Servant that the hearts Of those within eternal Gates were rent With anguish, and those near to God with pain. 

  Blest is My God Who from the clouds of fate Hath rained the arrows of disasters great, And yet bath found this 

Servant of His Throne      

 In Patience equalled but by God alone! 
                           
Blest is My God from Whose 

 Decree appears —  For which I thank Him — detestation's spears! 

  To Him be praise Who on this Servant hath Caused to descend the torrents of men's wrath! 

 For which I praise Him — yea, for this I yearn! 

 Blest are the souL who with their hearts discern!

(Spoken)                   

 When at the summit of calamity I raised My eyes and, Lo! there shone A Light from God, and in that Light a form —  An angel of surpassing loveliness. 

  Upon her face such happiness was writ —  Such exultation on her brow — that all My being was in tumult, and such joy Possessed Me that the dungeon was forgot. 

  Then, with her finger pointed at My head, She called to all in heaven and earth and said: swear by God the world's Beloved One Is here, if men but understand. The Sun Supreme shines in His mirroring heart. 

 Lo, this Is God's own Beauty incarnate again! 

This is God's Majesty      
enthroned 'mongst men!     

 If oniy they would list and heed His Word! 

 This is God's mystery, His treasure and His Glory and the Source of His Command!"

Worten                     
 "Ich glaube dir" aus seiner

Vaterhand.                 

  So gleitet die Seele aus herrlichen Hbhen hernieder turn Leben im irdischen Schoss und vereint sich dem Fleisch, das in Wehen sich windet, und eratmet sich jauchzcnd Priigung und Los. 

  Dann aber spannt sich aufw~rts die Spirale. Noch saugt sie glijubig von der Mutter Brust die guten wie die blutverdorbenen Male und glaubt ihr treuverwandt und unbewust. 

  Durch der Kiudheit Gefilde huft sie dahin, ihrer himmlischen Heimat kauni mehr gewahr. Mit froher Begierde ergreift sic das Leben und baut sich die Binge Jahre urn 

Jahr.                      

  Bald hat sich so gewaltig angesammelt an jJugendkraft cm kernig Lebensstiick. tJnd, was das Herze auch verworren stammelt —  die Seek glaubt an sich und an ihr Gijick. 

  Und sehnt sich unendlich hinein in das Dunkel verheissender Zukunft, und findet nicht Ruh. Da erlebt sie die Andere, die Schwesterseele, die Traute, die Eine, das herrijehe flu. 

  So hMt die Macht der Liebe sic urnschlungen. Sie schliirft der Wonne siisses Elixir und fiihlt vom Andern sich so tief durchdrungen und glaubt ibm, gleich wie einem Stuck von ihr. 

  Da packt sie die Welt, cm lockender Garten, in pr~chtigen Farben em funkeind Gewand. Und sie treibt sich herum zwischen 

Lachen und TrThen, Zagen   

 und Hoffen, Perlen und Tand, his sich die Schuld an ihre Schwelle kauert, bis ibr das Leid durch schwere Tr~ume zieht. Da fiihlt sic, wie kein Ding zu lange dauert, und wie doch alles — ach! — so rasch -verfliebt. 

  So ersreht ihr der Glaube an den Einen, den Starken,


<p731>
den nimmerverg~ng1ichen Vater der 'Welt. Und sie liebt wie cm Kind ihn und sehnt sich ihm nTher und will nur noch leben, wie ihm es gefkllt. 

  Sic sucht, wo sic den Gott im Glauberi fasse, durchschweift die praclitigen Reiche der Natur, der Kiinste Tempel md des Wissens Masse, und fiihlt dort iiberall der Heimat Spur. 

  Doch am helisten erstrahlet die Sonne der Wahrheit im volikominensten Spiegel, im 

Propheten aus Gott:        

 In seinem Geist, im erhabenen Beispiel, irn belebenden Worte, in Zucht und Gebot. 

  Wie sie auf diesem Pfade mutig schreitet, lernt sic mit eigenen Augen kiarer schaucn. Durch rcchte Tat wird Him und 

Herz geweitet, Vernunft    

 und Glaube kannen sich vertraimn. 

  So schwingt sich die Seele dern heiligen Ruf des Schbpfers entgegen, der einsr sie ersehuf. Durch Glaube begnadet zu ewigem Gijick, findet sie wieder zum Vater zuriick.

       THE BELOVED                

 A son of separation had traveled to a far off country and, Satiated with the non — satisfying fruits of desire, Longed with an ever-increasing longing for the home of his Beloved. 

 ~Where can I find my heart's desire? Where, oh where, is the land of my Beloved?" 

 So    loving, seeking and longing, on the wings of vision he traveled Through many kingdoms and spheres, seeking; Perchance he might find Him who alone could allay the hunger of his soul. 

 He traveled through many lands; In every niche, corner and place the traveler found signs of his Beloved 

One;                       

 Stately fanes, gleaming shrines in a1~baster purity, Flowers of beauteous hues with delectable fragrance, All redolent of the Traceless 

Friend.                    

 In embroidered fabrics of many hues — in ornate design and symbols old —  1 — us traces were present on every hand. But still his longing remained unallayed and, weary of search, He sat down and wept. 

  The longing unassuaged, again impelled to the search of the Friend, Again he went forth and on the wings of hearing he traveled. 

 "Perhaps through the kingdom of hearing I may find Him I love —  Perchance I may hear the melodies of His voice that will allay the longing of my heart." He traveled long and far. 

 In rolling chant and music of many lands, faint echoes of His Beloved's voice he discerned; But instead of soothing it increased the hunger that made his life a fretful dream. 

 His nights were full of unrest, his days but lonely despair. 

 His longing but grew stronger and more intense; He sought again in churches and temples fair. 

 Perchance in stately chant and ancient word the voice of his Beloved may be heard. 

 He listened and from a far off land came words That through the circumambient air soothed and calmed his love torn soui "My son, give me thy heart." 

 ~Come unto me ye who art weary and heavy laden with care." 

 Love me that I may love thee." —  And soothed and comforted he slept content. 

  Again he hungered for the Friend and his heart's desire; Nothing but attainment could allay his inward fire. Not by vision of mortal eye nor by sounds on fleshly ear, Can I find my home and my Beloved." 

 Again the lover pondered, ~Not by vision, Not by hearing can I find my quest." 

 Again he set forth, this time on the wings of Love, That ineffable Love that penetrates all space, Overcomes all barriers, passes through all veils. 

 Behold as this lover swept through the halls of limitless  space, The Beloved of his heart from the unattainable heights of glory Met and enveloped him with the glorious garment of His Beauteous Robe —  The goal was won, his hunger forever appeased, his eternal home attained, The journey ended and the eternal reunion, that nothing can sever, was made. 

  ~'Now what shall be the measure of his devotion?" No longer perturbed by grievous longing and desire, This disciple hastens forth with shining eyes, an undaunted courage, an undying faith. 

 No longer futile in word and act by his human frailty, But armed with the sword of truth, robed in the garments of devotion,


<p732>
Crowned with the crown of severance, filled with the Holy Spirit, Encircled by the glory of the divine Presence, With the tongue of power and lowliness of Jesus, And perfect worldly detachment and severance; A witness on earth to the Glory of the Most High, He sets forth to complete his earthly pilgrimage, To win the victory with the power of the Spirit over the hearts of men, To be a shining star in the darkness of mortal life, A tree to guide the wanderers of the desert to their heavenly home. 

  Is it not told in an Eastern parable how the lover longed for his Beloved; How he made a long and arduous journey to the home of his 

Beloved;               

 Flow when the lover arrived at the door that separated  him from his heart's desire He knocked once, twice, and once again. 

 Behind this door that stood between the lover and his heart's desire, He heard the Beloved's voice saying in gentle tones, ~'Who is there? Who is there?" 

 The lover replied in faltering tones, "It is I," But no answer came, the door remained closed. 

 Sorrowing, with many tears, the lover returned to earthly life. 

  But longing was not appeased, and torn with hope and despair Again he assayed this journey to the home of his Beloved. 

 Again he knocked with trembling hand, one, twice, and once again, Once again was hear the gentle voice, "Who is there? Who is there?" 

 This time the lover, with sobbing voice, "It is not I, but Thou!" 

 As the lover waited at the threshold of this door That hides the Traceless Beloved from mortal eye, —  behold — it opened, Radiant light streamed forth, and, enveloping the lover, reunited him forever '~'ith the Eternal 

Beloved.

God — the Ancient One —  Revives
the heart of man.      

 "Thus have the signs descended And the matter been decreed." 
For the sincere ones,  

His Message is ~a Sea  
of Light."             

 For the deniers among His creatures And the impious, "it is a Ball of Fire!" 

  0    misery of men! No Messenger has come to you, But He has been denied, reviled and execrated, As no pen dare describe. 

That sinless Essence   

 of Humility, Who wears the precious Diadem of God's Command, And brings the priceless Book, To which the hosts of heaven certify. 

 Through Him man's knowledge came — of God; The vision of obedience and love. 

 He did adorn with Faith the consciousness of man, Enkindle reverence and true submission. 

 But wily those endowed with hearing And with "the iron sight" May comprehend the Fragrance of that 

Presence.

Only One was left: Baha'u'llah!
Serene and awe-inspiring!  

 And He — destined to reach "the plains of 'Akka, 

The Banquet Hall of God!"  

 Is in a dungeon, in the bowels of earth, Where no light can penetrate, In chains and stocks, Breathing stench with thieves and murderers! 

 He, that shall change the earth into a Paradise!

 The Day of Oneness is at hand. 

  The Balances are laid in Justice, All hidden issues are disclosed: And we will hold the reigns of government, And make the Peace that you opposed. 

  The Night is passing, and the morrow Will find us with attentive mind A-forging and reforging still The broken fortunes of mankind. 

  The Rivers strained from out their courses To wash some conqueror's domain Will now forget their Long abasement And find the Ocean once again. 

  For ours will be the Light of Justice And ours the fortitude sublime To bring back rivers to their sources And men to men in every clime. 

  Our task will be a task of grandeur Supernal and Elysian —  For here is a planet to refashion Into a peaceful home for man. 

  And here are barriers to sunder, And hearts to render free and rife, And souls to teach that they are Kindred, 

  Upon the Ancient Tree      

 of Life —  The Offspring of one Holy Eather, The Children of one Mother E~rrh; For in the long and drear dispersion Mankind forgot their common birth. 

  Ab! Ours will be the work stupendous, And superhuman the Ideal, But We will have the lasting ardor, And We will know the Martyr's zeal To end the falsehood and delusion Of many Gods and many Nations, Of many Creeds, and many Races, And high and iow degrees and stations. 

 And nevermore will Tyranny Command the Peoples, or console, Nor greed, nor exile, nor banishment Obstruct the Light from any Soul. 

  For in our hands will be the Power, And in our hearts the Emanation, The love of Kind that hears and haloes And blesses with divine creation. 

  And we will heal men of their Blindness And they will be like Seers and Sages —  A race reborn and transfigured Returning to the God of

HOLY MOUNTAIN — A PRAYER (Written
to a Pilgrim to      

Haifm, Palestine)    

  Take my heart to Mt. Carmel, 0  friend of the Golden 

Dawn!                

 I've tried to send silver and incense, At my touch they have faded and gone; Rose petals have turned to ashes And floated away in tears, My deeds of the past and the present Oh, there's nothing but on-coining years To give to the Lord of the Ages, So, the life of the future that's mine, Take it, my friend, and lay it At the High and Holy 

Shrine.              

  Take my heart to Mt. Carmel, o  friend of the Shining 

Light!               

 And as you go, remember, The world is crying tonight, Out of sorrow and anguish, Calling to you and to me, 

Asking the Life Eternal

 That is found on betided knee, 

The Life with Love   

 enkindled, The power, the peace, the pulse — throb, The exuberant joy and the splendor That is known on the Mountain of 

God.                 

  Take my heart to Mt. Carmel, Thou radiant servant of Day! 

 And there under azure heavens Where the sun sends a pure white ray, Where breezes are healing and holy, Where rains wash clean and renew, Lay it among the flowers, Rich blossoms fragrant with dew; Oh, pray that this, my offering, Be cleansed on that sacred sod, That I may give to earth-children Of the Life that conies from God! 

               — ALICE Cox.

      FULFILMENT                    

  He, whom the world had exiled and reviled, 'I~o Haifa came — and distant 

               Hermon smiled And Akka       

 gleamed and Garmel proudly glanced O'er sunlit waves that rose and fell and danced. "This is the One," the sea-wind broke in song, '~Who comes to reign, to triumph over Wrong; This is the Day wherein the Heavens are thrilled And earth shall find all prophecies fulfilled. Bring forth your flowers, Jezreel, to brightly greet The Lord of Love who treads with iowiy feet The sacred dust of your immortal land And uttereth Peace by Cod's Supreme Command. This is Baha, the glory of the Lord, Whose golden heart with Heavenly gifts is stored!" "0 Blessed Day," a land-breeze gently sighed, "The Light bath dawned for which the martyrs died!" —  And through the world an etherial tremor ran Which even now is slowly changing Man. 
                — E. T. HALL.                  

               THE TEMPLE BEAUTIFUL          

  o Temple of the Beautiful, 0 Temple of the Lord; 

               That for God's Oneness        
               e'er will stand, And for      

               His Holy Word;                

 Thy radiance shall shine afar, As shines the sun above, A refuge thou to weary hearts, A Fortress of 

               God's Love.                   

  o Temple that doth symbolize, God's Word made flesh to man; Thou art the body of His Law, Revealing His great 

               Plan;                         

 All nations shall in Thee rejoice And gather from afar; Shall hold aloft the Glorious Name. That Name — Baha'u'llah. 

  o Temple of true Unity Of Knowledge and of Light, o Temple of the Living God; Of day that knows no night;


<p736>
736 thou art a mystery divine, But one that all may read Who enter in with hearts made pure, With Faith and loving deed. 

  0  Temple of the Beautiful, 0 Miracle sublime! 

 In Thee the nations join as one, From every land and clime; Thou art the symbol of God's Peace, Which cometh from above; The symbol of His Word 

Divine, His Manifested

NEW SONGS TO SING          

 Too long have we borne with rancor And woes of an ancient weaving! 

 Too long have we borne with conflict —  And what have they brought us but grieving! 

  Behold! 'We have cleared our hearts Of each bitter and withering thing: We have seen a Light in the Darkness: We have New Songs to sing! 
                           
     WE CAN SEE AT LAST         

  Our eyes, that were blinded with groping Are healed! We can see at last! 

 We can see all around every limit, And Beyond our portionless past! 

  Never more shall we hate at a bidding, Or slay at a warrior's command! 

 At last we can see that the earth Is really one native land! 

     WE HAVE WINGS              

 We have Wings! We may fly, at last! 

 At last we may search and explorel We may soar, at will, like the angels, We shall chafe in confinement no more! Past the fogs and the mists of tradition Our flight will be steady and smooth: We have Wings of Faith and of Reason, At last we shall search out the Truth! 
                           
      WE ARE ~REB                

 \Ve are free! We shall sing to the world, We shall sing to the sad and the drear! 

 We have Truth and Beauty to give —  All the nations shall waken and hear! 

  We shall quicken the dead with our singing, We shall free all the bound! We are strong: We shalt sing of the 

Oneness of Mankind And     

 renew all the earth with our Song! 
                           
     OF A NEW REVELATION        

  Away with all blind imitation! 

 Away with ancestral belief sI \Ve have done with the strife they engendered, We have done with humanity's griefs! 

  We sing of a new Revelation, Of a Cycle untrammeled by rage! We sing of Divine Civilization, 

        And Humanity's Coming      
of Age!                    
                           
    LIKE THE FALCONS           

  We shall fly, neath the sky, like the falcons And lift up our Voices with strength! 

 Far and near over Valleys and Mountains We shall cry the Good Tidings at length! 

  We shall fly, neath the sky, like the falcons And cry to the dwellers on earth: The! the ways of all freedom are opened, And the gates to the ways of rebirth!"
