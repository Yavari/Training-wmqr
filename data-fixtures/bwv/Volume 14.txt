PREFACE

  THE successive volumes of The Baha'i World have come to be anticipated by Baha'is as the record of their own collective endeavours on behalf of their Faith, of the establishment t and development of its administrative order throughout the world and as the source of data, both historical and statistical, relating to the rise of that Faith during its formative e age. 

  By librarians and students The Baha'i World is becoming ever more widely known as a source of authentic information about the aims, tenets, history, activities, organization and growth of the Baha'i Faith. The editors therefore have always in mind the preservation n of an even balance between the presentation of material of supreme interest to believers and of a fair and objective picture to enquirers. In this they are guided by the policy of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, who directed the compilation of the successive volumes from Ito XII covering the years 1925 to 1954. The first volume, known as Baha'i Year Book, was in fact a one year survey; the next seven volumes were biennial, terminating in 1940; volume IX recorded the four years from 1940 to 1944; volume X was again biennial and volumes XI and MI presented the periods 1946 — 1950 and 1950 — 1954 respectively. All these volumes were published in the United States under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly, volume I being compiled by an editorial committee of American Baha'is, and the remainder by an international board of editors, all under the supervision of the Guardian of the Faith. Volume XIII, which recorded the passing of the Guardian and the course and completion of his Ten Year Crusade, covered the entire period from 1954 to 1963 and was produced under the supervision of the Universal House of Justice, which thenceforth assumed responsibility for publication. 

  This volume, XIV, relates to the years 1963 to 1968, the centenary period of the announcement t and initial proclamation by Baha'u'llah of His Mission, and of His second, third and fourth exiles, which terminated in His arrival at the "Most Great Prison" of 'AttA. Volume XIV, therefore, presents the record of these world-shaking events together r with the text of the "Great Announcement" and an essay by Shoghi Effendi on Baha'u'llah. The centenary period was further enriched by the completion, with the election of the Universal House of Justice, of the administrative structure of BahA'u'-lidli's s World Order.

INTRODUCTION

              AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE
                    BAHA'I FAITH

                   By DAVID HOEMAN

  IRELIGION has two objectives, the regeneration  of men and the advancement of mankind. "All men have been created to carry forward an ever advancing civilization" proclaims 

Baha'u'llah,  and "The   

 purpose of the one true God, exalted be His glory, in revealing Himself unto men is to lay bare those gems that lie hidden within the mine of their true and inmost selves." 

 These aims of religion, universal and eternal, nevertheless have been conditioned to the capacities of each age or dispensation and the great religions of the past have developed their social orders within generally definable times and areas. Judaism, for instance, attained its peak under Solomon and was confined, before the dispersion, to the Near East; Zoroastrianism remained Persian until the Arab conquest and the settlement of a remnant in Western India; Christianity became the religion of European  civilization; the building of the nation state undertaken by Isliun remained a Muslim experiment until feudal Europe learned the lesson and its city states gave way to and adopted  the more advanced order. It has remained for the Baha'i religion to declare and promote the cause of world order — the sine qua non of its existence — and to disclose the concomitant unities of religion, of mankind and of historical purpose. 

 "Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been successively attempted and fully established. 

 World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity is striving. 

 Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. 

 A world, growing to maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human relationships,  and establish once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its life."1 Religion sees the course of history as an organic process, moving towards the full realization of all the potentialities implanted in man. The vicissitudes, the great advances, the hiatuses it regards as the natural unfoldment of that process just as the succession of bud, leaf, flower and fruit is the natural unfoldment in the life of a tree; or infancy, childhood, youth and maturity in that of a man. Indeed, Baha'i scripture explains, the process is the same. 

 The sun is the effective agent in the organic life of the earth; religion in that of humanity. 

 "The sun of truth is the Word of God, upon which depends the training of the people of the country of thought."2 The Creative Word, revealed in each stage of human progress by a Manifestation of God, and conditioned to the requirements of the time, is the effective agent in the long, single process of humanity's development from infancy to World Order. This truth is enshrined in all revealed religion although it needs the illumination of Baha'u'llah's revelation to enable men to perceive it. "The first picture presented in the Bible is that of human unity in its simplest form: that of a single family. The last picture is that of a unity manifold and universal in which all kindreds and tongues and peoples and nations are gathered into one and unified in the enjoyment of a common worship, a common happiness, a common glory. 

 "The great problem which, according to the Bible, confronts the human race in its progress is that of advancing from the barest, baldest unity through a long experience of multiplying

xxii                THE BAHA'I WORLD diversities till ultimately a balance between the two principles is struck, poise is gained and the two forces of variety and unity are blended in a multiple, highly developed world fellowship, the perfection of whose union was hardly suggested in the primitive simplicity of early mait' '1 This spiritual view of evolution is the constant theme of religion. Each revelation refers to the past, looks forward to the future and concentrates upon the immediate need for spiritual regeneration and enlightenment. The Prophet evokes in human hearts a sacrificial love which transcends self-interest and causes the early believers to dedicate themselves entirely to the practice and diffusion of the new message. As it spreads it works like leaven in society, reforming its morals, uplifting its vision and promoting a greater diffusion of love in social action. 

 "World history at its core and in its essence is the story of the spiritual evolution of mankind. From this all other activities of man proceed and round it all other activities revolve."2 Unlike the revelations of the past, the Baha'i revelation releases not only the Creative Word necessary to the renewal of spiritual vitality in the human spirit, but embodies that divine energy in an administrative order capable of bringing within its shade all the diversified ethnic groups and myriad types of the human race, who may find within its wide embrace a full, happy and purposeful life. 

 Baha activity therefore is directed not only, as in the past, to the spreading of the Word, but to the establishment of the fabric of that Order which, enshrined within the Creative Word itself, becomes  the chief instrument for the further diffusion and social application of the Divine Message. 

 This World Order, which the Baha Faith exists to establish, is none other than that long-promised Kingdom in which peace, justice and brotherhood shall prevail universally and "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."3 The establishment of this World Order is dependent upon the regeneration of mankind which must turn again to God and recognize His purpose. 

 The two aims of religion are, therefore, interacting and interdependent. 

 Such a world-shaking transformation cannot 

George Townshend, The      

 Heart of the Gospel, 1939. 2 ibid. flabakkuk 2:14 be brought about by any movement of reform, however disinterested, nor by any unaided human effort. 

 Modem man has turned away from God and, bereft of his traditional sanctions, has inevitably wrecked his old order which, in truth, is lamentably inadequate to modern conditions and is not susceptible of repair. "Soon", is Baha'u'llah's prophetic view of our day, "will the present day order be rolled i~p, anda new one spread out in its stead." Likewise,  "The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably deft ctive." 

 The current aim of religion, embodied in the aims and purposes of the Baha'i Faith, is the bringing to birth of the next stage in the organic process of human evolution, and may be regarded  as the coming of age of the human race. The outward sign of this maturity is the unification  of mankind and a federation of the world in a single all-embracing world society of human brotherhood. 

 It is envisaged in the following words from the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith in his essay The Unfoldment of World Civilization: "The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha'u'llah, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources  of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. 

 A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system. 

 A mechanism of world intercommunication  will be devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvel

INTRODUCTION              xxiii bus swiftness and perfect regularity. A world metropolis will act as the nerve centre of a world civilization, the focus towards which the unifying forces of life will converge and from which its energizing influences will radiate. 

 A world language will either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary to their mother tongue. A world script, a world literature, a uniform and universal system of currency, of weights and measures, will simplify and facilitate intercourse  and understanding among the nations and races of mankind. In such a world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces inhumanlife,will be reconciled, wilico-operate, and will harmoniously develop. 

 The press will, under such a system, while giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and convictions of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private  or public, and will be liberated from the influence of contending governments and peoples. The economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will be coordinated and developed, and the distribution  of its products will be equitably regulated. 

 "National rivalries, hatreds, and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity, understanding and cooperation. 

 The causes of religious strife will be permanently removed, economic barriers  and restrictions will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction between  classes will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear. 

 The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic or political, will be consecrated  to such ends as will extend the range of human inventions and technical development, to the increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising of the standard  of physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spirituallife of the entire human race. 

 "A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising unehallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the Last and West, liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation — such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving."

  x. THE PROCLAMATION OF BAHA'U'LLAH We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; yet they deem Us a stirrer up of sir We and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment.... 

 That all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled — what harm is there in this?.                 Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the 'Most Great Peace' shall come        Yet do We see your kings and rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the destruction of the human race than on that which would conduce to the happiness of mankind. 

 • These strffes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family... Let not a man glory in this, that lie loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his kind. 1 

      A. THE SUMMONS TO THE KINGS COLLECTIVELY

  O     KINGS of the earth! He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is come. The Kingdom is God's, the omnipotent Protector, the Self-Sub-sisting. 

 Worship none but God, and, with radiant hearts, lift up your faces unto your Lord, the Lord of all names. This is a Revelation  to which whatever ye possess can never be compared, could ye but know it. We see you rejoicing in that which ye have amassed from others, and shutting out yourselves from the worlds which naught except My Guarded Tablet can reckon. The treasures ye have laid up have drawn you far away from your ultimate objective. This ill beseemeth you, could ye but understand it. Wash your hearts from all earthly defilements, and hasten to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven, Who caused the worid to tremble, and all its peoples to wail, except them that have renounced  all things and clung to that which the Hidden Tablet hath ordained. 

 Spoken by flahg'u'1tTh as recorded by E. 0. 

 Browne, the orientalist, during the first of the four interviews which he was granted between April15 and 20, 1890. 
      O Kings of the earth!      

 The Most Great Law hath been revealed in this Spot, this Scene of transcendent splendour. Every hidden thing bath been brought to light, by virtue of the Will of the Supreme Ordainer, He Who hath ushered in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been cleft, and every irrevocable decree expounded. 

 Ye are but vassals, 0 Kings of the earth! He Who is the King of kings hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning you unto Himself, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. 

 Take heed lest pride deter you from recognizing the Source of Revelation; lest the things of this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is the Creator of heaven. 

 Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath created you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all time, the emblems of His sovereignty. 

 By the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your kingdoms. Our 1

 mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. 

 Upon them the eyes of Baha are fastened. To this testifieth the Kingdom of Names, could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his Lord, will renounce the world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, must be the detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station! Forsake your palaces, and haste ye to gain admittance into His Kingdom. This, indeed, will profit you both in this world and in the next. To this testifieth the Lord of the realm on high, did ye but know it. How great is the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Mel Such a king is numbered with the companions  of the Crimson Ark, the Ark which God hath prepared for the people of Bali All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent Protector  of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind,  the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, 0 people of RaM, your substance, nay your very lives, for his assistance. 

 We have asked nothing from you. For the sake of God We, verily, exhort you, and will be patient as We have been patient in that which hath befallen Us at your hands, 0 concourse of kings! 

  O     KINGS of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God, calling from this sublime, this fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill, upon the holy Plain, intoning the words: "There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise." ... Fear God, 0 concourse of kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most sublime  grace. Fling away, then, the things ye possess, and take fast hold on the Handle of God, the Exalted, the Great. 

 Set your hearts towards the Face of God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to follow, and be not of those who perish. 

 Relate unto them, 0 Servant, the story of 'All (the Bin), when lie came unto them with truth, bearing His glorious and weighty Book, and holding in His hands a testimony and proof from God, and holy and blessed tokens from Him. Ye, however, 0 Kings, have failed to heed the Remembrance of God in His days and to be guided by the lights which arose and shone forth above the horizon of a resplendent Heaven. 

 Ye examined not His Cause when so to do would have been better for you than all that the sun shineth upon, could ye but perceive it. Ye remained careless until the divines of 

Persia                     

 — those cruel ones — pronounced judgment against Him, and unjustly slew Him. 

 His spirit ascended unto God, and the eyes of the inmates of Paradise and the angels that are nigh unto Him wept sore by reason of this cruelty. 

 Beware that ye be not careless henceforth as ye have been careless aforetime. Return, then, unto God, your Maker, and be not of the heedless. 

 My face hath come forth from the veils, and shed its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye turned not towards Him, notwithstanding that ye were created for Him, o concourse of kings! Follow, therefore, that which I speak unto you, and hearken unto it with your hearts, and be not of such as have turned aside. For your glory consisteth not in your sovereignty, but rather in your nearness unto God and your observance of His command  as sent down in His holy and preserved Tablets. Should any one of you rule over the whole earth, and over all that lieth within it and upon it, its seas, its lands, its mountains, and its plains, and yet be not remembered by God, all these would profit him not, could ye but know it; ... Arise, then, and make steadfast your feet, and make ye amends for that which hath escaped you, and set then yourselves towards His holy Court, on the shore of His mighty Ocean, so that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, which God bath stored up within the shell of His radiant heart, may be revealed unto you. 

 Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of God from blowing over your hearts, the breeze through which the hearts of such as have turned unto Him can be quickened. ... 

 Beware not to deal unjustly with any one that appealeth to you, and entereth beneath your shadow. Walk ye in the fear of God, and be ye of them that lead a godly life. Rest not on your power, your armies, and treasures. Put your whole trust and confidence in God, Who hath created you, and seek ye His help in

  The house of Ri4d Big, one of the seven houses occupied by Baha'u'llah during the period He spent in Adrianople from December 12, 1863, to August 12, 1868. 

  all your affairs. Succour cometh from Him alone. 

 He succoureth whom He willeth with the hosts of the heavens and of the earth. 

 Know ye that the poor are the trust of God in your midst. Watch that ye betray not His trust, that ye deal not unjustly with them and that ye walk not in the ways of the treacherous. Ye will most certainly be called upon to answer for His trust on the day when the Balance of Justice shall be set, the day when unto every one shall be rendered his due, when the doings of all men, be they rich or poor, shall be weighed. 

 If ye pay no heed unto the counsels which, in peerless and unequivocal language, We have revealed in this Tablet, Divine chastisement shall assail you from every direction, and the sentence of His justice shall be pronounced against you. On that day ye shall have no power to resist Him, and shall recognize your own impotence. Have mercy on yourselves and on those beneath you, and judge ye between them according to the precepts prescribed by God in His most holy and exalted Tablet, a Tablet wherein He hath assigned to each and every thing its settled measure, in which He hath given, with distinctness, an explanation of all things, and which is in itself a monition unto them that believe in Him. 

 Examine Our Cause, inquire into the things that have befallen Us, and decide justly between Us and Our enemies, and be ye of them that act equitably towards their neighbours. 

 If ye stay not the hand of the oppressor, if ye fail to safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, what right have ye then to vaunt yourselves among men? 

 What is it of which ye can rightly boast? Is it on your food and your drink that ye pride yourselves, on the riches ye lay up in your treasuries, on the diversity and the cost of the ornaments with which ye deck yourselves? 

 If true glory were to consist in the possession of such perishable things, then the earth on which ye walk must needs vaunt itself over you, because it supplieth you, and bestoweth upon you, these very things, by the decree of the Almighty. In its bowels are contained, according to what God hath ordained, all that ye possess. From

 it, as a sign of His mercy, ye derive your riches. Behold then your state, the thing in which ye glory! 

 Would that ye could perceive it! Nay, by Him Who holdeth in His grasp the kingdom of the entire creation! 

 Nowhere doth your true and abiding glory reside except in your firm adherence unto the precepts of God, your wholehearted observance of His laws, your resolution to see that they do not remain unenforced,  and to pursue steadfastly the right course. 
...                        

 Twenty years have passed, 0 Kings, during which We have, each day, tasted the agony of a fresh tribulation. 

 No one of them that were before Us hath endured the things We~ have endured. Would that ye could perceive it! They that rose up against Us, have put Us to death, have shed Our blood, have plundered Our property, and violated Our honour. Though aware of most of Our afflictions, ye, nevertheless,  have failed to stay the hand of the aggressor.  For is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind? 

 God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, and punish the wrong doers. 

 If ye neglect the duty prescribed unto you by God in His Book, your names shall be numbered with those of the unjust in His sight. Grievous, indeed, will be your error. Cleave ye to that which your imaginations have devised, and cast behind your backs the commandments  of God, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible, the All-Compelling, the Almighty?  Cast away the things ye possess, and cling to that which God bath bidden you observe.  Seek ye His grace, for he that seeketh it treadeth His straight Path.... 

  0  KINGS of the earth! We see you increasing  every year your expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on your subjects. 

 This, verily, is wholly and grossly unjust. Fear the sighs and tears of this Wronged One, and lay not excessive burdens on your peoples. Do not rob them to rear palaces for yourselves; nay rather choose for them that which ye choose for yourselves. Thus We unfold to your eyes that which profiteth you, if ye but perceive. Your people are your treasures. Beware lest your rule violate the commandments of God, and ye deliver  your wards to the hands of the robber. 

 By them ye rule, by their means ye subsist, by their aid ye conquer. 

 Yet, how disdainfully ye look upon them! How strange, how very strange! 

 Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto this, the Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own condition and that of your dependents. 
     0 Rulers of the earth!     

 Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no more armaments  save in a measure to safeguard your territories and dominions. Beware lest ye disregard  the counsel of the All-Knowing, the Faithful. 

 Be united, 0 Kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you, and your people find rest, if ye be of them that comprehend. Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice. 

  'I' HE one true God, exalted be His glory, hat ever regarded, and will continue to regard, the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive possession. 

 All else, whether pertaining to land or sea, whether riches or glory, He hath bequeathed  unto the kings and rulers of the earth. From the beginning that bath no beginning the ensign proclaiming the words "He doeth whatsoever He willeth" hath been unfurled in all its splendour before His Manifestation. 

 What mankind needeth in this day is obedience unto them that are in authority, and a faithful adherence  to the cord of wisdom. The instruments which are essential to the immediate protection, the security and assurance of the human race have been entrusted to the hands, and lie in the grasp, of the governors of human society. This is the wish of God and His decree. 

 We  cherish  the hope that one of the kings of the earth will, for the sake of God, arise for the triumph of this wronged, this oppressed people. Such a king will be eternally extolled and glorified. God hat prescribed unto this people the duty of aiding whosoever will aid them, of serving

 his best interests, and of demonstrating to him their abiding loyalty. They who follow Me must strive, under all circumstances, to promote  the welfare of whosoever will arise for the triumph of My Cause, and must at all times prove their devotion and fidelity unto him. Happy is the man that hearkeneth and observ-eth  My counsel. 

 Woe unto him that faileth to fulfil My wish. 
                           
     To NAPOLEON III            

  KING of Paris! Tell the priest to ring the bells no longer. By God, the 

True One! The Most Mighty  

 Bell hath appeared in the form of Him Who is the Most Great Name, and the fingers of the will of Thy Lord, the 

Most Exalted, the Most     

 High, toll it out in the heaven of Immortality, in His name, the All-Glorious. Thus have the mighty verses of Thy Lord been again sent down unto thee, that thou mayest arise to remember God, the Creator of earth and heaven, in these days when all the tribes of the earth have mourned, and the foundations of the cities have trembled, and the dust of it-religion  hath enwrapped all men, except such as God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, was pleased to spare. Say: He Who is the Unconditioned is come, in the clouds of light, that He may quicken all created things with the breeze of His Name, the Most Merciful, and unify the world, and gather all men around this Table which hath been sent down from heaven. 

 Beware  that ye deny not the favour of God after it hath been sent down unto you. Better is this for you than that which ye possess; for that which is yours perisheth, whilst that which is with God endureth. He, in truth, ordaineth what He pleaseth. 

 Verily, the breezes of forgiveness  have been wafted from the direction of your Lord, the God of Mercy; whoso turneth thereunto, shall be cleansed of his sins, and of all pain and sickness. Happy the man that hath turned towards them, and woe betide him that hath turned aside. 

 Wert thou to incline thine inner ear unto all created things, thou wouldst hear: "The Ancient  of Days is come in His great glory!" Everything  celebrateth the praise of its Lord. 

Some                       

 have known God and remember Him; others remember Him, yet know Him not. Thus have We set down Our decree in a perspicuous Tablet. 

 Give ear, 0 King, unto the Voice that calleth from the Fire which burneth in this verdant Tree, on this Sinai which hath been raised above the hallowed and snow-white Spot, beyond  the Everlasting City: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful I" We, in truth, have sent Him Whom We aided with the Holy 

Spirit (Jesus Christ)      

 that He may announce unto you this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and Whose signs have been revealed  in the West. Set your faces towards Him (Baha'u'llah) on this Day which God hath exalted  above all other days, and whereon the All-Merciful  hath shed the splendour of His effulgent  glory upon all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. 

 Arise thou to serve God and help His Cause. He, verily, will assist thee with the hosts of the seen and unseen, and will set thee king over all that whereon the sun riseth. Thy Lord, in truth, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. 

 The breezes of the Most Merciful have passed over all created things; happy the man that hath discovered their fragrance, and set himself towards  them with a sound heart. Attire thy temple with the ornament of My Name, and thy tongue with remembrance of Me, and thine heart with love for Me, the Almighty, the Most High. We have desired for thee naught except that which is better for thee than what thou dost possess and all the treasures of the earth. 

 Thy Lord, verily, is knowing, informed of all. 

 Arise, in My Name, amongst My servants,  and say: "0 ye peoples of the earth! Turn yourselves towards Him Who hath turned towards you. He, verily, is the Face of God amongst you, and His Testimony and His Guide unto you. He hath come to you with signs which none can produce." The voice of the Burning Bush is raised in the midmost heart of the world, and the Holy Spirit calleth aloud among the nations: 

"Lo, the Desired One       

 is come with manifest dominion!" 

 0 King! The stars of the heaven of knowledge  have fallen, they who seek to establish the truth of My Cause through the things they possess, and who make mention of God in My

 Name. And yet, when I came unto them in My glory, they turned aside. They, indeed, are of the fallen. 

 This is, truly, that which the Spirit of God (Jesus Christ) bath announced, when He came with truth unto you, He with Whom the Jewish doctors disputed, till at last they perpetrated what bath made the Holy Spirit to lament, and the tears of them that have near access to God to flow. 

 0     King! We heard the words thou didst utter in answer to the Czar of Russia, concerning  the decision made regarding the war (Cri-mean  War). Thy Lord, verily, knoweth, is informed of all. Thou didst say: "I lay asleep upon my couch, when the cry of the oppressed, who were drowned in the Black Sea, wakened me." This is what we heard thee say, and, verily, thy Lord is witness unto what I say. We testify that that which wakened thee was not their cry but the promptings of thine own passions, for We tested thee, and found thee wanting. Comprehend the meaning of My words, and be thou of the discerning. 

 It is not Our wish to address thee words of condemnation,  out of regard for the dignity We conferred  upon thee in this mortal life. 

 We, verily, have chosen courtesy, and made it the true mark of such as are nigh unto Him. 

 Courtesy, is, in truth, a raiment which fitteth all men, whether young or oki. Well is it with him that adorneth his temple therewith, and woe unto him who is deprived of this great bounty. 

 Hadst thou been sincere in thy words, thou wouldst have not cast behind thy back the Book of God, when it was sent unto thee by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise. We have proved thee through it, and found thee other than that which thou didst profess. Arise, and make amends for that which escaped thee, lire long the world and all that thou possessest will perish, and the kingdom will remain unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy fathers of old. It behoveth thee not to conduct thine affairs according to the dictates of thy desires. 

 Fear the sighs of this Wronged One, and shield Him from the darts of such as act unjustly. 

 For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown into confusion, and thine empire shall pass from thine hands, as a punishment for that which thou hast wrought. Then wilt thou know how thou hast plainly erred. Commotions  shall seize all the people in that land, unless thou arisest to help this Cause, and followest Him Who is the 

Spirit of God (Jesus Christ)

 in this, the Straight Path. ilath thy pomp made thee proud? By My Life! 

 It shall not endure; nay, it shall soon pass away, unless thou lioldest fast by this firm Cord. We see abasement hastening after thee, whilst thou art of the heedless. It behoveth thee when thou hearest His Voice calling from the seat of glory to cast away all that thou possessest, and cry out: "Here am I, 0 Lord of all that is in heaven and all that is on earth!" 

 0 King! We were in 'Jitq, when the hour of patting arrived. At the bidding of the King of Is1~m (SultAn of Turkey) We set Our steps in his direction.

 Know of a truth that your subjects are God's trust amongst you. Watch ye, therefore, over them as ye watch over your own selves. Beware that ye allow not wolves to become the shepherds  of the fold, or pride and conceit to deter you from turning unto the poor and the desolate.  Arise thou, in My name, above the horizon of renunciation, and set, then, thy face towards the Kingdom, at the bidding of thy Lord, the Lord of strength and of might. 

 Adorn the body of thy kingdom with the raiment of My name, and arise, then, to teach My Cause. 

 Better is this for thee than that which thou possessest. 

 God will, thereby, exalt thy name among all the kings. Potent is He over all things. Walk thou amongst men in the name of God, and by the power of His might, that thou mayest show forth His signs amidst the peoples of the earth. 

 Regard ye the world as a man's body, which is afflicted with divers ailments, and the recovery of which dependeth upon the harmonizing of all of its component elements. 

 Gather ye around that which We have prescribed unto you, and walk not in the ways of such as create dissension. Meditate on the world and the state of its people. He, for Whose sake the world was called into being, hath been imprisoned in the

 From the horizon of His prison-city He summoneth mankind unto the Dayspring of God, the Exalted, the Great. Exultest thou over the treasures thou dost possess, knowing they shall perish? Rejoicest thou in that thou rulest a span of earth, when the whole world, in the estimation of the people of Bah6, is worth as much as the black in the eye of a dead ant? Abandon it unto such as have set their affections upon it, and turn thou unto Him Who is the Desire of the world. Whither are gone the proud and their palaces? Gaze thou into their tombs, that thou mayest profit by this example, inasmuch as We made it a lesson unto every beholder.

 thine ear unto the voice of God, the King, the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who, among the Concourse on high, bear-eth  the most excellent titles, and Who, in the kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the All-Glorious. 

 Beware lest thy desire deter thee from turning towards the face of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful. We, verily, have heard the thing for which thou didst supplicate thy Lord, whilst secretly communing with Him. Wherefore,  the breeze of My lovingkindness wafted forth, and the sea of My mercy surged, and We answered thee in truth. Thy Lord, verily, is the MI-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whilst I lay chained and fettered in the prison, one of thy ministers extended Me his aid. Wherefore hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of none can comprehend except His knowledge. Beware lest thou barter away this sublime station.. Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is the Supreme Sovereign. 

 He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, and all the atoms cry aloud: "Lo! The Lord is come in His great majesty!" He Who is the Father is come, and the Son (Jesus), in the holy vale, crieth out: "1-lere am I, here am I, 0 Lord, My God!" 

 whilst Sinai circieth round the House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: "The All-Bounteous is come mounted upon the clouds! Blessed is he that draweth nigh unto Him, and woe betide them that are far away." 

 Arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling Cause, and summon, then, the nations unto God, the Exalted, the Great. 

 Be thou not of them who called upon God by one of His names, but who, when He Who is the Object of all names appeared, denied Him and turned aside from Him, and, in the end, pronounced  sentence against Him with manifest injustice. 

 Consider and call thou to mind the days whereon the Spirit of God (Jesus) appeared,  and Herod gave judgment against Him. God, however, aided Hun with the hosts of the unseen, and protected Him with truth, and sent Him down unto another land, according to His promise. He, verily, ordaineth what He pleaseth. 

 Thy Lord truly preserveth whom He willeth, belie in the midst of the seas, or in the maw of the serpent, or beneath the sword of the oppressor.... 

 Again I say: Hearken unto My Voice that calleth from My prison that it may acquaint thee with the things that have befallen My Beauty, at the hands of them that are the manifestations of My glory, and that thou mayest perceive how great hath been My patience, notwithstanding  My might, and how immense My forbearance, notwithstanding My power. 

 By My Life! Couldst thou but know the things sent down by My Pen, and discover the trea-sires  of My Cause, and the pearls of My mysteries which lie hid in the seas of My names and in the goblets of My words, thou wouldst, in thy love for My name, and in thy longing for My glorious and sublime Kingdom, lay down thy life in My path. Know thou that though My body be beneath the swords of My foes, and My limbs be beset with incalculable afflictions, yet My spirit is ifiled with a gladness with which all the joys of the earth can never compare. 

 Set thine heart towards Him Who is the Point of adoration for the world, and say: 0 peoples of the earth! Have ye denied the One in Whose path He Who came with the truth, bearing the C

Cast away all that is on earth, and attire the head of thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. He, in truth, bath come unto the world in His most great glory, and all that hath been mentioned in the Gospel hath been fuiffiled. The land of Syria hath been honoured by the footsteps  of its Lord, the Lord of all men, and North and South are both inebriated with the wine of His presence. 

 Blessed is the man that inhaled the fragrance of the Most Merciful, and turned unto the Dawning-Place of His Beauty, in this resplendent 

Dawn. The Mosque of Aqs~

 Lay aside thy desire, and set then thine heart towards thy Lord, the Ancient of Days. We make mention of thee for the sake of God, and desire that thy name may be exalted through thy remembrance of God, the Creator of earth and heaven. He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. We have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous Revelation. 

 God bath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this. He, verily, will pay the doer of good his due recompense, wert thou to follow what hath been sent unto thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. As to him who turneth aside, and swelleth with pride, after that the clear tokens have come unto him, from the Revealer of signs, his work shall God bring to naught. He, in truth, hath power over all things. 

 Man's actions are acceptable after his having recognized (the Manifestation). 

 He that turneth aside from the True One is indeed the most veiled amongst His creatures. 

 Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Almighty, the

Thou art truly the Lord of the worlds and of those who show mercy the Most Merciful.  Assist me, then, 0 my God, to remember Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to aid Thy Cause in Thy lands.

  O   KING of Berlin! Give ear unto the Voice calling from this manifest Temple: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Everlasting, the Peerless, the Ancient of Days. Take heed lest pride debar thee from recognizing the Dayspring  of Divine Revelation, lest earthly desires shut thee out, as by a veil, from the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth below. 

 Thus counselleth thee the Pen of the Most High. 

 He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Do thou remember the one whose power transcended thy power (Napoleon III), and whose station excelled thy station. Where is he? Whither are gone the things he possessed? Take warning and be not of them that are fast asleep. He it was who cast the Tablet of God behind him, when We made known unto him what the hosts of tyranny had caused Us to suffer. 

 Wherefore, fore, disgrace assailed him from all sides, and he went down to dust in great loss. Think deeply, 0 King, concerning him, and concerning them who, like unto thee, have conquered cities and ruled over men. 

 The All-Merciful brought them down from their palaces to their graves. Be warned, be of them who reflect..

 who is the Dayspring of God's Light dwelt in the prison of 'Akka, at the time when thou didst set forth to visit the Aq~A Mosque (Jerusalem). Thou passed Him by, and inquired not about Him, by Whom every house is exalted, and every lofty gate unlocked. 

 We, verily, made it (Jeru-salem) a place whereunto the world should turn, that they might remember Me, and yet thou hast rejected Him Who is the Object of this remembrance, when He appeared with the Kingdom of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We have been with thee at all times, and found thee clinging unto the Branch and heedless  of the Root. 

 Thy Lord, verily, is a witness unto what I say. 

 We grieved to see thee circle round Our Name, whilst unaware of Us, though We were before thy face. 

 Open thine eyes, that thou mayest behold this glorious Vision, and recognize Him Whom thou invok-est  in the daytime and in the night season, and gaze on the Light that shineth above this luminous

 hath chosen to bestow upon thee, Him Who unerringly treadeth the straight Path. He it is Who summonetli thee unto God, thy Lord, Who showeth thee the right course, the way that leadeth to true felicity, that haply thou mayest be of them with whom it shall be well. 

 Beware, 0 King, that thou gather not around thee such ministers as follow the desires of a corrupt inclination, as have cast behind their backs that which hath been committed into their hands and manifestly betrayed their trust. Be bounteous to others as God bath been bounteous to thee, and abandon not the interests of thy people to the mercy of such ministers as these. Lay not aside the fear of God, and be thou of them that act uprightly. Gather around thee those ministers from whom thou canst perceive the fragrance of faith and of justice, and take thou counsel with them, and choose whatever is best in thy sight, and be of them that act generously. 

 Know thou for a certainty that whoso dis-believeth in God is neither trustworthy nor truthful. This, indeed, is the truth, the undoubted truth. lie that acteth treacherously towards God will, also, act treacherously towards his king. Nothing whatever can deter such a man from evil, nothing can hinder him from betraying his neighbour, nothing can induce him to walk uprightly. 

 Take heed that thou resign not the reins of the affairs of thy state into the hands of others, and repose not thy confidence in ministers unworthy  of thy trust, and be not of them that live in heedlessness. 

 Shun them whose hearts are turned away from thee, and place not thy confidence in them, and entrust them not with thy affairs and the affairs of such as profess thy faith. 

 Beware that thou allow not the wolf to become the shepherd of God's flock, and surrender not the fate of His loved ones to the mercy of the malicious. Expect not that they who violate the ordinances of God will be trustworthy  or sincere in the faith they profess. Avoid them, and preserve strict guard over thyself, lest their devices and mischief hurt thee. Turn away from them, and fix thy gaze upon God, thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful. 

 lie that giveth up himself wholly to God, God shall, assuredly, be with him; and he that placeth his complete trust in God, God shall, verily, protect him from whatsoever may harm him, and shield him from the wickedness of every evil plotter. 

 Wert thou to incline thine ear unto My speech and observe My counsel, God would exalt thee to so eminent a position that the designs  of no man on the whole earth could ever touch or hurt thee. 

 Observe, 0 King, with thine inmost heart and with thy whole being, the precepts  of God, and walk not in the paths of the oppressor. Seize thou, and hold firmly within the grasp of thy might, the reins of the affairs of thy people, and examine in person whatever pertaineth unto them. Let nothing escape thee, for therein lieth the highest good. 

 Render thanks unto God for having chosen thee out of the whole world, and made thee king over them that profess thy faith. It well beseemeth thee to appreciate the wondrous favours with which God hath favoured thee, and to magnify continually His name. Thou canst best praise Him if thou lovest His loved ones, and dost safeguard and protect His servants  from the mischief of the treacherous, that none may any longer oppress them. Thou shouldst, moreover, arise to enforce the law of God amongst them, that thou mayest be of those who are firmly established in His law. 

 Shouldst thou cause rivers of justice to spread their waters amongst thy subjects, God would surely aid thee with the hosts of the unseen and of the seen and would strengthen thee in thine affairs. 
No God is there but Him.   

 All creation and its empire are His. Unto Him return the works of the faithful. 

 Place not thy reliance on thy treasures. Put thy whole confidence in the grace of God, thy Lord. 

 Let Him be thy trust in whatever thou doest, and be of them that have submitted themselves to His Will. Let Him be thy helper and enrich thyself with His treasures, for with Him are the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth. He bestoweth them upon whom He will, and from whom He will He withlioldeth them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Possessing, the Mi-Praised. All are but paupers at the door of His mercy; all are helpless before the revelation of His sovereignty, and beseech His favours. 

 Overstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly with them that serve thee. Bestow upon them according to their needs and not to the extent that will enable them to lay up riches

  for themselves, to deck their persons, to embellish their homes, to acquire the things that are of no benefit unto them, and to be numbered with the extravagant. Deal with them with undeviating justice, so that none among them may either suffer want, or be pampered with luxuries.  This is but manifest justice. 

 Allow not the abject to rule over and dominate them who are noble and worthy of honour, and suffer not the high-minded to be at the mercy of the contemptible and worthless, for this is what We observed upon Our arrival in the City (Constantinople), and to it We bear witness. 

 We found among its inhabitants some who were possessed of an affluent fortune and lived in the midst of excessive riches, whilst others were in dire want and abject poverty. This ill beseemeth thy sovereignty, and is unworthy  of thy rank. 

 Let My counsel be acceptable to thee, and strive thou to rule with equity among men, that God may exalt thy name and spread abroad the fame of thy justice in all the world. Beware lest thou aggrandize thy ministers at the expense of thy subjects. Fear the sighs of the poor and of the upright in heart who, at every break of day, bewail their plight, and be unto them a benignant sovereign. They, verily, are thy treasures on earth. 

 It behoveth thee, therefore, to safeguard  thy treasures from the assaults of them who wish to rob thee. 

 Inquire into their affairs, and ascertain, every year, nay every month, their condition, and be not of them that are careless of their duty. 

 Set before thine eyes God's unerring Balance and, as one standing in His Presence, weigh in that Balance thine actions every day, every moment of thy life. Bring thyself to account ere thou art summoned to a reckoning, on the Day when no man shall have strength to stand for fear of God, the Day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall be made to tremble. 

 It behoveth every king to be as bountiful as the sun, which fostereth the growth of all beings, and giveth to each its due, whose benefits are not inherent in itself, but are ordained by Him Who is the Most Powerful, the Almighty. The king should be as generous, as liberal in his mercy as the clouds, the outpourings of whose bounty are showered upon every land, by the

 behest of Him Who is the Supreme Ordainer, the 

All-Knowing.               

 Have a care not to entrust thine. affairs of state entirely into another's hands. None can discharge thy functions better than thine own self. Thus do We make clear unto thee Our words of wisdom, and send down upon thee that which can enable thee to pass over from the left hand of oppression to the right hand of justice, and approach the resplendent ocean of His favours. 

 Such is the path which the kings that were before thee have trodden, they that acted equitably towards their subjects, and walked in the ways of undeviating justice. 

 Thou art God's shadow on earth. Strive, therefore, to act in such a manner as befitteth so emfnent, so august a station. 

 If thou dost depart  from following the things We have caused to descend upon thee and taught thee, thou wilt, assuredly, be derogating from that great and priceless honour. 

 Return, then, and cleave wholly unto God, and cleanse thine heart from the world and all its vanities, and suffer not the love of any stranger to enter and dwell therein. Not until thou dost purify thine heart from every trace of such love can the brightness of the light of God shed its radiance upon it, for to none bath God given more than one heart. This, verily, hath been decreed and written down in His ancient Book. And as the human heart, as fashioned by God, is one and undivided, it behoveth thee to take heed that its affections be, also, one and undividecL Cleave thou, therefore, with the whole affection of thine heart, unto His love, and withdraw it from the love of any one besides Him, that He may aid thee to immerse thyself in the ocean of His unity, and enable thee to become a true upholder of His oneness. God is My witness. My sole purpose in revealing to thee these words is to sanctify thee from the transitory things of the earth, and aid thee to enter the realm of everlasting glory, that thou mayest, by the leave of God, be of them that abide and rule therein. 
...                        

 Let thine ear be attentive, 0 King, to the words We have addressed to thee. 

 Let the oppressor desist from his tyranny, and cut off the perpetrators of injustice from among them that profess thy faith. By the righteousness of God! The tribulations We have sustained are such that any pen that recounteth them cannot but be overwhelmed with anguish. No one of them that truly believe and uphold the unity of God can bear the burden of their recital. So great have been Our sufferings that even the eyes of Our enemies have wept over Us, and beyond them those of every discerning person. And to all these trials have We been subjected, in spite of Our action in approaching thee, and in bidding the people to enter beneath thy shadow, that thou mightest be a stronghold unto them that believe in and uphold the unity of God. 

 Have I, 0 King, ever disobeyed thee? Have I, at any time, transgressed any of thy laws? Can any of thy ministers that represented thee in 'Ir&q produce any proof that can establish my disloyalty to thee? No, by Him Who is the Lord of all worlds! 

 Not for one short moment did We rebel against thee, or against any of thy ministers. 

 Never, God willing, shall We revolt against thee, though We be exposed to trials more severe than any We suffered in the past. 

 In the day time and in the night season, at even and at morn, We pray to God on thy behalf, that He may graciously aid thee to be obedient unto Him and to observe His commandment,  that He may shield thee from the hosts of the evil ones. Do, therefore, as it pleaseth thee, and treat Us as befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy sovereignty. Be not forgetful of the law of God in whatever thou desirest to achieve, now or in the days to come. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!

This thing is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow.

 will of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Mi-Praised, have stirred. Can it be still when the tempestuous winds are blowing? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all Names and Attributes! 
They move it as they list.

 The evanescent is as nothing before Him Who is the Ever-Abiding. 

 His all-compelling  summons bath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise amidst all people. I was indeed as one dead when His behest  was uttered. 

 The hand of the will of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful, transformed Me. Can any one speak forth of his own accord that for which all men, both high and low, will protest against him? 

 Nay, by Him Who taught the Pen the eternal mysteries, save him whom the grace of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, bath strengthened. The Pen of the Most High addresseth Me saying: Fear not. Relate unto His Majesty the Shah that which befell thee. His heart, verily, is between the fingers of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, that haply the sun of justice and bounty may shine forth above the horizon of his heart. 

 Thus hath the decree been irrevocably fixed by Him Who is the MI-Wise. 

 Look upon this Youth, 0 King, with the eyes of justice; judge thou, then, with truth concerning what hath befallen Him. 

 Of a verity, God hath made thee His shadow amongst men, and the sign of His power unto all that dwell on earth. Judge thou between Us and them that have wronged Us without proof and without an enlightening Book. They that surround thee love thee for their own sakes, whereas this Youth loveth thee for thine own sake, and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of grace, and to turn thee toward the right-hand of justice. Thy Lord beareth witness unto that which I declare. 

 0 King! Wert thou to incline thine ear unto the shrill of the Pen of Glory and the cooing of the Dove of Eternity which, on the branches of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, uttereth praises to God, the Maker of all names and Creator of earth and heaven, thou wouldst attain unto a station from which thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught save the effulgence of the Adored One, and wouldst regard thy sovereignty as the most contemptible  of thy possessions, abandoning it to whosoever  might desire it, and setting thy face toward  the Horizon aglow with the light of His countenance. Neither wouldst thou ever be willing to bear the burden of dominion save for the purpose of helping thy Lord, the Exalted, the Most High. Then would the Concourse on high bless thee. 0 how excellent is this most sublime station, couldst thou ascend thereunto through the power of a sovereignty recognized as derived from the Name of God! 

 0 King of the age! The eyes of these refugees are turned towards and fixed upon the mercy of the Most Merciful. No doubt is there whatever that these tribulations will be followed by the outpourings of a supreme mercy, and these dire adversities be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity. 

 We fain would hope, however, that His Majesty the Sh6h will himself examine these matters, and bring hope to the hearts. That which We have submitted to thy Majesty is indeed for thine highest good. 

 And God, verily, is a sufficient witness unto Me. ... 

 o would that thou wouldst permit Mc, 0 $hAh, to send unto thee that which would cheer the eyes, and tranquillize the squls, and persuade  every fair-minded person that with Him is the knowledge of the Book. But for the repudiation of the foolish and the connivance of the divines, I would have uttered a discourse that would have thrilled and carried away the hearts unto a realm from the murmur of whose winds can be heard: "No God is there but He!"... 

 I have seen 0 ShAh, in the path of God what eye bath not seen nor ear heard.. How numerous the tribulations which have rained, and will soon rain, upon Me! I advance with My face set towards Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Bounteous,  whilst behind Me glideth the serpent.  Mine eyes have rained down tears until My bed is drenched. I sorrow not for Myself, however. 

 By God! Mine head yearneth for the spear out of love for its Lord. I never passed a tree, but Mine heart addressed it saying: "0 would that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee, in the path of My 

Lord!". By God! Though    

 weariness lay Me low, and hunger consume Me, and the bare rock be My bed, and My fellows the beasts of the field, I will not complain, but will endure patiently as those endued with constancy and firmness have endured patiently, through the power of God, the Eternal King and Creator of the nations, and will render thanks unto God under all conditions. 

 We pray that, out of His bounty — exalted be He — He may release,

 though this imprisonment, the necks of men from chains and fetters, and cause them to turn, with sincere faces, towards His Face, Who is the Mighty, the Bounteous. Ready is He to answer whosoever calleth upon Him, and nigh is 1-le unto such as commune with Him. 
                          
     To THE RULERS OF          
         AMERICA                   
                          
LI EARKEN ye, 0 Rulers    

 of America and the Presidents of the Republics therein, unto that which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of Eternity: There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Abiding, the Forgiving, the All-Boun-tiful.  Adorn ye the temple of dominion with the ornament of justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus counselleth you He Who is the Dayspring of Names, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Promised One hath appeared in this glorified Station, whereat all beings, both seen and unseen, have rejoiced. Take ye advantage of the Day of God. Verily, to meet Him is better for you than all that whereon the sun shineth, could ye but know it. o concourse of rulers! Give ear unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur:  Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of Utterance, the Mi-Knowing. Bind ye the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. 

      To THE ELECTED            
  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE    
   PEOPLE IN EVERY LAND      

  (])YE the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel together, and let your concern be oniy for that which profiteth mankind, and bettereth the condition thereof, if ye be of them that scan heedfully. 

 Regard the world as the human body which, though at its creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay its sickness waxed more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians, who gave full rein to their personal desires, and have erred grievously. And if, at one time, through the care of an able physician, a member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before. 

 Thus informeth you the MI-Knowing, the Mi-Wise. 

 We behold it, in this day, at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage, much less recognize a Revelation so bewildering and challenging as this. 

 And whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its condition, his motive hath been his own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the unworthiness of this motive hath limited his power to heal or cure. 

 That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician. This, verily, is the truth, and all else naught but error.... 
                          
        B. TO THE WORLD'S RELIGIOUS LEADERS

 over you, inasmuch as ye have failed to recognize the One upon Whom ye have been calling in the day time and in the night season, at even and at morn. Advance, 0 people, with snow-white  faces and radiant hearts, unto the blest and crimson Spot, wherein the Sadratu'1-MuntaM is calling: "Verily, there is none other God beside Me, the Omnipotent 

Protector, the Self-Subsisting!"
    0 ye leaders of religion! 

 Who is the man amongst you that can rival Me in vision or insight? 

 Where is he to be found that dareth to claim to be My equal in utterance or wisdom? No, by My Lord, the All-Merciful! All on the earth shall pass away; and this is the face of your Lord, the Almighty, the Well-Beloved. 

 We have decreed, 0 people, that the highest and last end of all learning be the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge; and yet, behold how ye have allowed your learning to shut you out, as by a veil, from Him Who is the Dayspring of this Light, through Whom every hidden thing hath been revealed. Could ye but discover the source whence the splendour of this utterance is diffused, ye would cast away the peoples of the world and all that they possess, and would draw nigh unto this most blessed Seat of glory. 

 Say: This, verily, is the heaven in which the Mother Book is treasured, could ye but comprehend  it. He it is Who hath caused the Rock to shout, and the Burning Bush to lift up its voice, upon the Mount rising above the Holy Land, and proclaim: "The Kingdom is God's, the sovereign Lord of all, the All-Powerful, the Loving!" 

 We have not entered any school, nor read any of your dissertations. Incline your ears to the words of this unlettered One, wherewith He summoneth you unto God, the Ever-Abiding. Better is this for you than all the treasures of the earth, could ye but comprehend it. o     CONCOURSE of divines! 

 When My verses were sent down, and My clear tokens were revealed, We found you behind the veils. This, verily, is a strange thing.. We have rent the veils asunder. Beware lest ye shut out the people by yet another veil. 

 Pluck asunder the chains of vain imaginings, in the name of the Lord of all men, and be not of the deceitful. Should ye turn unto God, and embrace Ills Cause, spread not disorder within it, and measure not the Book of God with your selfish desires. 

 This, verily, is the counsel of God aforetime and hereafter. ... Had ye believed in God, when He revealed Himself, the people would not have turned aside from Him, nor would the things ye witness today have befallen Us. Fear God, and be not of the heedless.... This is the Cause that hath caused all your superstitions and idols to tremble. 
0 concourse  of divines! 

 Beware lest ye be the cause of strife in the land, even as ye were the cause of the repudiation of the Faith in its early days. Gather the people wound this Word that hath made the pebbles to cry out: "The Kingdom is God's, the Dawning-Place of all signs!" 

 Tear the veils asunder in such wise that the inmates  of the Kingdom will hear them being rent. 

 This is the command of God, in days gone by, and for those to come. 

 Blessed the man that observeth that whereunto he was bidden, and woe betide the negligent. 

  ow long will ye, o concourse of divines, level the spears of hatred at the face of RaM? Rein in your pens. Lo, the Most Sublime Pen speaketh betwixt earth and heaven. Fear God, and follow not your desires which have altered the face of creation. Purify your ears that they may hearken unto the Voice of God. By God! It is even as fire that consumeth the veils, and as water that washeth the souls of all who are in the universe. 

  o CONCOURSE of divines! 

 Can any one of you race with the Divine Youth in the arena of wisdom and utterance, or soar with Him into the heaven of inner meaning and explanation? Nay, by My Lord, the God of mercy! 

 All have swooned away in this Day from the Word of thy Lord. They are even as dead and lifeless, except him whom thy Lord, the Almighty, the Unconstrained, hath willed to exempt. Such a one is indeed of those endued with knowledge in the sight of Him Who is the All-Knowing. The inmates of Paradise, and the dwellers of the sacred Folds, bless him at eventide and at dawn. Can the one possessed of wooden legs resist him whose feet God hath made of steel? Nay, by Him Who illumineth the whole of creation!

16                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 WHEN We observed carefully, We discovered  that Our enemies are, for the most part, the divines. 

 Among the people are those who said: He bath repudiated the divines. 

Say:                      

 Yea, by My Lord! I, in very truth, was the One Who abolished the idols! 

 We, verily, have sounded the Trumpet, which is Our Most Sublime Pen, and lo, the divines and the learned, and the doctors and the rulers, swooned away except such as God preserved, as a token of His grace, and He, verily, is the All-Bounteous, the Ancient of Days... 
    0     concourse of divines!

 Fling away idle fancies and imaginings, and turn, then, towards the Horizon of Certitude. I swear by God! All that ye possess will profit you not, neither all the treasures of the earth, nor the leadership ye have usurped. 

 Fear God, and be not of the lost ones.. Say: 0 concourse of divines! 

 Lay aside all your veils and coverings. Give ear unto that whereunto calleth you the Most Sublime Pen, in this wondrous Day... The world is laden with dust, by reason of your vain imaginings, and the hearts of such as enjoy near access to God are troubled because of your cruelty. Fear God, and be of them that judge equitably. 

  O YE the dawning-places ofknowledge! Beware  that ye suffer not yourselves to become changed, for as ye change, most men will, likewise,  change. 

 This verily, is an injustice unto yourselves and unto others... Ye are even as a spring. If it be changed, so will the streams that branch out from it be changed. Fear God, and be numbered with the godly. In like manner, if the heart of man be corrupted, his limbs will also be corrupted. 

 And similarly, if the root of a tree be corrupted, its branches, and its offshoots,  and its leaves, and its fruits, will be corrupted.... 
  o concourse of divines!   

 Be fair, I adjure you by God, and nullify not the Truth with the things ye possess. Peruse that which We have sent down with truth. It will, verily, aid you, and will draw you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Great. 

 Consider and call to mind how when Mubanmmd, the Apostle of God, appeared, the people denied }-Iim. 

 They ascribed unto Him what caused the Spirit (Jesus) to lament in His Most Sublime Station, and the Faithful Spirit to cry out. Consider, moreover, the things which befell the Apostles and 

Messen                    

 gers of God before Him, by reason of what the hands of the unjust have wrought. 

 We make mention of you for the sake of God, andremind you of His signs, and announce unto you the things ordained for such as are nigh unto Him in the most sublime Paradise and the all-highest Heaven, and I, verily, am the Announcer, the Omniscient. 

 lie bath come for your salvation, and bath borne tribulations that ye may ascend, by the ladder of utterance, unto the summit of understanding... 

 Peruse, with fairness and justice, that which bath been sent down. 

 It will, verily, exalt you though the truth, and will cause you to behold the things from which ye have been withheld, and will enable you to quaff 

His sparkling Wine.       

  THOSE divines.. who are truly adorned with the ornament of knowledge and of a goodly  character are, verily, as a head to the body of the world, and as eyes to the nations. 

 The guidance of men hath, at all times, been and is dependent upon these blessed souls. 

  iPHE divine whose conduct is upright, and the sage who is just, are as the spirit unto the body of the world. Well is it with that divine whose head is attired with the crown of justice, and whose temple is adorned with the ornament of equity. 

  THE divine who hath seized and quaffed the most holy Wine, in the name of the sovereign Ordainer, is as an eye unto the world. Well is it with them who obey him, and call him to remembrance. 

  GREAT is the blessedness of that divine that hath not allowed knowledge to become a veil between him and the One Who is the Object of all knowledge, and who, when the Self-Subsist-ing appeared, hath turned with a beaming face towards Him. He, in truth, is numbered with the learned. 

 The inmates of Paradise seek the blessing of his breath, and his lamp sheddeth its radiance over all who are in heaven and on earth. He, verily, is numbered with the inheritors  of the Prophets. 
He that beholdeth him

WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH         17

 hath, verily, beheld the True One, and he that turneth towards him hath, verily, turned towards  God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. 

  O    CONCOURSE of divines! 

 Ye shall not henceforth behold yourselves possessed of any power, inasmuch as We have seized it from you, and destined it for such as have believed in God, the One, the MI-Powerful, the Almighty, the Unconstrained. 
                           
     To POPE PIUS IX            

  O     POPE! Rend the veils asunder. He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed with clouds, and the decree hath been fuiffiled by God, the Almighty, the Unrestrained... 

 He, verily, hath again come down from Heaven even as He came down from it the first time. Beware that thou dispute not with Him even as the Pharisees disputed with Him (Jesus) without  a clear token or proof On His right hand flow the living waters of grace, and on His left the choice Wine of justice, whilst before Him march the angels of Paradise, bearing the banners of His signs. Beware lest any name debar thee from God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Leave thou the world behind thee, and turn towards thy Lord, through Whom the whole earth hath been illumined. Dwellest thou in palaces whilst He Who is the King of Revelation liveth in the most desolate of abodes? Leave them unto such as desire them, and set thy face with joy and delight towards the Kingdom... 

 Arise in the name of thy Lord, the God of Mercy, amidst the peoples of the earth, and seize thou the Cup of Life with the hands of confidence, and first drink thou therefrom,  and proffer it then to such as turn towards  it amongst the peoples of all faiths... 

 Call thou to remembrance Him Who was the Spirit 

(Jesus), Who when He       

 came, the most learned of His age pronounced judgment against Him in His own country, whilst he who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take heed, then, ye men of understanding heart! Thou, in truth, art one of the suns of the heaven of His names. 

 Guard thyself, lest darkness spread its veils over thee, and fold thee away from His light. Consider those who opposed the Son (Jesus), when He came unto them with sovereignty and power. 

 How many the Pharisees who were waiting to behold Him, and were lamenting over their separation from Him! And yet, when the fragrance of His coming was wafted over them, and His beauty was unveiled, they turned aside from Him and disputed with Him. None save a very few, who were destitute of any power amongst men, turned towards  His face. And yet, today, every man endowed  with power and invested with sovereignty  prideth himself on His Name! In like manner,  consider how numerous, in these days, are the monks who, in My Name, have secluded themselves in their churches, and who, when the appointed time was fuiffiled, and We unveiled  Our beauty, knew Us not, though they call upon Me at eventide and at dawn. 

 The Word which the Son concealed is made manifest. 

 It hath been sent down in the form of the human temple in this day. Blessed be the Lord Who is the Father! He, verily, is come unto the nations in His most great majesty. Turn your faces towards Him, 0 concourse of the righteous. 

 This is the day whereon the Rock (Peter) crieth out and shouteth, and cele-brateth  the praise of its Lord, the All-Possess-ing, the Most High, saying: "La! The Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled! ." My body longeth for the cross, and Mine head waiteth the thrust of the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful, that the world may be purged from its transgressions.... 

  0 Supreme Pontiff! Incline 

 thine ear unto that which the Fashioner of mouldering bones counselleth thee, as voiced by Him Who is His Most Great Name. 

 Sell all the embellished ornaments thou dost possess, and expend them in the path of God, Who causeth the night to return upon the day, and the day to return upon the night. Abandon thy kingdom unto the kings, and emerge from thy habitation, with thy face set towards the Kingdom, and, detached from the world, then speak forth the praises of thy Lord betwixt earth and heaven. Thus hath bidden thee He Who is the Possessor of Names, on the part of thy Lord, the Almighty,  the Mi-Knowing. 

 Exhort thou the kings and say: "Deal equitably with men. Beware  lest ye transgress the bounds fixed in the


<p18>
18                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Book." This indeed becometh thee. Beware lest thou appropriate unto thyself the things of the world and the riches thereof. 

 Leave them unto such as desire them, and cleave unto that which bath been enjoined upon thee by Him Who is the Lord of creation. Should any one offer thee all the treasures of the earth, refuse to even glance upon them. Be as thy Lord hath been. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken that which God hath made the ornament  of the book of creation... Should the inebriation  of the wine of My verses seize thee, and thou determinest to present thyself before the throne of thy Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven, make My love thy vesture and thy shield remembrance of Me, and thy provision reliance upon God, the Revealer of all power... Verily, the day of ingathering is come, and all things have been separated from each other. He hath stored away that which He chose in the vessels of justice, and cast into fire that which befitteth it. Thus hath it been decreed by your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, in this promised Day. 

 1-le, verily, ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is none other God save He, the Almighty, the 

All-Compelling.            
                           
     To THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE OF VARIOUS FAITHS

  At one time We address the people of the Torah and summon them unto Him Who is the Revealer of verses, Who liath come from Him Who layeth low the necks of men.... At another, We address the people of the Evangelandsay:"The All-Glorious is come in this Name whereby the Breeze of God hath wafted over all regions.".. .At still another, We address the people of the Qur'an saying: "Fear the All-Merciful, and cavilnot at Him through Whom all religions were founded." 

 Know thou, moreover, that We have addressed to the Magians Our Tablets, and adorned them with Our Law.. We have revealed in them the essence of all the hints and allusions contained in their Books. The Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing. 

  CALL out to Zion, 0 Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: lie that was hidden from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty  is manifest; His all-encompassing splendour  is revealed. 

 Beware lest thou hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that hath descended ftorn heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled in adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart, and the company of the most exalted angels. 0 how I long to announce unto every spot on the surface of the earth, and to carry to each one of its cities, the glad-tidings of this Revelation — a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai hath been attracted, and in whose name the Burning Bush is calling: "Unto God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven." 

 Verily this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement, the Day for which have been laid up those things which God, through a bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for revelation. 

 Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Bah~ who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.

  A view of the bridge at Biiyiikpekmece, Turkey, over which Baha'u'llah and His entourage crossed on the twelve-day journey from Constantinople to Adrianople in December, 1863. 

  'THE Breath hath been wafted, and the Breeze hath blown, and from Zion hath appeared that which was hidden, and from Jerusalem is heard the Voice of God, the One, the Incomparable, the 

Omniscient.                

  LEND an ear unto the song of David. He saith: "Who will bring me into the 

Strong City ?" The Strong  

 City is 'Akka,, which hath been named the Most Great Prison, and which possesseth a fortress and mighty ramparts... Peruse that which Isaiah hath spoken in His Book. He saith: "Get thee up into the high mountain, 0 Zion, that bringest good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, 0 Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings. Lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judali: 

'Behold your God! Behold   

 the Lord God will come with strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him."' This Day all the signs have appeared. A great City hath descended from heaven, and Zion trembleth and exulteth with joy at the Revelation of God, for it bath heard the Voice of God on every side. 
                           
O CONCOURSE of Christians! 

 We have, on a previous occasion, revealed Ourseif unto you, and ye recognized Me not. This is yet another occasion vouchsafed unto you. This is the Day of God; turn ye unto Him. 

 The Beloved One loveth not that ye be consumed with the fire of your desires. 

 Were ye to be shut out as by a veil from Him, this would be for no other reason than your own waywardness and ignorance. 

 Ye make mention of Me, and know Me not. Ye call upon Me, and are heedless of My Revelation. 0 people of the Gospel! They who were not in the Kingdom have now entered it, whilst We behold you, in this day, tarrying at the gate. Rend the veils asunder by the power of your Lord, the Almighty,  the All-Bounteous, and enter, then, in My name My Kingdom. 

 Thus biddeth you He XTho desireth for you everlasting life. We

 behold you, 0 children of the Kingdom, in darkness. 

 This, verily, beseemeth you not. Are ye, in the face of the Light, fearful because of your deeds? 

 Direct yourselves towards Him... Verily, He (Jesus) said: "Come ye after Me, and I will make you to become fishers of men." In this day, however, We say: "Come ye after Me, that We may make you to become quickeners of mankind." 

  WE, verily, have come for your sakes, and have borne the misfortunes of the world for your salvation. Flee ye the One Who bath sacrificed His life that ye may be quickened? Fear God, 0 followers of the Spirit (Jesus), and walk not in the footsteps of every divine that bath gone far astray.. Open the doors of your hearts. 

 He Who is the Spirit (Jesus) verily, standeth before them. Wherefore keep ye afar from Him Who hath purposed to draw you nigh unto a Resplendent Spot? Say: We, in truth, have opened unto you the gates of the Kingdom. 

 Will ye bar the doors of your houses in My face? 

 This indeed is naught but a grievous  error. 

  O   CONCOURSE of patriarchs ! He Whom ye were promised in the Tablets is come. 

 Fear God, and follow not the vain imaginings of the superstitious. Lay aside the things ye possess, and take fast hold of the Tablet of God by His sovereign power. Better is this for you than all your possessions. Unto this testifieth every understanding heart, and every man of insight. Pride ye yourselves on My Name and yet shut yourselves out as by a veil from Me? This indeed  is a strange thing! 

  O    CONCOURSE of archbishops! 

 He Who is the Lord of all men hath appeared. 

 In the plain of guidance He calleth mankind, whilst ye are numbered with the dead! Great is the blessedness of him who is stirred by the Breeze of God, and hath arisen from amongst the dead in this perspicuous Name. 

  0     CONCOURSE of bishops! 

 Trembling hath seized all the kindreds of the earth, and He Who is the Everlasting Father calleth aloud between earth and heaven. Blessed the ear that hath heard, and the eye that hath seen, and the heart that hath turned unto Him Who is the Point of Adoration of all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth.... 

  0     CONCOURSE of bishops! 

 Ye are the stars of theheaven of Myknowledge. Mymercy desireth not that ye should fall upon the earth. My justice, however, declareth: "This is that which the Son (Jesus) bath decreed." 

 And whatsoever  hath proceeded out of His blameless, His truth-speaking, trustworthy mouth, can never be altered. 

 The bells, verily, peal out My Name, and lament over Me, but My spirit re-joiceth  with evident gladness. The body of the Loved One yearneth for the cross, and His head is eager for the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful.  The ascendancy of the oppressor can in no wise deter Him from His purpose.. The stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen, they that adduce the proofs they possess in order to demonstrate the truth of My Cause, and who make mention of God in My name. When I came unto them, in My majesty, however,  they turned aside from Me. They, verily, are of the fallen. 

 This is what the Spirit (Jesus) prophesied when He came with the truth, and the Jewish doctors caviled at Him, until they committed what made the Holy Spirit to lament, and the eyes of such as enjoy near access to God to weep. 

  0  CONCOURSE of priests! 

 Leave the bells, and come forth, then, from your churches. It behoveth you, in this day, to proclaim aloud the Most Great Name among the nations. Prefer  ye to be silent, whilst every stone and every tree shouteth aloud: "The Lord is come in His great glory!". 

 He that summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, and he will show forth that which is beyond the power of all that are on earth... Let the Breeze of God awaken you. Verily, it hath wafted over the world. Well is it with him that hath discovered the fragrance thereof and been accounted among the well-assured....

 He Who was in heaven bath come. He, verily, is the One Whom ye were promised in the Books of God, the Holy, the Almighty, the All-Praised.  How long will ye wander in the wilderness  of heedlessness and superstition? Turn with your hearts in the direction of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. 

  0    CONCOURSE of monks! Seclude not yourselves in churches and cloisters. Come forth by My leave, and occupy yourselves with that which will profit your souls and the souls of men. 

 Thus biddeth you the King of the Day of Reckoning. 

 Seclude yourselves in the stronghold  of My love. This, verily, is a befitting seclusion, were ye of them that perceive it. He that shutteth himself up in a house is indeed as one dead. 

 It behoveth man to show forth that which xviii profit all created things, and he that bring-eth forth no fruit is fit for fire. Thus counselleth you your Lord, and He, verily, is the Almighty, the Mi-Bounteous. 

 Enter ye into wedlock, that after you someone may fill your place. 

 We have forbidden you perfidious acts, and not that which will demonstrate fidelity. Have ye clung to the standards fixed by your own selves, and cast the standards of God behind your backs? 

 Fear God, and be not of the foolish. But for man, who would make mention of Me on My earth, and how could My attributes and My name have been revealed? Ponder ye, and be not of them that are veiled and fast asleep. He that wedded not (Jesus) found no place wherein to dwell or lay Ills head, by reason of that which the hands of the treacherous had wrought. 

 His sanctity consisteth not in that which ye believe or fancy, but rather in the things We possess. 

 Ask, that ye may apprehend His station which hath been exalted above the imaginings of all that dwell on earth. Blessed are they who perceive it. CONCOURSE of monks! If ye choose to follow Me, I will make you heirs of My Kingdom;  and if ye transgress against Me, I will, in My longsuffering, endure it patiently, and I, verily, am the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merci-ful... 

 Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. We hear her voice saying: "0 most generous Lord! 

 Where is Thy great glory established? The sweet savours of Thy presence have quickened ened me, after I had melted in my separation from 

Thee. Praised be Thou     

 in that Thou hast raised the veils, and come with power in evident glory." 

 We called unto her from behind the Tabernacle of Majesty and Grandeur: 

"0 Bethlehem!  This Light

 hath risen in the orient, and travelled towards the occident, until it reached thee in the evening of its life. Tell Me then: Do the sons recognize the Father, and acknowledge Him, or do they deny Him, even as the people aforetime denied Him (Jesus) ?" 

 Whereupon she cried out saying: "Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the Best-Informed." 

  CONSIDER, likewise, how numerous at this time are the monks who have secluded themselves in their churches, in My name, and who, when the appointed time came, and We unveiled to them Our beauty, failed to recognize Me, notwithstanding that they call upon Me at dawn and at eventide. 

  IREAD ye the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the All-Glorious Lord? 

 This indeed beseemeth you not, 0 concourse of learned men! The fragrances of the All-Merciful  have wafted over all creation. 

 Happy the man that hath forsaken his desires, and taken fast hold of guidance. 

  PERUSED ye not the Qur'an Read it, that haply ye may find the Truth, for this Book is verily the Straight Path. This is the Way of God unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. If ye have been careless of the Qur'an, the BayAn cannot be regarded to be remote from you. 

 Behold it open before your eyes. Read ye its verses, lest perchance ye desist from committing that which will cause the Messengers of God to mourn and lament.

God of Mercy. Witness     
how ye gainsay His signs! 

 The earth hath quaked with a great quaking, and cast forth her burdens. Will ye not admit it? Say: Will ye not recognize how the mountains have become like flocks of wool, how the people are sore vexed at the

  A view of Gallipoli, Turkey, where Baha'u'llah and "about seventy" exiles spent three nights in August, 1868, before leaving for 'Akka. At the hour of His departure Baha'u'llah warned His companions that this journey will be unlike any of the previous journeys... 

  awful majesty of the Cause of God? Witness how their houses are empty ruins, and they themselves a drowned host. 

 This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful bath come down in the clouds of knowledge, clothed with manifest sovereignty. 

 He well knoweth the actions of men. He it is Whose glory none can mistake, could ye but comprehend  it. The heaven of every religion hath been rent, and the earth of human understanding been cleft asunder, and the angels of God are seen descending. Say: This is the Day of mutual deceit; whither do ye flee? The mountains have passed away, and the heavens have been folded together, and the whole earth is held within His grasp, could ye but understand it. Who is it that can protect you? None, by Him Who is the All-Merciful! 

 None, except God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Beneficent. Every woman that hath had a burden in her womb hath cast her burden. We see men drunken  in this Day, the Day in which men and angels have been gathered together. 

 Is there any doubt concerning God? Behold how He hath come down from the heaven of His grace, girded with power and invested with sovereignty. 

 Is there any doubt concerning His signs? Open ye your eyes, and consider His clear evidence. Paradise is on your right hand, and hath been brought nigh unto you, while Hell hath been made to blaze. Witness its devouring flame. Haste ye to enter into Paradise, as a token of Our mercy unto you, and drink ye from the hands of the Mi-Merciful the Wine that is life indeed. 
                           
BY Him Who is the Great    
Announcement! The All-Merciful

 is come invested with undoubted  sovereignty. 

 The Balance bath been appointed, and all them that dwell on earth have been gathered together. The Trumpet bath been blown, and lo, all eyes have stared up with tenor, and the hearts of all who are in the heavens and on the earth have trembled, except them whom the breath of the verses of God


<p23>
WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH          23

 bath quickened, and who have detached themselves from all things. 

 This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings. The workers of iniquity are her burdens, could ye but perceive it. The moon of idle fancy hath been cleft, and the heaven bath given out a palpable smoke. 

 We see the people laid low, awed with the dread of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Most Powerful. The Crier hath cried out, and men have been torn away, so great hath been the fury of His wrath. 

 The people of the left hand sigh and bemoan. 

 The people of the right abide in noble habitations: they quaff the Wine that is life indeed, from the hands of the All-Merciful, and are, verily, the blissful. 

 The earth hath been shaken, and the mountains  have passed away, and the angels have appeared, rank on rank, before Us. Most of the people are bewildered in their drunkenness and wear on their faces the evidences of anger. Thus have We gathered together the workers of iniquity. We see them rushing on towards their idol. Say: None shall be secure this Day from the decree of God. This indeed is a grievous Day. We point out to them those that led them astray. They see them, and yet recognize them not. Their eyes are drunken; they are indeed a blind people. Their proofs are the calumnies they uttered; condemned are their calumnies by God, the Help in Peril, the 

Self-Subsisting.  The      

 Evil One bath stirred up mischief  in their hearts, and they are afflicted with a torment that none can avert. 

 They hasten to the wicked, bearing the register of the workers  of iniquity. 
Such are their doings.     

 Say: The heavens have been folded together, and the earth is held within His grasp, and the corrupt doers have been held by their forelock, and still they understand not. They drink of the tainted water, and know it not. 

 Say: The shout hath been raised, and the people have come forth from their graves, and arising are gazing around them. Some have made haste to attain the court of the God of Mercy, others have fallen down on their faces in the fire of Hell, while still others are lost in bewilderment. 

 The verses of God have been revealed, and yet they have turned away from them. His proof hath been manifested and yet they are unaware of it. And when they behold the face of the All-Merciful, their own faces are saddened, while they are disporting themselves. They hasten forward to Hell Fire, and mistake it for light. Far from God be what they fondly imagine! Say: Whether ye rejoice or whether ye burst for fury, the heavens are cleft asunder, and God hath come down, invested with radiant sovereignty.  All created things are heard exclaiming: "The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." 
                           
O CONCOURSE of Persian     

 divines! In My name ye have seized the reins of men, and occupy the seats of honour by reason of your relation to Me. 

 When I revealed Myself, however,  ye turned aside, and committed what hath caused the tears of such as have recognized Me to flow. Erelong will all that ye possess perish, and your glory be turned into the most wretched abasement, and ye shall behold the punishment for what ye have wrought, as decreed  by God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. 

  O YE divines of the City ! We came to you with the truth, whilst ye were heedless of it. Methinks ye are as dead, wrapt in the coverings of your own selves. Ye sought not Ourpresence, when so to do would have been better for you than all your doings.. Know ye, that had your leaders, to whom ye own allegiance, and on whom ye pride yourselves, and whom ye mention  by day and by night, and from whose traces ye seek guidance — had they lived in these days, they would have circled around Me, and would not have separated themselves from Me, whether at eventide or at morn. 

 Ye, however, did not turn your faces towards My face, for even less than a moment, and waxed proud, and were careless of this Wronged One, Who hath been so afflicted by men that they dealt with Him as they pleased. 

 Ye failed to inquire about My condition, nor did ye inform yourselves of the things which befell Me. Thereby have ye withheld from yourselves the winds of holiness, and the breezes of bounty, that blow from this luminous and perspicuous Spot. Methinks  ye have clung to ougward things, and forgotten the inner things, and say that which ye do not. Ye are lovers of names, and appear to have given yourselves up to them. For this reason make ye mention of the names of your leaders. 

 And should any one like them, or superior unto them, come unto you, ye would D


<p24>
24                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 flee him. Through their names ye have exalted yourselves, and have secured your positions, and live and prosper. And were your leaders to reappear, ye would not renounce your leadership,  nor would ye turn in their direction, nor set your faces towards them. We found you, as We found most men, worshipping names which they mention during the days of their life, and with which they occupy themselves. No sooner do the Bearers of these names appear, however, than they repudiate them, and turn upon their heels.... 

 Know ye that God will not, in this day, accept your thoughts, nor your remembrance of Him, nor your turning towards Him, nor your devotions, nor your vigilance, unless ye be made new in the estimation of this Servant, could ye but perceive it. B ECAUSE of you the Apostle (Muhammad) lamented, and the Chaste One (FAlimili) cried out, and the countries were laid waste, and darkness fell upon all regions. 
0 concourse of divines!   

 Because of you the people were abased, and the banner of Ishm was hauled down, and its mighty throne subverted. Every time a man of discernment hath sought to hold fast unto that which would exalt IslAm, you raised a clamour, and thereby was He deterred from achieving His purpose, while the land remained fallen in clear ruin. 

  OF all the peoples of the world, they that have suffered the greatest loss have been, and are still, the people of Persia. 

 I swear by the Day Star of Utterance which shineth upon the world in its meridian glory! The lamentations of the pulpits, in that country, are being raised continually. 

 In the early days such tamentations were heard in the Land of TA (Tihr~n), for pulpits, erected for the purpose of remembering the True One — exalted be His glory — have now, in Persia, become places wherefrom blasphemies  are uttered against Him Who is the Desire of the worlds. 

  IN this day the world is redolent with the fragrances of the robe of the Revelation of the Ancient King.. 

 and yet, they (divines) have gathered together, and established themselves upon their seats, and have spoken that which would put an animal to shame, how much more man himself! Were they to become aware of one of their acts, and perceive the mischief it hath wrought, they would, with their own hands, dispatch themselves to their final abode. 

  CONCOURSE of divines!... 

 Lay aside that which ye possess, and hold your peace, and give ear, then, unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur and Majesty speaketh. How many the veiled handmaidens who turned unto Me, and believed, and how numerous the wearers of the turban who were debarred from Me, and followed in the footsteps of bygone generations! 

  0 HIGH priests! Ears have been given you that they may hearken unto the mystery of Him Who is the Self-Dependent, and eyes that they may behold Him. Wherefore flee ye? 

The Incomparable Friend   

 is manifest. He speaketh that wherein lieth salvation. 

 Were ye, 0 high priests, to discover the perfume of the rosegarden  of understanding, ye would seek none other but Him, and would recognize, in His new vesture, the 

All-Wise and Peerless     

 One, and would turn your eyes from the world and all who seek it, and would arise to help Him. 

  WHATSOEVER bath been announced in the Books hath been revealed and made clear. From every direction the signs have been manifested. 

 The Omnipotent One is calling, in this Day, and announcing the appearance of the Supreme Heaven. 

  THIS is not the day whereon the high priests can command and exercise their authority. 

 In your Book it is stated that the high priests will, on that Day, lead men far astray, and will prevent them from drawing nigh unto Him. He indeed is a high priest who hath seen the light and hastened unto the way leading to the Beloved. 
                          
0 HIGH priests! The Hand  

 of Omnipotence is stretched forth from behind the clouds; behold  ye it with new eyes. The tokens of His majesty and greatness are unveiled; gaze ye on


<p25>
WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH          25

 them with pure eyes. Say, 0 high priests! Ye are held in reverence because of My Name, and yet ye flee Me! Ye are the high priests of the Temple. 

 Had ye been the high priests of the Omnipotent One, ye would have been united with Him, andwouldhaverecognizedHim.... Say, 0 high priests! No man's acts shall be acceptable, in this Day, unless he forsaketh mankind and all that men possess, and setteth his face towards the Omnipotent One. 

  An aerial view of presentday 'Ak/Cd. The exile of Baha'u'llah in 'Akka and environs extended from August 31, 1868, until His death on May 29, 1892. The large structure in the lower right foreground is the Most Great Prison. Behind it, and to the left, can be seen the dome and minaret of the mosque where "the text of the farmdn" banishing Baha'u'llah "was read publicly, soon after the arrival of the exiles. as a warning to the population". 

  c. THE GREAT ANNOUNCEMENT TO MANKIND THE time foreordained unto the peoples and kindreds of the earth is now come. 

 The promises of God, as recorded in the holy Scriptures,  have all been fulfilled. Out of Zion hath gone forth the Law of God, and Jerusalem, and the hills and land thereof, are filled with the glory of His Revelation. 

 Happy is the man that pondereth in his heart that which hath been revealed  in the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. 

 Meditate upon this, 0 ye beloved of God, and let your ears be attentive unto His Word, so that ye may, by His grace and mercy, drink your fill from the crystal waters of constancy, and become as steadfast and immovable as the mountain in His 

Cause.                     

  VERILY I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold the Face, and hear the Voice, of the Promised One. The Call of God bath been raised, and the light of His countenance hath been lifted up upon men. 
It behoveth every


<p26>
26                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 man to blot out the trace of every idle word from the tablet of his heart, and to gaze, with an open and unbiased mind, on the signs of His Revelation, the proofs of His Mission, and the tokens of His glory. 
     Great indeed is this Day!  

 The allusions made to it in all the sacred Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. The soul of every Prophet  of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this wondrous Day. All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to attain it. No sooner, however, had the 

Day Star of His Revelation 

 manifested itself in the heaven of God's Will, than all, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to guide, were found dumbfounded and heedless. 

 0     thou that hast remembered Me! The most grievous veil bath shut out the peoples of the earth from His glory, and hindered them from hearkening to His call. 

 God grant that the light of unity may envelop the whole earth, and that the seal, "the Kingdom is God's", may be stamped upon the brow of all its peoples. 

  O     YE children of men! The fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote  the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. Suffer it not to become a source of dissension and discord, of hate and enmity. 

 This is the straight Path, the fixed and immovable foundation.  Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure. Our hope is that the world's religious leaders and the rulers thereof will unitedly arise for the reformation of this age and the rehabilitation of its fortunes. Let them, after meditating on its needs, take counsel together and, through anxious and full deliberation, administer to a diseased and sorely-afflicted world the remedy it requires.. 

 It is incumbent upon them who are in authority to exercise moderation in all things. Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease to exert a beneficial influence. 

 Consider for instance such things as liberty, civilization and the like. 

 However much men of understanding may favourably regard them, they will, if carried to excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon men... 

 Please God, the peoples of the world may be led, as the re-suit of the high endeavours exerted by their rulers and the wise and learned amongst men, to recognize their best interests. 

 How long will humanity persist in its waywardness ? How long will injustice continue? How long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men? How long will discord agitate the face of society? The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction, and the strife that divideth and afflict-eth  the human race is daily increasing. 

 The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing  order appeareth to be lamentably defective. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that He may graciously awaken the peoples of the earth, may grant that the end of their conduct may be profitable unto them, and aid them to accomplish  that which beseemeth their station. 

  O   CONTENDING peoples and kindreds of the earth! 

 Set your faces towards unity, and let the radiance of its light shine upon you. Gather ye together, and for the sake of God resolve to root out whatever is the source of contention amongst you. Then will the effulgence  of the world's great Luminary envelop the whole earth, and its inhabitants become the citizens of one city, and the occupants of one and the same throne. This Wronged One hath ever since the early days of His life, cherished none other desire but this, and will continue to entertain no wish except this wish. 

 There can be no doubt whatever that the peoples of the world, of whatever race or religion, derive their inspiration from one heavenly Source, and are the subjects of one God. The difference between  the ordinances under which they abide should be attributed to the varying requirements  and exigencies of the age in which they were revealed. All of them, except a few which are the outcome of human perversity, were ordained of God, and are a reflection of His Will and Purpose. Arise and, armed with the power of faith, shatter to pieces the gods of your vain imaginings, the sowers of dissension amongst you. Cleave unto that which draweth you together and uniteth you. This, verily, is the most exalted Word which the Mother Book bath sent down and revealed unto you. To this beareth witness the Tongue of Grandeur from His habitation of glory.

WRITINGS OF BARk' U' LLAH        27

  A close view of the prison at 'Ak/al. The two windows on the right are those of the room occupied by Baha'u'llah. 

  THE Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and tranquillity of the world and the advancement of its peoples, bath written: The time must come when the imperative  necessity for the holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally  realized. 

 The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world's Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace de-mandeth that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the tranquillity of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves.  Should any king take up arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him. 

 If this be done, the nations of the world will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories. This will ensure the peace and composure of every people, government  and nation. We fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth, the mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of God, may attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught of tyranny.... The day is approaching  when all the peoples of the world will have adopted one universal language and one common  script. When this is achieved, to whatsoever  city a man may journey, it shall be as if he were entering his own home. These things are obligatory and absolutely essential. It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding  to strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and action. 

 That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race. The 

Great Being saith: Blessed 

 and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. In another passage He hath proclaimed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.


<p28>
28                 THE RAHA'i WORLD
THE All-Knowing Physician 

 hath His finger on the pulse of mankind. He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom,  the remedy. Every age hath its own problem,  and every soul its particular aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its presentday afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned  with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements. 

 We can well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed with great, with incalculable  afflictions. 

 We see it languishing on its bed of sickness, sore-tried and disillusioned. They that are intoxicated by self-conceit have interposed themselves between it and the Divine  and infallible Physician. Witness how they have entangled all men, themselves included, in the mesh of their devices. 

 They can neither discover the cause of the disease, nor have they any knowledge of the remedy. They have conceived  the straight to be crooked, and have imagined their friend an enemy. 

 Incline your ears to the sweet melody of this Prisoner. 

 Arise, and lift up your voices, that haply they that are fast asleep may be awakened.  Say: 0 ye who are as dead! 

 The Hand of Divine bounty proffereth unto you the 

Water of Life. Hasten     
and drink your fill.      

 Whoso hath been reborn in this Day, shall never die; whoso remaineth dead, shall never live. 

  0    PEOPLES of the earth! 

 God, the Eternal Truth, is My witness that streams of fresh and soft-flowing waters have gushed from the rocks, through the sweetness of the words uttered by your Lord, the Unconstrained; and still ye slumber. Cast away that which ye possess, and, on the wings of detachment, soar beyond all created things. Thus biddeth you the Lord of creation, the movement of Whose Pen bath revolutionized the soul of mankind. 

 Know ye from what heights your Lord, the All-Glorious is calling? Think ye that ye have recognized the Pen wherewith your Lord, the Lord of all names, commandeth you? 

 Nay, by My life! Did ye but know it, ye would renounce the world, and would hasten with your whole hearts to the presence of the Well-Beloved. Your spirits would be so transported by His Word as to throw into commotion the Greater World — how much more this small and petty one! Thus have the showers of My bounty been poured down from the heaven of My lovingkindness,  as a token of My grace; that ye may be of the thankful... 

 Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination provoke divisions among you. Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the members  of one body. 

 Thus counselleth you the Pen of Revelation, if ye be of them that believe. 

 Consider the mercy of God and His gifts. He enjoineth upon you that which shall profit you, though He Himself can well dispense with all creatures. Your evil doings can never harm Us, neither can your good works profit Us. We summon you wholly for the sake of God. To this every man of understanding and insight will testify. 

  T HE world's equilibrium bath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order. Manidud's ordered life bath been revolutionized though the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed. 

 Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths. 

 Take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination to embrace the truth of this Cause — a Cause through which the potentialities  of the might of God have been reveaLed, and His sovereignty established. With faces beaming  with joy, hasten ye unto Him. This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future. Let him that seeketh, attain it; and as to him that hath refused to seek it — verily, God is Self-Sufficient, above any need of His creatures. 

 Say: This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of God is holding, in which all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth are weighed, and their fate determined, if ye be of them that believe and recognize this truth. Say: Through it the poor have been enriched, the learned enlightened, and the seekers enabled to ascend unto the presence of God. Beware, lest ye make it a cause of dissension amongst you. Be ye as firmly settled as the immovable mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving.

WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH          29
O     YE peoples of the world!

 Know assuredly that My commandments are the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My mercy for My creatures. Thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation. 

 Were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments, shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving-kind-ness. 

 From My laws the sweet smelling savour of My garment can be smelled, and by their aid the standards of victory will be planted upon the highest peaks. 

 The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven of My omnipotent glory, addressed to My creation these words: "Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty." 

 Happy is the lover that bath inhaled  the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which no tongue can describe. 

 By My life! He who bath drunk the choice wine of fairness from the hands of My bountiful favour, will circle around My commandments that shine above the Dayspring of My creation. 

 Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed  the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power. To this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation hath revealed. Meditate upon this, 0 men of insight! 

 Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of Mine utterance, they must be faithfully  obeyed by all, though My decree be such as to cause the heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder. He doth what He pleaseth. He chooseth; and none may question 

His choice. Whatsoever     

 He, the Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily, beloved. To this He Who is the Lord of all creation beareth Me witness. Whoso bath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful, and recognized the Source of this utterance, will welcome with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of the laws of God amongst men. Well is it with him that bath turned thereunto, and apprehended the meaning of His decisive decree. 

  217' HIS is the Day in which God's most excellent favours have been poured out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into all created things. 

 It is incumbent  upon all the peoples of the world to reconcile  their differences, and, with perfect unity and peace, abide beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and lovingkindness. 

 It behoveth them to cleave to whatsoever will, in this Day, be conducive to the exaltation of their stations, and to the promotion of their best interests. Happy are those whom the all-glorious Pen was moved to remember, and blessed are those men whose names, by virtue of Our inscrutable decree, We have preferred to conceal. 

 Beseech ye the one true God to grant that all men may be graciously assisted to fulfil ihat which is acceptable in Our sight. 

 Soon will the presentday order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead. Verily, thy Lord speak-eth  the truth, and is the Knower of things unseen.

SELECTIONS FROM THE WRITINGS OF

          SHOGHI EFFENDI ABOUT BAHA'U'LLAH

  n THE BIRTH OF THE BAHA'I REVELATION (From God Passes By, Chapter VJ, pp. 91 — 103) ... At a time when the Cause of the Bab seemed to be hovering on the brink of extinction, when the hopes and ambitions which animated it had, to all human seeming, been frustrated, when the coThssal sacrifices of its unnumbered lovers appeared to have been made in vain, the Divine Promise enshrined within it was about to be suddenly redeemed, and its final perfection mysteriously manifested. The B~bi Dispensation  was being brought to its close (not prematurely  but in its own appointed time), and was yielding its destined fruit and revealing its ultimate purpose — the birth of the 

Mission of Baha'u'llah.    

 In this most dark and dreadful hour a New Light was about to break in glory on Persia's sombre horizon. As a result of what was in fact an evolving, ripening process, the most momentous if not the most spectacular stage in the Heroic Age of the Faith was now about to open. 

 During nine years, as foretold by the Wit Himself, swiftly, mysteriously and irresistibly the embryonic Faith conceived by Him had been developing until, at the fixed hour, the burden of the promised Cause of God was cast amidst the gloom and agony of the SiyAh~hA1 of TihrTh. 

 "Behold," Bahft'u'llThHimself,years later, testified, in refutation of the claims of those who had rejected the validity of His mission following so closely upon that of the Mb, "how immediately upon the completion of the ninth year of this wondrous, this most holy and merciful Dispensation, the requisite number of pure, of wholly consecrated and sanctified souls has been most secretly consummated." "That so brief an intervah" He, moreover has asserted, "should have separated this most mighty and wondrous 

Revelation from Mine       

 own previous Manifestation is a secret that no man can unravel, and a mystery such as no mind can fathom. 

 Its duration had been foreordained." 

 St. John the Divine had himself, with reference to these two successive Revelations, deafly prophesied: "The second woe is past; and, behold the third woe cometh quickly." "This third woe," 'Abdu'l-Baha, commenting upon this verse, has explained, "is the day of the Manifestation of Baha'u'llah, the Day of God, and it is near to the day of the appearance c/the 13db." 

 "All the peoples of the world," He moreover  has asserted, "are awaiting two Manifestations,  Who must be contemporaneous; a!! wait for the fulfilment of this promise." And again: "The essential fact is that all are promised two Manifestations, Who will come one following on the other." 5fiaykh Ahmad-i-AhsA'i,  that luminous star of Divine guidance who had so clearly perceived, before the year sixty, the approaching glory of Baha'u'llah, and laid stress upon "the twin Revelations which are to follow each other in rapid succession," had, on his part, made this significant statement regarding the approaching hour of that supreme Revelation, in an epistle addressed in his own hand to Siyyid Kazfin: "The mystery of this Cause must needs be made manifest, and the secret of this Message must needs be divulged. II can say no more. I can appoint no time. His Cause will be made known after hun (68)." 

 The circumstances in which the Vehicle of this newborn Revelation, following with such swiftness that of the Bab, received the first intimations of His sublime mission recall, and indeed surpass in poignancy the soul-shaking experience of Moses when confronted by the Burning Bush in the wilderness of Sinai; of Zoroaster when awakened to His mission by a succession of seven visions; of Jesus when coming out of the waters of the Jordan He saw the heavens opened and the Holy Ghost descend  like a dove and light upon Him; of Muhammad when in the Cave of Hira, outside 30


<p31>
WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI        31

 of the holy city of Mecca, the voice of Gabriel bade Him "cry in the name of Thy Lord"; and of the Bab when in a dream He approached the bleeding head of the ImAm Ijusayn, and, quafling the blood that dripped from his lacerated throat, awoke to find Himself the chosen recipient of the ourpouring grace of the Almighty. 

 What, we may well inquire at this juncture, were the nature and implications of that Revelation which, manifesting itself so soon after the Declaration of the Bab, abolished, at one stroke, the Dispensation which that Faith had so newly proclaimed, and upheld, with such vehemence and force, the Divine authority of its Author? 

 What, we may well pause to consider,  were the claims of Him Who, Himself a disciple of the DAb, had, at such an early stage, regarded Himself as empowered to abrogate the Law identified with His beloved Master? What, we may further reflect, could be the relationship between the religious Systems established before Him and His own 

Revelation  — a Revelation  

 which, flowing out, in that extremely perilous hour, from His travailing soul, pierced the gloom that had settled upon that pestilential pit, and, bursting though its walls, and propagating itself as far as the ends of the earth, infused into the entire body of mankind its boundless potentialities, and is now under our very eyes, shaping the course of human society? 

 He Who in such dramatic circumstances was made to sustain the overpowering weight of so glorious a Mission was none other than the One Whom posterity will acclaim, and Whom innumerable followers already recognize, as the Judge, the Lawgiver and Redeemer of all mankind, as the Organizer of the entire planet, as the Unifier of the children of men, as the Inaugurator  of the long-awaited millennium, as the Originator of a new "Universal Cycle", as the Establisher of the 

Most Great Peace, as the Fountain

 of the Most Great Justice, as the Proclaimer of the coming of age of the entire human race, as the Creator of a new World Order, and as the Inspirer and Founder of a world civilization. 

 To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the "Everlasting Father", the "Lord of Hosts" come down "with ten thousands of saints"; to Christendom Christ returned "in the glory of the Father" to 

Shi'ah                     

 Ts1~m the return of the Im~±m tiusayn; to Sunni IslAm the descent of the 

"Spirit of God" (Jesus     

 Christ); to the Zoroastrians the promised  ShTh-Bahnim; to the Hindus the reincarnation of Krishna; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha. 

 In the name He bore He combined those of the Im~m ~Iusayn, the most illustrious of the successors of the Apostle of God — the brightest "star" shining in the "crown~~ mentioned in the Revelation of St. John — and of the 

Im~m 'A Ii, the Commander  

 of the Faithful, the second of the two "witnesses"extolled in that same Book. He was formally designated Baha'u'llah, an appellation specifically recorded in the Persian Baydn, signifying at once the glory, the light and the splendour of God, and was styled the "Lord of 

Lords", the "Most Great    

 Name", the "Ancient Beauty", the "Pen of the Most High", the 

"Hidden Name", the "Preserved
Treasure", "He Whom God    
will make manifest", the "Most

Great Light", the "MI-Highest
Horizon",  the "Most Great

 Ocean", the "Supreme Heaven", the "Pre-Existent Root", the "Self-Subsistent", the "Day — Star of the Universe", the "Great Announcement", the "Speaker on Sinai", the "Sifter of Men", the "Wronged One of the World", the "Desire of the Nations" the "Lord of the Covenant", the "Tree beyond which there is no passing". 

 He derived His descent, on the one hand, from Abraham (the Father of the Faithful) through his wife Katurali, and on the other from Zoroaster, as well as from Yazdigird, the last king of the SAsAnfyAn dynasty. lie was moreover a descendant  of Jesse, and belonged, through His father, Mirza 'Abbas, better known as Mirza Buzurg — a nobleman closely associated with the ministerial circles of the Court of Fath-'A1I ShAh — to one of the most ancient and renowned families of 

M~izindarAn.               

 To Him Isaiah, the greatest of the Jewish prophets, had alluded as the "Glory of the Lord," the "Everlasting Father," the "Prince of Peace," the "Wonderful," the "Counsellor," the "Rod come forth out of the stem of Jesse" and the "Branch grown out of His roots," Who "shall be established upon the throne of David," Who "will come with strong hand," Who "shall judge among the nations," Who "shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips slay the wicked," and Who "shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather

  together the dispersed of Judah from the Ibur corners of the earth." Of Him David had sung in his Psalms, acclaiming Him as the "Lord of Hosts" and the 

"King of Glory." To Him Haggai

 had referred as the "Desire of all nations," and Zachariah as the "Branch" Who "shall grow up out of His place," and "shall build the Temple of the Lord." Ezekiel had extolled  Him as the "Lord" Who "shall be king over all the earth," while to His day Joel and Zephaniah had both referred as the "day of Jehovah," the latter describing it as "a d~y of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers." 

His Day Ezekiel and Daniel 

 had, moreover, both acclaimed as the "day of the Lord," and Malachi described as "the great and dreadful day of the Lord" when "the 

Sun of Righteousness"     

 will "arise, with healing in His wings," whilst Daniel had pronounced His advent as signalizing the end of the "abomination that inaketh desolate." 

 To His Dispensation the sacred books of the followers of Zoroaster had referred as that in which the sun must needs be brought to a standstill for no less than one whole month. 

 To Him Zoroaster must have alluded when, according to tradition, He foretold that a period of three thousand years of conflict and contention  must needs precede the advent of the Worid-Saviour Sh~ih-Bahr~im, Who would triumph over Abriman and usher in an era of blessedness and peace. 

 He alone is meant by the prophecy attributed to Gautama Buddha Himself, that "a Buddha named Maitreye, the Buddha of universal fellowship" should, in the fullness of time, arise and reveal "His boundless glory." 

To Him the Rhagavad-Gita   

 of the Hindus had referred as the "Most Great Spirit," the "Tenth Avatar," the 

"Immaculate Manifestation  
of Krishna."               

 To Him Jesus Christ had referred as the "Prince of this world", as the "Comforter" Who will "reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness,  andofiudgement," as the "Spirit of Truth" Who "will guide you into all truth," Who "shall not speak c~f Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak," as the "Lord of the Vineyard," and as the "Son of Man" Who "shall come in the glory of His Father" "in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory," with "all the holy angels" about Him, and "all nations" gathered before His throne. 

 To Him the Author of the Apocalyspe had alluded as the "Glory of God," as "Alpha and Omega," "the Beginning and the End," "the First and the Last." 

Identifying His Revelation 

 with the "third woe," he, moreover, had extolled His Law as "a new heaven anda new earth," as the "Tabernacle of God," as the "Holy City," as the "New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." 

To His Day Jesus Christ    

 Himself had referred as "the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of His glory." 

 To the hour of His advent St. Paul had alluded as the hour of the "last trump," the "trump of God," whilst St. Peter had spoken of it as the "Day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat." His Day he, furthermore,  had described as "the times of refreshing,"  "the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets since the world began." 

  To Him Mu1~ammad, the Apostle

 of God, had alluded in His Book as the "Great An-~zouncement,"  and declared His Day to be the Day whereon "God" will "come down" "over-shadowed  with clouds," the Day whereon "thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank," and "The Spirit shall arise and the angels shall be ranged in order." His advent He, in that Book, in a s~irih said to have been termed by Him "the heart of the ~ur'~n,"had foreshadowed as that of the "third" Messenger, sent down to "strenghten" the two who preceded Him. To His Day He, in the pages of that same Book, had paid a glowing tribute, glorifying it as the "Great Day," the "Last Day," the "Day of God," the "Day of Judgement," the "Day of Reckoning," the "Day of Mutual Deceit," the "Day of Severing," the "Day of Sighing," the "Day of Meeting," the Day "when the Decree shall be accomplished," the Day whereon the second "Trumpet blast" will be sounded, the "Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the world," and "all shall come to Him in humble guise," the Day when "thou shalt see the mountains, which thou thinkest so firm, pass away with the passing of a cloud," the Day "wherein account shall be taken," "the approaching  Day, when men's hearts shall rise up,


<p34>
34                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

 choking them, into their throats," the Day when "all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth shall be terror-stricken, save him whom God pleaseth to deliver," the Day whereon "every suckling woman shailforsake her sucking babe, and every woman that hatl'z a burden in her womb shall cast her burden," the Day "when the earth shall shine with the light of her Lord, and the Book shall be set, and the Prophets shall be brought up, and the witnesses; and judgement shall be given between them with equity; and none shall be wronged." 

 The plenitude of His glory the Apostle of God had, moreover, as attested by Baha'u'llah Himself, compared to the 'full moon on its fourteenth night." His station the 

Im~m 'Au, the Commander    

 of the Faithful, had, according to the same testimony, identified with "Him Who conversed with Moses from the Burning Bush on Sinai." To the transcendent character of His mission the Tm~m Ijusayn had, again according to Baha'u'llah, borne witness as a "Revelation whose Revealer will be He Who revealed" the Apostle of God Himself. 

 About Him ~hayi~i2 Ahmad-i-A~is~i'i, the herald of the B~bi Dispensation, who had foreshadowed the "strange happenings" that would transpire "between the years Sixty and sixty-seven," and had categorically affirmed the inevitability of His Revelation had, as previously  mentioned, written the following: "The Mystery of this Cause must needs be made manifest, and the Secret of this Message must needs be divulged. I can say no more, I can appoint no time. His Cause will be made known after Ijfn (68)" (i.e., after a while). 

    Siyyid K64m-i-Rashti ShaykhAlimad's

 disciple  and successor, had likewise written: "The Q~'im must needs be put to death. After He has been slain the world will have attained the age of eighteen." 

 In his Sharii-i-Qa~iidiy-i-Ldmiyyih he had even alluded to the name Furthermore, to his disciples, as his days drew to a close, he had significantly declared :"Verily, I say, after the Q~'im the Qayyi~im will be made manifest. 

 For when the star of the former has set the sun of the beauty of Ijusayn will rise and illuminate the whole world. Then will be unfolded  in all its glory the 'Mystery' and the 'Secret' spoken of by ~haykli Abmad. 

 To have attained unto that Day of Days is to have attained unto the crowning glory of past generations, and one goodly deed performed in that age is equal to the pious worship of countless centuries." 

 The BTh had no less significantly extolled Him as the "Essence of Being," as the "Remnant of God," as the "Omnipotent Master," as the "Crimson, all-encompassing Light," as "Lord of the visible and invisible," as the "sole Object of all previous Revelations, including the Revelation  of the Qd'im Himself." He had formally designated Him as "He Whom God shall make manifest," had alluded to Him as the "AMid Horizon" wherein He Himself lived and dwelt, had specifically recorded His title, and eulogized  His "Order" in His bestknown work, the Persian Baydn, had disclosed His name through His allusion to the "Son of 'Au, a true and undoubted Leader of men," had, repeatedly, orally and in writing, fixed, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the time of His Revelation, and warned His followers lest "the Baydn and all that hatli been revealed therein" should "shut them out as by a veil" from Him. 

 He had, moreover,  declared that He was the "first servant to believe in Him," that He bore Him allegiance "before all things were created," that "no allusion" of His "could allude unto Him," that "the year-old germ that holdeth within itself the potentialities of the Revelation that is to came is endowed with a potency superior to the combined  forces of the whole of the Baydn." 

 He had, moreover, clearly asserted that He had "covenanted with all created things" concerning Him Whom God shall make manifest ere the covenant concerning His own mission had been established. 

 He had readily acknowledged that He was but "a letter" of that "Most Mighty Book," "a dewdrop" from that "Limitless Ocean," that His Revelation was "only a leaf amongst the leaves of His Paradise," that "all that bath been exalted in the Bay~n" was but "a ring" upon His own hand, and He Himself "a ring upon the hand of Him Whom Godshall make manifest," Who, "turnetli it as Hepleasetlz,for whatsoever Hepleasetli, and through whatsoever He pleaseth." 

 He had unmistakably declared that He had "sacrificed" Himself "wholly" for Him, that He had "consented to be cursed" for His sake, and to have "yearned for naught but martyrdom" in the path of His love. 

 Finally, He had unequivocally prophesied: "Today the Baydn is in the stage of seed; at the beginning of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make man West its ultimate perfection will become ap

 parent." "Ere nine will have elapsed from the inception of this Cause the realities of the created things will not be made manifest. 

 All that thou hast as yet seen is but the stage from the moist-germ until We clothed it with flesh. 

 Be patient until thou beholdest a new creation. 

Say:                      

 Blessed, therefore, be God, the Most Excellent of 

Makers!"                  

 "He around Whom the Point of the Baydn (Bab) hath revolved is come" is Baha'u'llah's confirmatory testimony to the inconceivable greatness and preeminent character of His own Revelation. 

 "If all who are in heaven and on earth," He moreover affirms, "be investedin this day with the powers and attributes destined for the Letters of the Baycin, whose station is ten thousand times more glorious than that of the Letters of the Qur'tinic Dispensation, and if they one and all should, swift as the twinkling of an eye, hesitate to recognize My Revelation, they shall be accounted, in the sight of God, of those that have gone astray, and regarded as 'Letters of Negation."' "Powerful is He, the King of Divine might," He, alluding to Himself in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn, asserts, "to extinguish with one letter of His wondrous words, the breath of iWe in the whole of the Baydn and the people thereof, and with one letter bestow upon them a new and everlasting life, and cause them to arise and speed out of the sepulchres of their vain and selfish desires." "This," He furthermore declares, "is the king of days," the "Day of God Himself," the "Day which .vhall never be followed by night," the "Springtime which autumn will never overtake," "the eye to past ages and centuries," for which "the soul of every Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted," for which "all the divers kindreds of the earth have yearned," through which "God hath proved the hearts of the entire company of His Messengers and Prophets, and beyond them those that stand guard over His sacred and inviolable  Sanctuary, the inmates of the Celestial Pavilion and dwellers of the Tabernacle of Glory." "In this most mighty Revelation," He moreover, states, "all the Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their final consummation." And again: "None among the Manifestations of old, except to a prescribed degree, hath ever completely apprehended the nature of this Revelation." Referring to His own station He declares: "But for Him no Divine Messenger would have been invested with the Robe of Proplietlicod, nor would any of the sacred Scriptures have been revealed." 

 And last but not least is 'Abdu'l-Baha's own tribute to the transcendent character of the Revelation identified with His Father: "Cen-turks, nay ages, must pass away, ere the DayStar  of Truth shineth again in its midsummer splendour, or appeareth once more in the radiance of its vernal glory." "The mere contemplation of the Dispensation inaugurated by the Blessed Beauty," He furthermore affirms, "would have sufficed to overwhelm the saints of bygone ages —  saints who longed to partake for one moment of its great glory." "Concerning the Manifestations that will come down in the future 'in the shadows of the clouds,' know verily," is His significant statement, "that in so far as their relation to the source of their inspiration is concerned they are under the shadow of the Ancient Beauty. In their relation, however, to the age in which they appear, each and every one of them 'doeth whatsoverHe willeth,"' And finally stands this, His illuminating  explanation, setting forth conclusively the true relationship between the Revelation of Baha'u'llah and that of the BTh: "The Revelation of the Bab may be likened to the sun, its station corresponding to the first sign of the Zodiac — the sign Aries — which the sun enters at the vernal equinox. 

 The station of Baha'u'llah's Revelation, on the other hand, is represented by the sign Leo, the sun's midsummer and highest station. By this is meant that this holy Dispensation  is illumined with the light of the Sun of Truth shining fron7 its most exalted station, and in the plenitude of its resplendency, its heat and glory." 

 To attempt an exhaustive survey of the prophetic references to Baha'u'llah's Revelation would indeed be an impossible task. 

 To this the pen of Baha'u'llah Himself bears witness: 

"All the Divine Books     

 and Scriptures have predicted and announced unto men the advent of the Most Great Revelation. None can adequately recount the verses recorded in the Books of former ages which forecast this supreme Bounty, this most mighty 

Bestowal."                

 In conclusion of this theme, I feel it should be stated that the Revelation identified with Baha'u'llah abrogates unconditionally all the Dispensations gone before it, upholds uncompromisingly  the eternal verities they enshrine,  recognizes firmly and absolutely the Divine origin of their Authors, preserves in

  violate the sanctity of their authentic Scriptures, disclaims any intention of lowering the status of their Founders or of abating the spiritual ideals they inculcate, clarifies and correlates their functions, reaffirms their common,  their unchangeable and fundamental purpose, reconciles their seemingly divergent claims and doctrines, readily and gratefully recognizes their respective contributions to the gradual unfoldment of one Divine Revelation, unhesitatingly acknowledges itself to be but one link in the chain of continually progressive Revelations, supplements their teachings with such laws and ordinances as conform to the imperative needs, and are dictated by the growing  receptivity, of a fast evolving and constantly changing society, and proclaims its readiness and ability to fuse and incorporate the contending  sects and factions into which they have fallen into a universal Fellowship, functioning within the framework, and in accordance with the precepts, of a divinely conceived, a world-unifying,  a world-redeeming 

Order.                     

 A Revelation, hailed as the promise and crowning glory of past ages and centuries, as the consummation of all the Dispensations within the Adamic Cycle, inaugurating an era of at least a thousand years' duration, and a cycle destined to last no less than five thousand centuries, signalizing the end of the Prophetic Era and the beginning of the Era of Fulfilment, unsurpassed alike in the duration of its Author's ministry and the fecundity and splendour of His mission — such a Revelation was, as already noted, born amidst the darkness of a subterranean dungeon in TibrAn — an abominable pit that had once served as a reservoir of water for one of the public baths of the city. Wrapped in its Stygiafi gloom, breathing its fetid air, numbed by its humid and icy atmosphere, His feet in stocks, His neck weighted down by a mighty chain, surrounded by criminals and miscreants of the worst order, oppressed by the consciousness of the terrible blot that had stained the fair name of His beloved Faith, painfully aware of the dire distress that had overtaken its champions, and of the grave dangers that faced the remnant of its followers — at so critical an hour and under such appalling circumstances the "Most Great Spirit," as designated by Himself, and symbolized in the Zoroastrian, the Mosaic, the Christian, and Mu1~ammadan Dispensations by the Sacred Fire, the Burning Bush, the Dove and the Angel Gabriel respectively, descended upon, and revealed itself, personated by a "Maiden," to the agonized soul of Baha'u'llah. 

 "One night in a dream," He Himself, calling to mind, in the evening of His life, the first stirrings of God's Revelation within His soul, has written, "these exalted words were heard on every side: 'Verily, We shall render Thee victorious  by Thyself and by Thy pen. Grieve Thou not for that which bath befallen Thee, neither be Thou afraid, for Thou art in safety. Ere long will God raise up the treasures c/the earth — men who will aid Thee through Thyself and through Thy Name, wherewith God bath revived the hearts of such as have recognized Him."' In another passage He describes, briefly and graphically, the impact of the onrushing force of the Divine Summons upon His entire being — an experience  vividly recalling the vision of God that caused Moses to fall in a swoon, and the voice of Gabriel which plunged Muhammad into such consternation that, hurrying to the shelter of His home, He bade His wife, Khadijih, envelop  Him in His mantle. 

 "During the days hay in the prison of Tihrdn," are His own memorable words, "though the galling weight of the chains and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep, still in those infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed from the crown of My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth upon the earth from the summit of a lofty mountain. 

 Every limb of My body would, as a result, be set afire. At such moments My tongue recited what no man could bear to hear." 

     In His Sdratu'l-Haykal     

 (the Sarili of the Temple) He thus describes those breathless moments when the Maiden, symbolizing the "Most Great Spirit" proclaimed His mission to the entire creation: "While engulfed in tribulations I heard a most wondrous, a most sweet voice, calling above My bead. Turning My face, I beheld a Maiden — the embodiment of the remembrance of the name of My Lord — suspended in the air before Me. 

 So rejoiced was she in her very soul that her countenance shone with the ornament of the good-pleasure of God, and her cheeks glowed with the brightness of the All-Merciful.  Betwixt earth and heaven she was raising a call which captivated the hearts and minds of men. She was imparting to both My inward and outer being tidings which rejoiced

 soul, and the souls of God's honoured servant. Pointing with her finger unto My head, she addressedall who are in heaven and all who are on earth, saying: 'By God! This is the Best-Beloved of the worlds, and yet ye comprehend not. This is the Beauty of God amongst you, and the power of His sovereignty within you. 
could ye but understand.  

 This is the Mystery of God and His Treasure, the Cause of God and His glory unto all who are in the kingdoms of Revelation and of creation, if ye be of them that perceive."' 

    In His Epistle to Nd~'iri'd-Din

 Sh~~Iz His royal adversary, revealed at the height of the proclamation of His Message, occur these passages which shed further light on the Divine origin of 

His mission: "0 King!      

 I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when Ic, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And he bade Me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, andfor this there befell Me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow... This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of Thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised, have stirred. His all-compelling summons bath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise amidst all people. 

 I was indeed as one dead wizen His behest was uttered. 

 The hand of the will of Thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Merclfu4 transformed 

Me." "By My Life!" He      

 asserts in another Tablet, "Not of Mine own volition have I revealed Myself, but GocA of His own choosing, bath manifested Me." And again: "Whenever I chose to hold My peace and be still, lo, the Voice of the Holy Spirit, standing on My right hand, aroused Me, and the Most Great Spirit appeared before My/ace, and Gabriel overshadowed Me, and the Spirit of Glory stirred within My bosom, bidding Me arise and break My silence." 

 Such were the circumstances in which the Sun of Truth arose in the city of Tihr~n — a city which, by reason of so rare a privilege conferred upon it, had been glorified by the B~b as the "Holy Land," and surnamed by 

Baha'u'llah                 

 "the Mother of the world," the "Dayspring of Light," the "Dawning-Place of the signs of the Lord," the "Source of the joy of all mankind." The first dawnings of that Light of peerless splendour had, as already described, broken in the city of Shir~iz. 

 The rim of that Orb had now appeared above the horizon of the SiyTh-Ch~iI of TibrAn. Its rays were to burst forth, a decade later, in Baghdad, piercing the clouds which immediately after its rise in those sombre surroundings  obscured its splendour. It was destined to mount to its zenith in the faraway city of Adrianople, and ultimately to set in the immediate vicinity of the fortress-town of 'Akka. 

 The process whereby the effulgence of so dazzling a Revelation was unfolded to the eyes of men was of necessity slow and gradual. The first intimation which its Bearer received did not synchronize with, nor was it followed immediately by, a disclosure of its character to either His own companions or His kindred. A period of no less than ten years had to elapse ere its far-reaching implications could be directly divulged to even those who had been intimately associated with Him — a period of great spiritual ferment, during which the Recipient of so weighty a Message restlessly anticipated the hour at which He could unburden  His heavily laden soul, so replete with the potent energies released by God's nascent Revelation. 

 All He did, in the course of this preordained interval, was to hint, in veiled and allegorical language, in epistles, commentaries, prayers and treatises, which He was moved to reveal, that the Bab's promise had already been fulfilled, and that He Himself was the One Who had been chosen to redeem it. A few of His fellow-disciples, distinguished by their sagacity, and their personal attachment and devotion to Him, perceived the radiance of the as yet unrevealed  glory that had flooded His soul, and would have, but for His restraining influence, divulged His secret and proclaimed it far and wide.

                   2. BAHA'U'LLAH

 (Part I of The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, published in The World Order of Baha'u'llah, pp. 97 — 119) To the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the West. 

  Fellow-labourers in the 

Divine Vineyard:          

  On the 23rd of May of this auspicious year1 the Baha'i world will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.    

 We, who at this hour find ourselves standing on the threshold of the last decade of the first century of the Baha'i era, might well pause to reflect upon the mysterious dispensations  of so august, so momentous a Revelation. How vast, how entrancing the panorama which the revolution of four score years and ten unrolls before our eyes! Its towering grandeur well-nigh overwhelms us. To merely contemplate  this unique spectacle, to visualize, however  dimly, the circumstances attanding the birth and gradual unfoldment of this supreme Theophany, to recall even in their barest outline  the woeful struggles that proclaimed its rise and accelerated its march, will suffice to convince every unbiased observer of those eternal truths that motivate its life and which must continue to impel it forward until it achieves its destined ascendancy. 

 Dominating the entire range of this fascinating spectacle towers the incomparable figure of Baha'u'llah, transcendental in His majesty, serene, awe-inspiring, unapproachably glorious.  Allied, though subordinate in rank, and invested with the authority of presiding with Him over the destinies of this supreme Dispensation, there shines upon this mental picture the youthful glory of the BTh, infinite in His tenderness, irresistible in His charm, unsurpassed in His heroism, matchless in the dramatic circumstances of His short yet eventful life. And finally there emerges, though on a plane of its own and in a category entirely apart from the one occupied by the twin Figures that preceded Him, the vibrant, the magnetic personality of 'Abdu'l-Baha, reflecting to a degree that no man, however exalted his station, can hope to rival, the glory and power with which 1934. 

 They who are the Manifestations of God are alone endowed. 

 With 'Abdu'l-Baha's ascension, and more particularly with the passing of His well-beloved  and illustrious sister the Most Exalted Leaf — the last survivor of a glorious and heroic age — there draws to a close the first and most moving chapter of Baha'i history, marking the conclusion of the 

Primitive, the Apostolic  
Age of the Faith ofBah6iu'lhh.

 It was 'Abdu'l-Baha Who, through the provisions of His weighty Will and Testament, had forged the vital link which must for ever connect the age that has just expired with the one we now live in — the Transitional and Formative period of the Faith — a stage that must in the fullness of time reach its blossom and yield its fruit in the exploits and triumphs that are to herald the Golden Age of the Revelation of 

Baha'u'llah.              
     Dearly-beloved friends!   

 The onrushing forces so miraculously released through the agency of two independent and swiftly successive  Manifestations are now under our very eyes and through the care of the chosen stewards of a far-flung Faith being gradually mustered and disciplined. They are slowly crystallizing into institutions that will come to be regarded as the hallmark and glory of the age we are called upon to establish and by our deeds immortalize. 

 For upon our presentday efforts, and above all upon the extent to which we strive to remodel our lives after the pattern of sublime heroism associated with those gone before us, must depend the efficacy of the instruments we now fashion — instruments that must erect the structure of that blissful Commonwealth which must signalize the Golden Age of our 

Faith.                    

 It is not my purpose, as I look back upon these crowded years of heroic deeds, to attempt even a cursory review of the mighty events that have transpired since 1844 until the present day. Nor have I any intention to undertake an analysis of the forces that have precipitated them, or to evaluate their influence upon peoples and institutions in almost every conti E

 nent of the globe. The authentic record of the lives of the first believers of the primitive period of our Faith, together with the assiduous research which competent Baha'i historians will in the future undertake, will combine to transmit to posterity such masterly exposition of the history of that age as my own efforts can never hope to accomplish. My chief concern at this challenging period of Baha'i history is rather to call the attention of those who are destined to be the champion-builders of the Administrative Order of Baha'u'llah to certain fundamental verities the eLucidation of which must tremendously assist them in the effective prosecution of their mighty enterprise. 

 The international status which the Religion of God has thus far achieved,moreover, imperatively  demands that its root principles be now definitely clarified. 

 The unprecedented impetus which the illustrious deeds of the American believers have lent to the onward march of the Faith; the intense interest which the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West is fast awakening among divers races and nations; the rise and steady consolidation of Baha'i institutions in no less than forty of the most advanced countries of the world; the dissemination of Baha literature in no fewer than twenty-five of the most widely-spoken languages; the success that has recently attended the nationwide efforts of the Persian believers in the preliminary  steps they have taken for the establishment,  in the outskirts of the capital-city of their native land, of the third Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Baha'i world; the measures that are being taken for the immediate formation of their first National Spiritual Assembly representing the interests of the overwhelming majority of Baha'i adherents; the projected erection of yet another pillar of the Universal House of Justice, the first of its kind, in the Southern Hemisphere;  the testimonies, both verbal and written, that a struggling Faith has obtained from Royalty, from governmental institutions, international  tribunals, and ecclesiastical dignitaries; the publicity it has received from the charges which unrelenting enemies, both new and old, have hurled against it; the formal enfranchisement of a section of its followers from the fetters of Muslim orthodoxy in a country that may be regarded as the most enlightened among Islamic nations — these afford ample proof of the growing momentum with which the invincible community of the Most Great Name is marching forward to ultimate victory. 
 Dearly-beloved friends!    

 I feel it incumbent upon me, by virtue of the obligations and responsibilities which as Guardian of the Faith of Baha'u'llah I am called upon to discharge, to lay special stress, at a time when the light of publicity is being increasingly focussed upon us, upon certain truths which lie at the basis of our Faith and the integrity of which it is our first duty to safeguard. 

 These verities, if valiantly upheld and properly assimilated, will, I am convinced, powerfully reinforce the vigour of our spiritual life and greatly assist in counteracting the machinations of an implacable  and vigilant enemy. 

 To strive to obtain a more adequate understanding of the significance of Baha'u'llah's stupendous Revelation must, it is my unalterable  conviction, remain the first obligation and the object of the constant endeavour of each one of its loyal adherents. An exact and thorough comprehension of so vast a system, so sublime a revelation, so sacred a trust, is for obvious reasons beyond the reach and ken of our finite minds. We can, however, and it is our bounden duty to seek to derive fresh inspiration and added sustenance as we labour for the propagation of His Faith through a clearer apprehension of the truths it enshrines and the principles on which it is based. 

 In a communication addressed to the American  believers I have in the course of my explanation  of the station of the 18Th made a passing reference to the incomparable greatness of the Revelation of which 

He considered Himself      
to be the humble Precursor.

 He Whom Baha'u'llah  has acclaimed in the Kitdb-i-fqdn as that promised Q~'im Who has manifested no less than twenty-five out of the twenty-seven letters which all the Prophets were destined to reveal —  so great a Revealer has Himself testified to the preeminence of that superior Revelation that was soon to supersede His own. "The germ," the Bab asserts in the Persian Baydn, "that holds within itself the potentialities of the Revelation that is to come is endowed with apotency superior to the combined forces of all those who follow me." 

 "Of all the tributes," lie again affirms, "I have paid to Him Who is to come after Me, the greatest is this, My written confession, that no words of Mine can adequately describe Him, nor


<p42>
42                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 can any reference to Him in My Book, the Baydn, do justice to His Cause." 

 "The Bayt~n," He in that same Book categorically declares, "and whosoever is therein revolve round the saying of 'Him Whom God shall make manifest,' even as the A hf (the Gospel) and whosoever was therein revolved round the saying of Mukammad, the Apostle of God." "A thousand perusals of the Baydn," He further remarks, "cannot equal the perusal of a single verse to be revealed by 'Him Whom God shall make manifrst.'... Today the Baydn is in the stage of seed, at the beginning of the manifestation of'Hiin Whom God shall make manifest' its ultimate perfection will become apparent. 

 The Baydn and such as are believers therein yearn more ardently after Him than the yearning of any lover after his beloved. The Bay~~n deriveth all its glory from 'Him Whom God shall make mamfest.' 

 All blessing be upon him who believeth in Him and woe betide him that reject eth His truth." 

    Addressing Siyyid Yaby~y-i-D~rThi

 surnamed  Valiid, the most learned, the most eloquent and influential among His followers, the Bab utters this warning: "By the righteousness of Him Whose power causeth the seed to germinate and Who breatheth the spirit of life into all things, were Ito be assured that in the day of His manifestation thou wilt deny Him, I would unhesitatingly disown thee and repudiate thy faith. If, on the other hand, I be told that a Christian, who beareth no allegiance to My Faith, will believe in Him, the same will I regard as the apple of Mine Eye." 

 In one of His prayers He thus communes with 

Baha'u'llah: "Exaltedart  
Thou, 0 my Lord the Omnipotent!

 How puny and contemptible my word and all that pertaineth unto me appear unless they be related to Thy great glory. Grant that through the assistance of Thy grace whatsoever pertaineth unto me may be acceptable in Thy sight." 

 In the Qayyi~mu'l-Asmd'-—  the BTh's commentary  on the Si~rih of Joseph — characterized by the Author of the Iqan as "the first, the greatest and mightiest" of the books revealed by the Bab, we read the following references to Baha'u'llah: "Out of utter nothingness, 0 great on2nlpotent Master, Thou hast, through the celestial potency of Thy might, brought mefortli and raised me up to proclaim this Revelation. I have made none other but Thee my trust, I have clung to no will but Thy will... 

0 Thou Remnant            

 of God! I have sacrificed myse if wholly for Thee; 1 have accepted curses for Thy sake, and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path of Thy love. 

Sufficient witness Unto   

 me is God, the Exalted, the Protector, the Ancient of Days." "And when the appointed hour hat/i struck," He again addresses Baha'u'llah in that same commentary,  "do Thou, by the leave of God, the All~ Wise, reveal from the heights of the 

Most Lofty and Mystic     

 Mount a faint, an infinitesimal glimmer of Thy impenetrable Mystery, that they who have recognized the radiance of the Sinaic Splendour may faint away and die as they catch a lightening glimpse of the fierce and crimson Light that envelops Thy Revelation." 

 As a further testimony to the greatness of the Revelation identified with Baha'u'llah may be cited tile following extracts from a Tablet addressed  by 'Abdu'l-Baha to an eminent Zoroastrian follower of the Faith: "Thou hadst written that in the sacred books of the followers of Zoroaster it is written that in the latter days, in three separate Dispensations, the sun must needs be brought to a standstill. 

 In the first Dispensation, it is predicted, the sun will remain motionless for ten days, in the second for twice that time; in the third for no less than one whole month. 

 The interpretation of this prophecy is this: the first Dispensation to which it refers is the 

Mukammadan Dispensation   

 during which the Sun of Truth stood stilifor ten days. Each day is reckoned as one century. 

The Mu~ammadan Dispensation

 must have, therefore, lasted no less than one thousand years, which is precisely the period that has elapsed from the setting of the Star of the Imamate to the advent of the Dispensation proclaimed by the 13db. 

The second Dispensation  

 referred to in this prophecy is the one inaugurated by the 13db Himself; which began in the year 1260 A.H. and was brought to a close in the year 1280 A.H. As to the third 

Dispensation              

 — the Revelation proclaimed by Baha'u'llah —  inasmuch as the Sun of Truth when attaining that station shinetli in the plenitude of its meridian splendour its duration hath been fixed for a period of one whole month, which i.s~ the maximum  time taken by the sun to pass through a sign of the Zodiac. From this thou canst imagine the magnitude of the Baha'i cycle — a cycle that must extend over a period of at least five hundred thousand years." 

 From the text of this explicit and authoritative interpretation of so ancient a prophecy it is


<p43>
XVRITIKGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI       43

 evident how necessary it is for every faithful follower of the Faith to accept the divine origin and uphold the independent status of the Mu1~ammadan Dispensation. 

 The validity of the Imamate is, moreover, implicitly recognized  in these same passages — that divinely-appointed institution of whose most distiim guished member the 13Th Himself was a lineal descendant, and which continued for a period of no less than two hundred and sixty years to he the chosen recipient of the guidance of the Almighty and the repository of one of the two most precious legacies of IslAm. 

 This same prophecy, we must furthermore recognize, attests the independent character of the Bab Dispensation and corroborates indirectly the truth that in accordance with the principle of progressive revelation every Manifestation of God must needs vouchsafe to the peoples of His day a measure of divine guidance ampler than any which a preceding and less receptive age could have received or appreciated. For this reason, and not for any superior merit which the Baha'i Faith may be said to inherently possess, does this prophecy bear witness to the unrivalled power and glory with which the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah has been invested — a Dispensation the potentialities  of which we are but beginning to perceive and the full range of which we can never determine. 

  The Faith of Baha'u'llah   

 should indeed be regarded, if we wish to be faithful to the tremendous  implications of its message, as the culmination of a cycle, the final stage in a series of successive, of preliminary and progressive revelations. 

 These, beginning with Adam and ending with the BTh, have paved the way and anticipated with an ever-increasing emphasis the advent of that Day of Days in which He Who is the Promise of All Ages should be made manifest. 

 To this truth the utterances of Baha'u'llah abundantly testify. A mere reference to the claims which, in vehement language and with compelling power, He Himself has repeatedly advanced cannot but fully demonstrate the character of the Revelation of which He was the chosen bearer. To the words that have streamed from His pen — the fountainhead of so impetuous  a Revelation — we should, therefore, direct our attention if we wish to obtain a clearer understanding of its importance and meaning. Whether in His assertion of the unprecedented claim He has advanced, or in His allusions to the mysterious forces He has released, whether in such passages as extol the glories of His long-awaited Day, or magnify the station which they who have recognized its hidden virtues will attain, Baha'u'llah and, to an almost equal extent, the 11Th and 'Abdu'l-Baha, have bequeathed to posterity mines of such inestimable wealth as none of us who belong to this generation can befittingly estimate. 

 Such testimonies bearing on this theme are impregnated with such power and reveal such beauty as oniy those who are versed in the languages in which they were originally revealed can claim to have sufficiently appreciated. 

 So numerous are these testimonies that a whole volume would be required to be written in order to compile the most outstanding among them. 

 All I can venture to attempt at present is to share with you oniy such passages as I have been able to glean from His voluminous writings. 

    "Itestify before Godj"     

 proclaims Baha'u'llah, "to the greatness, the inconceivable greatness of this Revelation. 

 Again and again have We in most of Our Tablets borne witness to this truth, that mankind may be roused from its heedlessness." "In this most mighty Revelation," He unequivocally  announces, "all the Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their final consummation."  "That which hatli been made manifest in this preiminent, this most exalted Revelation, stands unparalleled in the annals of the past, nor will future ages witness its like." "He it is," referring to Himself He further proclaims, "Who in the Old Testament hath been named Jehovah, Who in the Gospel bath been designated as the Spirit of Truth, and in the Qur'an acclaimed as the Great Announcement." "But for Him no Divine Messenger would have been invested with the robe of prophethood, nor would any of the sacred scriptures have been revealed. 

 To this bear witness all created things." "The word which the one true God uttereth in this day, though that word be the most familiar and commonplace of terms, is invested with supreme, with unique distinction." "The generality of mankind is still immature. 

 Had it acquired sufficient capacity We would have bestowed upon it so great a measure of Our knowledge that all who dwell on earth and in heaven would have found themselves, by virtue of the grace stream

 ing from Our pen, completely independent of all knowledge save the knowledge of God, and would have been securely established upon the throne of abiding tranquillity." "The Pen of Holiness, I sokrnnly affirm before God, hath writ upon My snow-white brow and in characters of effulgent glory these glowing, these musk-scented  and holy words: 'Belioldye that dwell on earth, and ye denizens of heaven, bear witness, He in truth is your Well-Beloved, lie it is Whose like the world of creation bath not seen, He Whose ravishing beauty bath delighted the eye of God, the Ordainer, the All-Powerful, the Incomparable!"' "Followers of the Gospel," Baha'u'llah addressing the whole of Christendom exclaims, "behold the gates of heaven are flung open. He that had ascended unto it i now come. Give ear to His voice calling aloud over land and sea, announcing  to all mankind the advent of this Revelation — a Revelation through the agency of which the Tongue of Grandeur is now proclaiming: 'Lo, the sacredPledge hath been fulfihled,for He, the Promised One, is come)"' "The voice of the Son of Man is calling aloud from the sacred yak: 'Here am I, here am I, 0 God my God!'... whilst from the Burning Bush breaketh forth the cry: 'Lo, the Desire of the world is made manifest in His transcendent glory!' 

 Tue Father bath come. That which ye were promised in the Kingdom of God is fulfilled. This is the Word which the Son veiled when He said to those around Him that at that time they could not bear it... Verily the Spirit of Truth is come to guide you unto all truth. He is the One Who glorified the Son and exalted His Cause.. ." "The Comforter Whose advent all the scriptures have promised is now come that He may reveal unto you all knowledge and wisdom. Seek Him over the entire surface of the earth, haply ye may find Him." 

 "Call out to Zion, 0 Carmel," writes Baha'u'llah,  "and announce the joyful tidings: 'He that was hidden from mortal eyes is come! 

 His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing splendour is revealed. 

 Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that hath descended from heaven — the celestial Kaaba round which have circled in adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart and the company of the most exalted angels."' "I am the One," He in another connection affirms, "Whom the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were adorned." 

 "The glory of Sinai hath hastened to circle round the Dayspring of this Revelation, while from the heights of the Kingdom the voice of the Son of God is heard proclaiming: 'Bestir yourselves, ye proud ones of the earth, and hasten ye towards Him.' Carmel hath in this day hastened in longing adoration to attain His court, whilst from the heart of Zion there cometli the cry: 'The promise of all ages is now fulfilled. 

 That which had been announced in the Holy Writ of God, the Beloved, the Most High, is made manifest."' "Ijajdz is astir by the breeze announcing the tidings of joyous reunion. 

 'Praise be to Thee,' We hear her exclaim, '0 my Lord, the Most High. 

 I was dead through my separation from Thee; the breeze laden with the fragrance of Thy presence hath brought me back to life. Happy is he that turneth unto Thee, and woe betide the erring."' "By the one true God, Elijah bath hastened unto My court and liath circumambidated in the day time and in the night season My throne of glory." "Solomon in all his majesty circles in adoration around Me in this day, uttering this most exalted word: 'I have turned my face toward.~ Thy face, o Thou omnipotent Rukr of the world! I am wholly detached from all things pertaining unto me, and yearn for that which Thou dost possess."' "Had 

Muhammad, the Apostle     

 of God, attained this Day," Baha'u'llah writes in a Tablet revealed on the eve of His banishment to the penal colony of 'Akka, "He would have exclaimed:  'I have truly recognized Thee, 0 Thou the Desire of the Divine 

Messengers!' Had Abraham  

 attained it, He too, faIling prostrate upon the ground, and in the utmost lowliness before the Lord thy God, would have cried: 'Mine heart is filled with peace, 0 Thou Lord of all that is in heaven and on earth! I testify that Thou hast unveiled before mine eyes all the glory of Thy power and the full majesty of Thy law!'... Had Moses Himself attained it, He, likewise, would have raised Hi~v voice saying: 'All praise be to Thee for having lifted upon me the light of Thy countenance and enrolled me among them that have been privileged to behold Thy face!"' "North and South both vibrate to the call an-flouncing the advent of our Revelation.

  Thou, 0 Belo ved of earth and heaven,for having turned the agony of my separation from Thee into the joy of a life-giving reunion!"' "By the righteousness of God~" Baha'u'llah wishing to reveal the full potency of His invincible  power asserts, "should a man, all alone, arise in the name of Baha and put on the armour of His love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious, though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed against him." "By God besides Whom is none other God! Should any one arise for the triumph of Our Cause, him will God render victorious though tens of thousands of enemies be leagued against him. And if his love for Me wax stronger, God will establish his ascendancy over all the powers of earth and heaven. 

 Thus have We breathed the spirit of power into all regions." 

 "This is the King of Days," He thus extols the age that has witnessed the advent of His Revelation, "the Day that hath seen the coming of the Best-beloved~ Him Who through all eter-nUy bath been acclaimed the Desire of the World." 

 "The world of being shineth in this Day with the resplendency of this Divine Revelation. A 11 created things extol its saving grace and sing its praises. The universe is wrapt in an ecstasy of joy and gladness. The Scriptures of past Dispensations celebrate the great]ubilee that must needs greet this most great Day of God. Well is it with him that bath lived to see this Day and hath recognized its station." "Were mankind to give heed in a befitting manner to no more than one word of such a praise it would be so filled with delight as to be overpowered and lost in wonder. Entranced, it would then shine forth resplendent above the horizon of true understanding." 

 "Be fair, ye peoples of the world;" He thus appeals to mankind, "is it meet and seemly for you to question the authority of one Whose presence 'He Who conversed with God'(Moses) hath longed to attain, the beauty of Whose countenance 

'God's Well-beloved'       

 (Muliammad) had yearned to behold, through the potency of Whose love the 'Spirit of God' (Jesus) ascended to heaven, for Whose sake the 'Primal Point' (the BTh) offered up His life?" "Seize your chance," He admonishes His followers, "inasmuch as a fleeting moment in this Day excelleth centuries of a bygone age. Neither sun nor moon hadi witnessed a day such as ....... It is evident that every age in which a Manifestation of God bath lived is divinely ordained and may, in a sense, be characterizedas God'sappointedDay. 

 This Day, however, is unique and is to be distinguishedfrom those that have preceded it. The designation 'Seal of the Prophets' fully reveals and demonstrates its high station." 

 Expatiating on the forces latent in His Revelation Baha'u'llah reveals the following: "Through the movement of Our Pen of glory We have, at the bidding of the omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new life into every human frame and instilled into every word a fresh potency. All created things proclaim the evidences of this worldwide regeneration." 

 "This is," He adds, "the most great, the most joyfultidings imparted by the Pen of this Wronged One to mankind." "How great," lie in another passage exclaims, "is the Cause! How staggering the weight of its message! 

 This is the Day of which it hath been said: '0 my son! verily God will bring everything to light though it were but the weight of a grain of mustard seed~ and hidden in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth; for God is subtile, in-forn2ed of all."' "By the righteousness of the one true God! If one speck of a jewel be lost and buried beneath a mountain of stones, and lie hidden beyond the seven seas, the Hand of Omnipotence will assuredly reveal it in this day, pure and cleansed from dross." 

 "lie that par-taketh  of the waters of My Revelation ivill taste all the incorruptible delights ordained by God from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end." "Every single letter proceeding from Our mouth is endowed with such regenerative power as to enable it to bring into existence a new creation — a creation the magnitude  of which is inscrutable to all save God. He verily hath knowledge of all things." 

 "It is in Our power, should We wish it, to enable a speck of floating dust to generate, in less than the twinkling  of an eye, suns of infinite, of unimaginable splendour, to cause a dewdrop to develop into vast and numberless oceans, to infuse into every letter such a force as to empower it to unfold all the knowledge ofpast and future ages." 

 "We are possessed of such power which, if brought to light, will transmute the most deadly of poisons into a panacea of unfailing efficacy." 

 Estimating the station of the true believer He remarks: "By the sorrows which afflict the beauty of the All-Glorious! 

 Such is the station ordained for the true believer that if to an extent smaller than a needle's eye the glory of that station were to be unveiled to mankind, every


<p47>
WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI        47

  beholder would be consumed away in his longing to attain it. For this reason it hath been decreed that in this earthly life the full measure of the glory of his own station should remain conceakd from tize eyes of such a believer." 

 "If the veil be lifted," He similarly affirms, "and the full glory of the station of those who have turned wholly towards God, and in their love for Him renounced the world, be made manifest, the entire creation would be dumbfounded." 

 Stressing the superlative character of His Revelation as compared with the Dispensation preceding it, Baha'u'llah makes the following affirmation: "If all the peoples of the world be invested with the powers and attributes destined for the Letters of the Living, the Bab's chosen disciples, whose station is ten thousand times more glorious than any which the apostles of old have attained, and if they, one and all, should, swift as the twinkling of an eye, hesitate to recognize the light of My Revelation, their faith shall be of no avail and they shall be accounted among the infidels." "So tremendous is the outpouring  of Divine grace in this Dispensation that if mortal hands could be swWt enough to record them, within the space of a single day and night there would stream verses of such number as to be equivaknt to the whole of the Persian Baydn." 

 "Give heed to my warning,ye people ofPersia,' He thus addresses His countrymen, "if I be slain at your hands, God will assuredly raise up one who will fill the seat made vacant through my death; for such is God's method carried into effect of old, and no change can ye find in God's mode of dealing." "Should they attempt to conceal  His light on the continent, He will assuredly rear His head in the midmost heart of the ocean and, raising His voice, proclaim: 'I am the life-giver  of the world!'.. And i/they cast Him into a darksome pit, they will find Him seated on earth',v loftiest heights calling aloud to all mankind:  'ho, the Desire c/the world is come in Hiv majesty, His sovereignty, His transcendent domi-nionj~  And if He be buried beneath the depths of the earth, His Spirit soaring to the apex of heaven shall peal the summons: 'Behold ye the coming of the Glory; witness ye the Kingdom of God, the most Holy, the Gracious, the All-Powerful!"'  "Within the throat of this Youth," is yet another astounding statement, "there lie prisoned accents which, if revealed to mankind to an extent .rnwller than a needle's eye, would suffice to cause every mountain to crumble, the leaves of the trees to be discoloured and their fruits to fall; would compel every head to bow down in worship and every face to turn in adoration  towards this omnipotent Ruler Who, at sundry times and in diverse manners, appearetli as a devouring flame, as a billowing ocean, as a radiant light, as the tree which, rooted in the soil of holiness, lifteth its branches and .vpreadetli out its limbs as far as and beyond the throne of deathless glory." 

 Anticipating the System    

 which the irresistible power of His Law was destined to unfold in a later age, He writes: "The world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind's  ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed." 

 "The Hand of Omnipotence hath established His Revelation upon an unassailable, an enduring foundation. 

 Storms of human strife are powerless to undermine its basis, nor will men's fanciful theories succeed in damaging its structure." 

 In the St~ratu'I-Haykal, one of the most challenging works of Baha'u'llah, the following verses, each of which testifies to the resistless power infused into the Revelation proclaimed by its Author, have been recorded: "Naught is seen in My temple but the Temple of God, and in My beauty but His Beauty, and in My being but His Being, and in My se If but His Self, and in My movement but His Movement, and in My acquiescence but His Acquiescence, and in My pen hut His Pen, the Mighty, the All-Praised. There bath not been in My soul but the Truth, and in Myself naught could be seen but 

God." "The Holy Spirit     

 Itself hath been generated through the agency of a single letter revealed by this 

Most Great Spirit, 'if     
ye be of them that comprehend."... 

 "Within the treasury of Our Wisdom  there lies unrevealed a knowledge, one word of which, if we chose to divulge it to mankind, would cause every human being to recognize the Manifestation of God and to acknowledge His omniscience, would enable every one to discover the secrets of all the sciences, and to attain so high a station as to find himself wholly independent  of all past and future learning. Other knowledges We do as well possess, not a single letter of which We can disclose, nor do We find humanity able to hear even the barest reference

 to their meaning. Thus have We informed you of the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise."  "The day is approaching when God will have, by an act of His Will, raised up a race of men the nature of which is inscrutable to all save God, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting." "He will, ere long, out of the Bosom of Power draw forth the Hands of Ascendancy and Might — Hands who will arise to win victory for this Youth and who will purge mankind from the defilement of the outcast and the ungodly. 

 These Hands will gird up their loins to champion the Faith of God, and will, in My name the Self-subsistent,  the Mighty, subdue the peoples and kindreds of the earth. 

 They will enter the cities and will inspire with fear the hearts of all their inhabitants. 

 Such are the evidences of the might of God; how fearful, how vehement is His might!" 

 Such is, dearly-beloved friends, Baha'u'llah's own written testimony to the nature of His Revelation. 

 To the affirmations of the BTh, each of which reinforces the strength, and confirms  the truth, of these remarkable statements, I have already referred. 

 What remains for me to consider in this connection are such passages in the writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the appointed Interpreter of these same utterances, as throw further light upon and amplify various features of this enthralling theme. The tone of His language is indeed as emphatic and His tribute no less glowing than that of either iBah~'u'11Th or the Bib. 

 'Centuries, nay ages, must pass away," He affirms in one of His earliest Tablets, "ere the Daystar of Truth shineth again in its midsummer  splendour, or appeareth once more in the radiance of its vernal glory... How thankful must we be for having been made in this Day the recipients of so overwhelming a favour! Would that we had ten thousand lives that we might lay them down in thanksgiving for so rare aprivilege, so high an attainment, so priceless a bounty!" "The mere contemplation," He adds, "of the Dispensation inaugurated by the Blessed Beauty would have sufficed to overwhelm the saints of bygone ages — saints who longed to partake for one moment of its great glory." 

 "The holy ones of past ages and centuries have, each and all, yearned with tearful eyes to live, though for one moment, in the Day of God. Their longings unsatisfied, they repaired to the Great Beyond. How great, therefore, is the bounty of the Abhd Beauty Who, notwithstanding our utter unworthiness, bath through His grace and mercy breat bed into us in this divinely-illumined century the spirit of life, hath gathered us beneath the standard of the Beloved of the world, and chosen to confer upon us a bounty/or which the mighty ones of bygone ages had craved in vain." 

 "The souls of the well-favoured among the concourse on high," He likewise affirms, "the sacred dwellers of the most exalted Paradise, are in this day filled with burning desire to return unto this world, that they may render such service as lieth in their power to the threshold of the Ablid Beauty." 

 "The effulgence of God's splendrous mercy," He, in a passage alluding to the growth and future development of the Faith, declares, "hath enveloped the peoples and kindreds of the earth, and the whole world is bathed in its shining glory.. 

 The day will soon come when the light of Divine unity will have so permeated the East and the West that no man dare any longer ignore it." "Now in the world of being the Hand of divine power hath firmly laid the foundations of this all-highest bounty and this wondrous gift. Whatsoever is latent in the innermost of this holy cycle shall gradually appear and be made manifest, for now is but the beginning of its growth and the dayspring of the revelation of its signs. Ere the close of this century and of this age, it shall be made clear and evident how wondrous was that springtide and how heavenly was that gift!" 

 In confirmation of the exalted rank of the true believer, referred to by Baha'u'llah, He reveals the following: "The station which he who hath truly recognized this Revelation will attain is the same as the one ordained for such prophets of the house of Israel as are not regarded as Manifestations 'endowed with constancy"' In connection with the Manifestations destined to follow the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha makes this definite and weighty declaration: "Concerning the Manifestations that will come down in the future 'in the shadows of the clouds,' know verily that in so far as their relation to the source of their inspiration is concerned they are under the shadow of the Ancient Beauty. 

 In their relation, however, to the age in which they appear, each and every one of them 'doeth whatsoever He willeth."' "0 my friend!" He thus addresses in one of

50                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 His Tablets a man of recognized authority and standing, "The undying Fire which the Lord of the Kingdom bath kindled in the midst of the holy Tree is burning fiercely in the midmost heart of the world. The conflagration it will provoke will envelop the whole earth. Its blazing flames will illuminate its peoples and kindreds. 

 All the signs have been revealed; every prophetic allusion hat/i been manifested. 

 Whatever hath been enshrined in all the Scriptures of the past hath been made evident. 

 To doubt or hesitate is no more possible.  Time is pressing. The Divine Charger is impatient, and can tarry no longer. Ours is the duty to rush forward and, ere it is too late, win the victory." And finally, is this most stirring passage which He, in one of His moments of exultation, was moved to address to one of His most trusted and eminent followers in the earliest days of His ministry: "What more shall Isay? What else can my pen recount? So loud is the call that reverbe rates from the Abhd Kingdom that mortal ears are well-nigh deafened with its vibrations. 

 The whole creation, met hinks, is being disrupted and is bursting asunder through the shattering influence of the Divine summons issued from the throne of glory. More than this I cannot write." 
    Dearly-beloved friends!    

 Enough has been said, and the quoted excerpts from the Writings of the Bin, of Baha'u'llah and of 'Abdu'l-Baha are sufficiently numerous and varied, to convince  the conscientious reader of the sublimity of this unique cycle in the world's religious history. 

 It would be utterly impossible to over-exaggerate  its significance or to overrate the influence it has exerted and which it must increasingly exert as its great system unfolds itself amidst the welter of a collapsing civilization. 

 To whoever may read these pages a word of warning seems, however, advisable before I proceed further with the development of my argument. Let no one meditating, in the light of the aforequoted passages, on the nature of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, mistake its character or misconstrue the intent of its Author. 

 The divinity attributed to so great a Being and the complete incarnation of the names and attributes of God in so exalted a Person should, under no circumstances, be misconceived or misinterpreted. 

 The human temple that has been made the vehicle of so overpowering a Revelation must, if we be faithful ful to the tenets of our Faith, ever remain entirely distinguished from that "innermost Spirit of Spirits" and "eternal Essence of Essences" — that invisible yet rational God Who, however much we extol the divinity of His Manifestations on earth, can in no wise incarnate His infinite, His unknowable, His incorruptible and all-embracing Reality in the concrete and limited frame of a mortal being. Indeed, the God Who could so incarnate His own reality would, in the light of the teachings of Baha'u'llah, cease immediately to be God. So crude and fantastic a theory of Divine incarnation  is as removed from, and incompatible with, the essentials of Baha'i belief as are the no less inadmissible pantheistic and anthropomorphic conceptions of God — both of which the utterances of Baha'u'llah emphatically  repudiate and the fallacy of which they expose. 

 lie Who in unnumbered passages claimed His utterance to be the "Voice of Divinity, the Call of God Himself" thus solemnly affirms in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn: "To every discerning and illumined heart it is evident that God, the unknowable  Essence, the Divine Being, is immeasurably exalted beyond every human attn-bute  such as corporeal existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress... 

 He is, and hath ever been, veiled in the ancient eternity of His Essence, and will remain in His Reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men... He standeth exalted beyond and above all separation and union, all proximity and remoteness. 

 'God was alone; there was none else beside Him' is a sure testimony of this truth." 

 "From time immemorial,"Bah~'u'116~h, speaking  of God, explains, "He, the Divine Being, hath been veiled in the ineffable sanctity of His exalted Self, and will everlastingly continue to be wrapt in the impenetrable mystery of His unknowable  Essence. 

 Ten thousand Prophets, each a Moses, are thunderstruck upon the Sinai of their search at God's forbidding voice, ~Thou shah never behold Me!', whilst a myriad Messengers,  each as great as Jesus, stand dismayed upon their heavenly thrones by the interdiction 'Mine Essence thou shalt never apprehend!"' "How bewildering to me, insignificant as I am," Baha'u'llah in His communion with God affirms, "is the attempt to fathom the sacred depths of Thy knowledge! How futile my efforts to visualize the magnitude of the power inherent

WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI        51

 in Thine handiwork — the revelation of Thy creative power!" "When I contemplate, 0 my God, the relationship that bindeth me to Thee," He, in yet another prayer revealed in His own handwriting, testifies, "I anz moved to proclaim to all created things 'verily lam God!'; and when I consider my own sell; lo, I find it coarser than clay!" 

 "The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days," Baha'u'llah further states in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn, "being thus closed in the face of all beings, He, the Source of infinite grace.. 

 hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of/lie realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the human temple, and be made manifest unto all men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the unchangeable Being and tell of the subtleties of His imperishable Essence. 
All the Prophets of God,   

His well-favoured,  His    

 holy and chosen Messengers are, without exception, the bearers of His names and the embodiments of 

His attributes. These Tabernacles

 of Holiness, these primal Mirrors which reflect the Light of unfading glory, are but expressions of Him Who is the Invisible of the Invisibles." 

 That Baha'u'llah should, notwithstanding the overwhelming intensity of His Revelation, be regarded as essentially one of these Manifestations of God, never to be identified with that invisible Reality, the Essence of Divinity itself, is one of the major beliefs of our Faith —  a belief which should never be obscured and the integrity of which no one of its followers should allow to be compromised. 

 Nor does the Baha'i Revelation, claiming as it does to be the culmination of a prophetic cycle and the fulfilment of the promise of all ages, attempt, under any circumstances, to invalidate those first and everlasting principles that animate and underlie the religions that have preceded it. The God-given authority, vested in each one of them, it admits and establishes as its firmest and ultimate basis. It regards them in no other light except as different stages in the eternal history and constant evolution of one religion, Divine and indivisible of which it itself forms but an integral part. It neither seeks to obscure their Divine origin, nor to dwarf the admitted magnitude of their colossal achievements. 

 It can countenance no attempt that seeks to distort their features or to stultify the truths which they instill. Its teachings ings do not deviate a hairbreadth from the verities they enshrine, nor does the weight of its message detract one jot or one tittle from the influence they exert or the loyalty they inspire. Far from aiming at the overthrow of the spiritual foundation of the world's religious systems, its avowed, its unalterable purpose is to widen their basis, to restate their fundamentals,  to reconcile their aims, to reinvigorate their life, to demonstrate their oneness, to restore the pristine purity of their teachings, to coordinate their functions and to assist in the realization of their highest aspirations. 

 These divinely-revealed religions, as a close observer has graphically expressed it, "are doomed not to die, but to be reborn... 'Does not the child succumb in the youth and the youth in the man; yet neither child nor youth perishes?"' "They Who are the Luminaries of Truth and the Mirrors reflecting the light of Divine Unity," Baha'u'llah explains in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn, "in whatever age and cycle they are sent down from their invisible habitations of ancient glory unto this world to educate the souls of men and endue with grace all created things, are invariably endowed with an all-compelling power and invested  with invincible sovereignty. 

 These sanctified Mirrors, these Daysprings of ancient glory are one and all the exponents on earth of Him Who is the central Orb of the universe, its essence and ultimate purpose. 

 From Him proceed  their knowledge and power; from Him is derived their sovereignty. The beauty of their countenance is but a reflection of His image, and their revelation a sign of His deathless glory. 

 Through them is transmitted a grace that is infinite, and by them is revealed the light that can neverfade... 

 Human tongue can never befittingly sing their praise, and human speech can never unfold their mystery." "Inasmuch as these Birds of the celestial Throne," He adds, "are all sent down from the heaven of the Will of God, and as they all arise to proclaim His irresistible Faith, they therefore are regarded as one soul and the same person. They all abide in the same tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are seated upon the same throne, utter the same speech, and proclaim the same Faith.. They only differ in the intensity of their revelation and the conwara-tive  potency of their light. That a certain attribute of God hath not been outwardly manifested  by these Essences of Detachment doth in no wise imply that they Who are the Daysprings


<p52>
52                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 of God's attributes and the Treasuries of His holy names did not actually possess it." It should also be borne in mind that, great as is the power manifested by this Revelation and however vast the range of the 

Dispensation its Author   

 has inaugurated, it emphatically repudiates  the claim to be regarded as the final revelation of God's will and purpose for mankind.  To hold such a conception of its character and functions would be tantamount to a betrayal of its cause and a denial of its truth. 

 It must necessarily conflict with the fundamental principle which constitutes the bedrock of Baha'i belief, the principle that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation  is orderly, continuous and progressive and not spasmodic or final. 

 Indeed, the categorical rejection by the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah of the claim to finality which any religious system inaugurated by the Prophets of the past may advance is as clear and emphatic as their own refusal to claim that same finality for the Revelation with which they stand identified. 

 "To believe that all revelation is ended, that the portals of Divine mercy are closed, that from the daysprings of eternal holiness  no sun shall rise again, that the ocean of everlasting bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the tabernacle of ancient glory the Messengers of God have ceased to be made manifest" must constitute in the eyes of every follower of the Faith a grave, an inexcusable departure from one of its most cherished and fundamental principles. 

 A reference to some of the already quoted utterances of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. will surely suffice to establish, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the truth of this cardinal principle. Might not the following passage of The Hidden Words be, likewise, construed as an allegorical allusion to the progressiveness of Divine Revelation and an admission by its Author that the Message with which He has been entrusted is not the final and ultimate expression of the will and guidance of the Almighty? "0 Son ofJustice!In the night season the beauty of the immortal Being hath repaired from the emerald height of fidelity unto the Sadratu'l-Muntahd, and wept with such a weeping  that the concourse on high and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at His lamenting. Whereupon there was asked, Why the wailing and weeping? 

 He made reply: As bidden I waited expectant upon the hill of faithfulness, yet inhaled  not from them that dwell on earth the fragrance offidelity. Then summoned to return I beheld, and lolcertain doves of holiness were sore tried within the claws of the dogs of earth. Thereupon  the Maid of heaven hastened forth unveiled  and resplendent from Her mystic mansion, and asked of their names, and all were told but one. 

 And when urged, the first letter thereof was uttered, whereupon the dwellers of the celestial chambers rushed forth out of their habitation of glory. And whilst the second letter was pronounced  they fell down, one and all, upon the dust. At that moment a voice was heard from the inmost shrine: 'Thus far and no farther.' 

 Verily We bear witness to that which they have done and now are doing." 

 In a more explicit language Baha'u'llah testifies to this truth in one of His Tablets revealed in Adrianople: "Know verily that the veil hiding Our countenance bath not been completely  lifted. 

 We have revealed Our Self to a degree corresponding to the capacity of the people of Our age. Should the Ancient Beauty be unveiled in the fullness of His glory mortal eyes would be blinded by the dazzling intensity of His revelation." 

 In the Si~riy-i-5abr, revealed as far back as the year 1863, on the very first day of His arrival in the garden of Ri~Iv~n, He thus affirms: "God hath sent down His Messengers to succeed to Moses and Jesus, and He will continue to do so till 'the end that hath no end'; so that His grace may, from the heaven of Divine bounty, be continually vouchsafed to mankind." 

 "I am not apprehensive for My own self," Baha'u'llah still more explicitly declares, "My fears are for Him Who will be sent down unto you after Me — Him Who will be invested with great sovereignty and mighty dominion." 

 And again He writes in the S4ratu'l-Haykal: "By those words which I have revealed, Myself is not intended, but rather He Who will come after Me. To it is witness God, the All-Knowing." "Deal not with Him," He adds, "as ye have dealt with Me." 

 In a more circumstantial passage the BTh upholds the same truth in His writings. "It is clear and evident," He writes in the Persian Baydn, "that the object of all preceding Dispensations hath been to pave the way for the advent of 

Muhammad, the Apostle     

 of God. These, including the Mui~iarn,nadan Dispensa


<p53>
WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI        53

  tion, have had, in their turn, as their objective the Revelation proclaimed by the Qd'im. The purpose underlying this Revelation, as well as those that preceded it, has, in like manner, been to announce the advent of the Faith of Him Whom God will make manifest. 

 And this Faith — the Faith of Him Whom God will make manifest — in its turn, together  with all the Revelations gone before it, have as their object the Manifestation destined to succeed it. And the latter, no less than all the Revelations preceding it, prepare the way for the Revelation which is yet to follow. The process of the rise and setting of the Sun of Truth will thus indefinitely continue — a process that hath had no beginning and will have no end." 

 "Know of a certainty," Baha'u'llah explains in this connection, "that in every Dispensation the light of Divine Revelation has been vouchsafed  to men in direct proportion to their spiritual capacity. 

 Consider the sun. How feeble its rays the moment it appeareth above the horizon. How gradually its warmth and potency increase as it approacheth its zenith, enabling meanwhile all created things to adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light. How steadily it declines until it reacheth its setting point. Were it all of a sudden  to manifest the energies latent within it, it would no doubt cause injury to all created things. ... 

 In like manner, i/the Sun of Truth were suddenly to reveal, at the earliest stages of its manifestation, the full measure of the potencies which the providence of the Almighty hath bestowed upon it, the earth of human understanding would waste away and be consumed; for men's hearts would neither sustain the intensity of its revelation,  nor be able to mirror forth the radiance of its light. 

 Dismayed and overpowered, they would cease to exist." 

 In the light of these clear and conclusive statements it is our clear duty to make it indubitably evident to every seeker after truth that from "the beginning that hath no begin-fling"  the Prophets of the one, the unknowable God, including Baha'u'llah Himself, have all, as the channels of God's grace, as the exponents of His unity, as the mirrors of His light and the revealers of His purpose, been commissioned to unfold to mankind an ever-increasing measure of His truth, of His inscrutable will and Divine guidance, and will continue to "the end that hath no end" to vouchsafe still fuller and mightier revelations of His limitless power and glory. 

 We might well ponder in our hearts the following passages from a prayer revealed by Baha'u'llah which strikingly affirm, and are a further evidence of, the reality of the great and essential truth lying at the very core of His Message to mankind: "Praise be to Thee, 0 Lord my God, for the wondrous revelations of Thine inscrutable decree and the manifold woes and trials Thou hast destined for myself. 

 At one time Thou didst deliver me into the hands of Nimrod; at another Thou heist allowed Pharaoh's rod to persecute me. Thou alone canst estimate, through Thine all-encompassing knowledge and the operation of Thy Will, the incalculable afflictions I have suffered at their hands. Again Thou didst cast me into the prison-cell of the ungodly for no reason except that I was moved to whisper into the ears of the well-favoured denizens of Thy kingdom an intimation of the vision with which Thou hadst, through Thy knowledge, inspired me and revealed to me its meaning through the potency of Thy might. 

 And again Thou didst decree that I be beheaded by the sword of the infidel. 

 Again I was crucified for having unveiled to men's eyes the hidden gems of Thy glorious unity, for having reveakd to them the wondrous signs of Thy sovereign and everlasting  power. How bitter the humiliations heaped upon me, in a subsequent age, on the plain of Karbild! 

 How lonely did I feel amidst Thy people; to what state of helplessness I was reduced in that land! Unsatisfied with such indignities,  my persecutors decapitated me and carrying aloft my headfrom land to land paraded it before the gaze of the unbelieving multitude and deposited jt on the seats of the perverse and faithless. 

 In a later age I was suspended and my breast was made a target to the darts of the malicious cruelty of my foes. My limbs were riddled with bullets and my body was torn asunder. Finally, behold how in this day my treacherous enemies have leagued themselves against me, and are continually plotting to instil the venom of hate and malice into the souls of Thy servants. With all their might they are scheming to accomplish their purpose. 

 Grievous as is my plight, 0 God, my Well-beloved, I render thanks unto Thee, and my spirit is gratefulfor whatsoever liath befallen me in the path of Thy good-pleasure. 

 lam welipleased with that which Thou didst ordain for me, and welcome, however calamitous, the pains and sorrows I am made to suffer."

THE MOST GREAT JUBILEE

  Report on the Baha'i World Congress held in 'London 

                APRIL 28-MAY  2, 1963

                 B~ BEATRICE ASHTQN

  "The vision now disclosed.., is indeed ent hralling. The tasks which, if that vision is to be fulfilled, must be valiantly shouldered.. are staggering. The time during which so herculean a task is to beperformedis alarmingly brief The period during which so gigantic an operation must be set in motion, prosecuted and consummated, ated, coincides with the critical, and perhaps the darkest and most tragic, stage in human affairs. The opportunities presenting themselves are now close at hand. The invisible battalions of the Concourse on High are mustered, in serried ranks, ready to rush their reinforcements to the aid of the vanguard of Baha'u'llah's ldh's crusaders in the hour of their greatest need, and in anticzpation of that Most Great, that Wondrous Jubilee in the joyfulness of which both heaven and earth will partake...              SHOGHI EFFENDI, November 23, 1951 

THE "Most Great Jubilee"   

 held in London during the closing days of the RiQv~n period celebrated at one and the same time the "King of Festivals" commemorating "the formal assumption by Baha'u'llah of His Prophetic Office"1 one hundred years earlier, at the time of His Declaration in the Garden of RhJv~n in BaghdAd, and the victorious consummation of the "fate-laden, soul-stirring, decade-long, world-embracing Spiritual Crusade"2 which had been inaugurated by the Guardian and had established the Faith of Baha'u'llah on a worldwide basis, closing the first epoch in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 This great centenary of the Declaration of Baha'u'llah marked the second step of three in the unfoldment of His revelation, which, as Shoghi Effendi tells us,8 began with "the first intimation" its Bearer received while a prisoner in chains in the dungeon of the SiyTh-~~1 of Tih6n, an experience commemorated in the Holy Year which preceded the World Crusade. The third step in this process, proclamation, would have its centenary later, in 1967, celebrating the revelation of Baha'u'llah's addresses dresses proclaiming His mission to the rulers and ecciesiastics of the world. 

 The ten years between the centenary of the birth of Baha'u'llah's mission and that commemorating His declaration were filled with the Guardian's Spiritual Crusade of which he had written in the cablegram launching it :~ "Current Baha'i history must henceforth, as second decade of second Baha'i century opens, move rapidly and majestically as it has never moved before since the inception of the Faith over a century ago." 

 The upsurge of activity envisioned in these words of the Guardian was reflected in the World Congress in London, for surely never before had the Faith moved forward so rapidly or so majestically as it had in the ten years of jhis global Crusade. 

 The Jubilee offered the channel for an outpouring of gratitude to Baha'u'llah for His assistance in its triumphant conclusion. 

 It was fitting that London was the place chosen for this joyous Jubilee, after it became evident that it was impossible to hold it in BaghdAd. 

 It was London that had welcomed 'Abdu'l-Baha a little over half a century ago, 57

  Believers from all corners of the globe gathering at the Royal Albert Hall on the opening day of the World Congress. 

  and it was in London that, midway during the Crusade, Shoghi Effendi, beloved Guardian of the Cause of God, had passed away and been laid to rest there, a brief five and a half years before. This was the Guardian's Crusade that was being gloriously concluded in loving tribute to him: he had set its time, he had given its objectives, he had encouraged and honoured its pioneers who went to the ends of the world in obedience to his call and to the exhortations of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, to teach and bring God's healing Message to the hearts of all mankind. 

 The purpose of the Crusade, the Guardian had explained, was to establish, "on a worldwide scale, an unassailable administrative foundation for Baha'u'llah's 

Christ-promised            

 promised Kingdom on earth, swelling thereby the chorus of universal jubilation wherein earth and heaven will join, as prophesied by Daniel, echoed by 'Abdu'l-Baha 'on that day will the faithful rejoice with exceeding gladness.' 

 "~ Now, the "faithful" were indeed rejoicing, in London and throughout the world. 

 Shoghi Effendi had hinted, at the end of a general letter written in 1931, that the hundredth anniversary of the declaration of Baha'u'llah might "mark the inauguration" of the era of "realiza-tion of that Wondrous Vision which constitutes the brightest emanation of His Mind and the fairest fruit of the fairest civilization the world has yet seen."~ Indeed, those present at this

  first Baha'i World Congress felt keenly aware that they were witnessing yet arrnther step in the unfoldment of Baha'u'llah's World Order, the crowning unit of which is the 

Universal House of Justice.

 The nine members of that newly-elected body were in our midst, honoured  participants at this World Congress, with twelve Hands of the Cause of God, who brought to the Congress the nearness of the Guardian's spirit and his presence. In all, more than six thousand Baha'is from all corners and continents of the world converged on the Royal Albert Hall during those joyful days. The gathering of the Baha'is in such numbers appeared  to release a spiritual force that flowed far beyond the confines of the Hall, beyond the confines of London itself. A generation as yet unborn would ask their parents, "Were you there ?" And the answer might be, as one present did answer, "Yes, I was there, but I did not know it." How could one, at this moment in time, realize the significance of this 

Most Great Jubilee?        

 The happy, jubilant Baha, many in native costumes, thronged across Knightsbridge, halting  the traffic on this busy thoroughfare, crowding up the steps of the huge hail, eager to witness the opening of this first 

Baha'i World Congress.     

 The familiar surroundings of London seemed to be of secondary importance as though, in this moment of history, they fulfilled their purpose in serving as a backdrop for the holding of the Most Great Jubilee of the declaration of Baha'u'llah. Nothing in London, nothing in the world, would be the same again. A new era was inaugurated; here was tangible, visible evidence of it! The joy and excitement of the occasion were reflected in the faces of the Baha rushing forward to join their fellow-believers of every race, tongue, colour and nationality. 

 The seasoned veterans of the Guardian's World Crusade and the newly-enrolled from remote lands who were part of the harvest of that globe-girdling enterprise triumphantly gathered to celebrate the victories  of the Ten Year Plan and give thanks


<p60>

 to Baha'u'llah for His merciful assistance. Inside the great hail the deep, warm voice of Enoch Olinga, beloved early African believer and pioneer who had been elevated to the rank of Hand of the Cause by Shoghi Effendi, was drawing the attention of the friends. The Baha'is were seated, tier on tier, to the roof, in a wide circle. The speakers' platform was accented with colourful floral arrangements and Persian rugs. Simultaneous translation was provided in Persian, 

German, French and Spanish 

 by shifts of translators housed in booths in the top balcony, though specially equipped earphones available to all who desired this service. 

        FIRST DAY                  

 The opening session had for its theme "The Day of Victory". After prayers in Persian and English and the reading of excerpts from the Tablet of Ridvan in English, the chairman read the historic cablegram of April 22, 19 63* from the Hands of the Cause to the entire Baha'i world announcing the results of the election of the members of the Universal House of Justice at the first Baha'i World Convention, One's mind could not grasp the significance of this announcement, but the spirit could, and did, rejoice. This was the Universal House of Justice called into being by Baha'u'llah and * For text of cablegram, see p. 425 of this volume.

 described by Shoghi Effendi as the "last refuge of a tottering civi1ization",~ the "supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth" of the futureA These were its first members, here with us! They would be officially presented at a later point in the Congress programme. 

 Before introducing the first speaker for the opening session, the chairman, Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga, "with a heart full of joy and gladness", greeted and welcomed the assembled friends and paid tribute to Baha'u'llah and the Rib for the glories of this day. In concluding his remarks he said: "May the blessings of Baha'u'llah be with us all and enable us to fully appreciate the greatness ness of His Station and of this Day, so that we may, when we return to our respective homes and countries, make use of the dynamic forces which have been released during this time, forces which will enable the Faith of God to traverse the plains of obscurity, of repression, of emancipation and recognition as a State religion, a stage which, in the words of our beloved Guardian, 'will signalize the long-awaited advent of the Christ-promised Kingdom  of God on earth — the Kingdom of Baha'u'llah...', which in its turn is to signalize 'the birth of a world civilization..

  View of the platform at the World Congress from one of the upper tiers of the 

                 Royal Albert Hall.

  The first of three speakers at this session was the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha 

Ri~iyyih KhAnum. After    

 referring to the many titles by which Baha'u'llah had been designated, cited by Shoghi Effendi from the sacred Writings of many Faiths, she spoke of Baha'u'llah's blessings flowing into the world at this time, like waves one after another, from the Most Great Ocean. 

 She reviewed very briefly some highlights of what Shoghi Effendi did for us during the thirty-six years of his ministry: how he reminded us of the standards to be upheld by those who go forth to teach, and how in the last ten years we had seen the results of the response to his call. At the Baha World Centre he completed the Shrine of the BTh, raised the International Archives Building and laid out the gardens on Mt. Carmel and at Baha, where they beautify the area around the Tomb of Baha'u'llah. He appointed twenty-seven Hands of the Cause of God and strengthened this Institution by giving it Auxiliary Boards for teaching and protection of the Faith. 

 He appointed  the International Baha'i Council as forerunner of the Universal House of Justice and guided it to enhance the prestige of the 

Faith in Israel. Abdu'l-Baha

 Rfiljiyyib KhAnum then gave a statistical review of the great progress made in establishing the Faith and its institutions during the last ten years, the period of the World Crusade. She concluded with saying: "We cannot slacken the pace, particularly at this moment when we have elected the crowning  institution of the Baha world. Underneath it there must be strong pillars, the National Spiritual Assemblies. Those pillars must rest on strong Local 

Spiritual Assemblies.     

 The Assemblies  must be composed of enlightened, strong and enthusiastic believers. 

 We must create new Assemblies throughout the world. And all of this depends upon the spirit of the Baha'is, upon their eagerness and willingness to serve and, above all, upon their faith in Baha'u'llah. 

 He has promised that He will always help those who arise to serve Him, and I am sure that the believers in this room and their fellow-believers all over the world arc going to face the future now with a fresh determination to win even more marvellous victories than have been won in the past. This is the way we show our love for Baha'u'llah, our love for

  'Abdu'l-Baha and our gratitude for the bounty of the Divine Plan; and this is how we demonstrate our love for our Guardian, who wore himself out and burned himself up in leading the way and showing us how we could go forward and what we must do. 

 I am sure that every Baha is going to do his utmost in the years to come.~~ The other two speakers at the opening session were the Hands of the Cause 'Ali-Alkbar Fur6tan and Ijasan Baha'i. Mr. Furi~tan cited some prophecies from the Holy Books of many Faiths  pointing to this day, that have been fulfilled by the coming of Baha'u'llah. 

 Mr. Baha'i outlined the pattern of crisis and victory in the history of the Baha'i Faith that has propelled us towards this day of victory. We know that other crusades are to follow, he said, but "none can ever be more precious, more dear to the hearts of the Baha'is, than the one we have concluded, because it was the Crusade launched by our beloved Shoghi 

Effendi."                  

 Brief but intensive consideration was given to the Mission of Baha'u'llah, to the Divine Plan of 'Abdu'l-Baha and its unfoldment under the guidance of the Guardian in the successive plans initiated by him, and to the spiritual significance and administrative importance of the World Centre of the Faith with the newly-elected 

Universal House of Justice 

 as its supreme unit. The programme then revolved around our sacred duty of teaching the Faith, in the opening of new territories and enrollment of the masses. 

 The chairman of a later session, Mr. 'Au Nakhjav&nf, summarized our course: "From praise, from thanksgiving, from glorification,  from applause to the field of action." The final session was in tribute to our beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, and his thirty-six years of intensely active, wise and farseeing leadership of the Cause of God. 
                           
        SECOND DAY                 

 The morning session, with the Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llAh Kh&lem as chairman, had for its theme "The Mission of Baha'u'llah". There were three speakers: Auxiliary 

Board member Marion Hofman 

 of England, Amoz Gibson, newly-elected member of the Universal House of Justice and the Hand of the Cause TarAzu'lhh Samandari. In the afternoon the


<p64>
64                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Ridvan Feast was held, celebrating the ninth day of RiQvAn. 

 After prayers in Turkish, Chinese, Swahili and Arabic, Mr. KMdem spoke a few words filled with the love of Baha'u'llah. Marion Hofman, whose address was on "The Promise of All Ages' cited passages from the Writings of Baha'u'llah referring to this Day, when "He, the Ancient of everlasting days is come, girded with majesty and power."lo Amoz Gibson, in his address on "The Blessed Beauty", cited many evidences in the world today of the 

Spirit of Baha'u'llah      

 at work, though the people of the world are as yet unaware that His sufferings from the injustices and hardships inflicted on Him were those of "the Divine Educator which shortened the afflictions of human beings on this planet" and gave them the strength to build His new creation.  "Evidences of the emerging new world are all around us," Mr. Gibson said. 

    The Hand of the Cause TarAzu'llAh

 Saman-dad  was introduced by Mr. KMdem as the one whom Baha'u'llah "held in store for this Most Great Jubilee as a gift to us, the precious soul who belongs to the oldest family which starts from the time of Shayijft A1jmad~i~A~s~j,"* and as "one of the few souls who met Baha' u -11Th." 

 Mr. KMdem said: "I don't know how to call him. The Blessed Beauty called him TarAz Effendi. The Centre of the Covenant called him Mirza Tardz. 

 Our beloved Guardian called him JinAb-i-Samandari. 

 He dedicated all his life to the service of his Beloved." 

 Jin&b-i-Samandari's resonant voice, welling up from his frail body, gave evidence of the strength of his spirit. His remarks in Persian were translated by Marzieh Gail as he spoke. He told about being in the presence of Baha'u'llah three times during the six months he was in 'Akka as a young man of sixteen. 

 That was in 1891 — 1892. One time was on the first day of Rh3vAn in the room at Baha'i "that you all know" who have been to Baha'i Another time was in a garden at Nawruz. "There were poets there that day and one of them was the historian, the great Nabil" (author of The Dawn-Breakers). 

 Baha'u'llah was revealing Tablets in another room, "and I heard the Tablets being chanted," Mr. Samandari said. Later they were in a garden with Baha'u'llah, and the young Samandari walked from the garden to Baha in * See The Dawn-Breakers, p. 42; God Passes By, p. 92. 

 His presence, "while a little rain was falling.~~ "This was one of the great honours that came my way on that day." 

 A week before Baha'u'llah ascended, the young Samandari was one of those present in the Mansion at Baha when they were called into 

His presence. Baha'u'llah  
was very weak and in bed.  

 "He was reading those verses of the Most Holy Book which tell about His ascen-.......  And weak as He was, He spoke. He mentioned this many times: be one and be united. Unity, avoidance of all discord, steadfastness. 

 Those were the three words He emphasized that day," JinAb-i-Samandari told us. For the celebration of the RkIvAn Feast, held in the same hail as the Congress sessions, Luis deFretes, Auxiliary Board member from the Netherlands, was chairman. After prayers the Tablet of J?idvdn was chanted in Persian. Passages selected by the Guardian from the Writings of Baha'u'llah referring to this day, included in his essay The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah were read in English. There were prayers in many languages and a selection of songs sung by the friends from Africa to close the Feast of RhJvAn. 
                           
         THIRD DAY                  

 The morning session of the third day of the Congress, Tuesday, April 30, was devoted to consideration of "The Unfoldment of the Divine Plan" of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 The chairman, H. Borrah Kavelin, newly-elected member of the Universal House of Justice, pointed out: "In the opening days of this glorious historic Congress all of us laid our hearts at the feet of the Blessed Perfection. This morning we do no less we lay our hearts at the feet of the beloved and revered Master and our best-beloved 

Shoghi Effendi."           
     The first speaker, Rowland 

Estall, Auxiliary Board    

 member from Canada and a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of that country,  recalled that, as a boy, he had been taken to the Royal Albert Hall to hear Handel's Messiah. He cited passages from that great oratorio that had special dramatic impact for him now, passages referring to Baha'u'llah and to the reign of the King of kings, linking these passages  with the Words of Baha'u'llah addressed to the kings of the earth as vassals, and to the


<p65>
THE MOST GREAT JUBILEE          65

  The Hand of the Cause Tardzu'!ldh Samandari, who thrice attained the presence of Baha'u'llah Ii, addressed the Congress on April29. 

  Pope. He then outlined the progressive steps in the release of the spiritual forces set in motion by Baha'u'llah through the Divine Plan of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the guidance of Shoghi Effendi in his letters and in the successive teaching plans instituted by him. 

 Mr. Estall read passages from The Advent of Divine Justice's in which Shoghi Effendi gives the "spiritual prerequisites of success" for all teaching work. 

 He then outlined the accomplishments  under the first Seven Year Plan in North and South America, and the second Seven Year Plan in Europe, through which a basis was laid for future development of the Cause. "The friends had arisen to teach," said Mr. Estall. "The lessons of love and unity had, however haltingly, been learned. The purpose for which the Administrative Order had been developed was being served. The supreme mission of Baha'u'llah, the achievement of the organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, was, however, still far off. But at least we were a little closer. 

    Jan Sijsling, Auxiliary    

 Board member from the Netherlands and a member of that country's  National Spiritual Assembly, spoke on "The Vision of 'Abdu'l-Baha" and in his address dress traced the development of the Cause in Europe during the second Seven Year Plan, through the arrival there of teachers and pioneers,  the establishment of Local Spiritual Assemblies, first in the capital cities, through translation of the Writings into native languages,  through teaching conferences, summer schools, the purchase of national headquarters (Hazfratu'1-Quds), and through loyalty to the Covenant, sacrifice and enduring steadfastness. 

 The last address on Tuesday morning was given by Jan Semple, newly-elected member of the Universal 

House of Justice. The      

 chairman explained that the Hand of the Cause Leroy C. Joas was, through serious illness, prevented from addressing the Congress on "Unparalleled Achievements under the Infallible 

Guidance of Shoghi Effendi"

 and that Mr. Semple would speak on the same subject. 

 Mr. Semple first paid tribute to the great self-sacrifices  of the Hands of the Cause and commented  that "this is the first religion in human history which has spread following the passing of its Founder under the continuing guidance of God." lie pointed out that "the way that our beloved Guardian tackled the tasks that lay before him" was an example of how we should


<p66>
66                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 carry on our administrative and teaching work. He read passages from The 

Advent of Divine Justice'4 

 describing the condition of the world, and he related that, while in the Guardian's presence, he had felt that Shoghi Effendi "was fully aware of every shortcoming of the person who stood before him but he was interested oniy in whatever small virtues that person might possess. These he would seize; these he would foster; these he would encourage. This I believe is what he has done with the whole Baha world." 

 The instructions of the Guardian  were truly "the commands of God to His army. 

 It is God who is uniting the world. He knows the work we have to do, and He knows when it must be done. And this we can see again and again, looking back on the instructions of our beloved Guardian and seeing the fruits which result from obedience to these instructions." 

 Comparative statistics were then cited by Mr. Semple illustrating the phenomenal growth of the Faith under the Guardian's guidance. 

 The moment had come for presentation of the Kinghts of Baha'u'llah, those valiant souls who had answered the Guardian's call and pioneered to the ends of the earth. 

 H. Borra.h Kavelin, chairman of the session, read from the Guardian's cablegram announcing the illuminated Roll of Honour that was to bear the names of these Knights and be placed at the entrance door of the inner sanctuary of the Tomb of Baha'u'llah, "as a permanent memorial of the contribution by the champions of His Baha'i "Happily there are too many to be presented individually," the chairman said, but row upon row they sat, behind the speakers' platform, as the thousands attending the Congress poured out their love and gratitude to them in spontaneous waves of sustained applause. 

 How we loved them; they had brought the Guardian joy! 

 The drama of this session was climaxed with the reading, by Dr. 'Aziz Navidi, of a message to the Congress from the Baha'is imprisoned in Morocco, and by a tape-recorded chanting of prayers sent by them. The African singers then led us all in singing AI1Ah-u-AbhA, our voices reverent and tear-choked, our hearts turning to our imprisoned brothers, or absent family. 

 "The World Centre of the Faith" was the subject for the afternoon session of the third day. The spirit had been building up and now it seemed that it would burst the very walls of the huge old building. Indeed, the spirit was not contained within the Royal Albert Hall. Baha'is were all over London, joyously meeting one another everywhere, in restaurants, on the streets, in the city's famous "tube". Photographs  were appearing in the newspapers, with headlines; numerous inquiries were made of the Baha wherever they gathered; spontaneous "curbside" teaching abounded; London's  staid indifference seemed to melt through the contagion of our glee. 

 But who really recognized the significance of the World Congress? Who was really aware that these happy thousands were the harbingers of the new world, were celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of its beginning, were united by bonds deeper than any man had devised, and were, even now, hurrying into the Hall eager to greet the first members of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme administrative institution raised up by the Pen of Baha'u'llah At last the Universal House of Justice had been established, with its seat at the World Centre of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, on Mt. Carmel, the Mountain of God — the first God-guided, truly international body in the history of mankind! The Baha'is struggled to grasp the reality of the moment as they gathered for the afternoon session on that April day. 

 The chairman of the proceedings was Charles Wolcott, newly-elected member of the Universal 

House of Justice. Prayers  

 were said in Italian and Samoan and a message of greeting from the Baha of 'Iraq was read.'6 Mr. Wolcott gave a brief historical background of the "twin cities" of 'Akka and Haifa, the spiritual and administrative centre of the Faith. He then introduced the first of two speakers for this session, Dr. Ugo Giachery, Hand of the Cause of God and former member of the Italo-Swiss 

National Spiritual Assembly. As

 Dr. Giachery had been the Guardian's personal representative for all the work done in Italy for the building of both the superstructure  of the Shine of the Bab and the International Archives Building on Mt. Carmel, he spoke feelingly and knowingly on his subject, "The Unique Spiritual Significance of the World Centre of the Faith". 

 Dr. Giachery explained how it happened that the World Centre came to be in the Hoiy Land "not by


<p67>
THE MOST GREAT JUBILEE           67

 accident" but as "a part of the pattern of the Divine Scheme". He spoke briefly about the construction of the Sepulchre of the Bab during the lifetime of 'Abdu'l-Baha, reminding us that Baha'u'llah Himself, on one of His visits to the Mountain of God, had pointed out to 'Abdu'l-Baha the place where the Shine was to be erected. In the Tablet of Carmel Baha'u'llah, addressing Carmel, says: "Rejoice,for God kwh in this Day established upon thee His throne."'~ Dr. Giarchery spoke also of how the beloved Guardian embarked upon the fulfillment of his wish to honour the three Central Figures of the Faith, Baha'u'llah, the Rib and 'Abdu'l-Baha, and to enhance the prestige of the Faith, by beautification of the Shrines and the areas surrounding them by laying out the gardens at Baha and on Mt. Carmel. 

 The Guardian also, in the development of the spiritual centre of the Faith, created the Monument 

Gardens on Mt. Carmel      

 where rest the remains of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Purest Branch, and the mother of 'Abdu'l-Baha The beauty and sacredness of this area are extolled by Shoghi Effendi in his letter entitled The Spiritual Potencies of That Consecrated Spot.lB In these gardens is laid out the great arc above the tombs of these "thee incomparably precious souls". At the western end of this arc he erected the International Archives Building. Moreover, at Baha'i the Guardian extended the properties and laid out the pattern and enlarged the beautiful gardens there surrounding the Shrine of Baha'u'llah, the Qibllh of the Baha Faith, towards which in the future, Dr. Giachery said, the whole world will turn "for solace, for comfort, for faith". 

 "What Shoghi Effendi accomplished, other men could not have accomplished in centuries," Dr. Giachery stated. "We, too, must have this vision of a far, far, far distant future, of the great victory the Faith is going to experience... That is why our beloved Guardian succeeded." 

 The second speaker at this session was Paul Haney, Hand of the Cause residing in the Holy Land. In his address on "The Supreme 

Administrative  Importance

 of the World Centre" * he quoted many passages from the writings of' Shoghi Effendi, illustrating that the Guardian had carefully prepared the Baha'i world for the establishment of the "world-shaking, world-embracing,  world-directing administrative in* *    For full text of' this address see p.433 of' this volume. 

 stitutions ordained by Baha'u'llah and anticipated by 'Abdu'l-Baha Their focal centre was destined to be "in the vicinity of its world spiritual centre, signalizing the sailing of the Divine Ark on God's mountain, prophesied in the Tablet of Carmet"20 And in January 1951, when the Guardian appointed members of the International Baha Council, "forerunner of the supreme administrative institution~~,21 the Universal House of Justice, destined to be elected "in the fullness of time", he also opened the door to international contributions for the construction of the superstructure of the Shrine of the Rib and the erection of the International 

Archives Building. He      

 laid out the arc, extending eastward from this building, in the Monument Gardens, on which the future edifices would be erected "constituting the 

World Baha'i Administrative

 Centre."22 Thus all was in readiness for the election, at the close of the Ten Year Crusade, of the "last unit crowning the structure of the embryonic World Order of Baha'u'llah the 

Universal House of Justice.

 Earlier in his talk Mr. Haney had pointed out that the Guardian had indicated that the Tablet of Carmel24 was the charter for the development of the institutions of the Faith at its World Centre. 

 Among the many stirring passages quoted by Mr. Haney from the writings of Shoghi Effendi describing the station and function of the House of Justice and the inestimable blessings that would be conferred upon the world when it came into existence was the following:25 "In this great Tablet (of Carmel) which unveils divine mysteries and heralds the establishment of two mighty, majestic and momentous undertakings — one of which is spiritual and the other administrative, both at the World Centre of the Faith — Baha'u'llah refers to an 'Ark', whose dwellers are the men of the Supreme House of Justice, which, in conformity with the exact provisions of the Will and Testament of the Centre of the Mighty Covenant is the Body which should legislate on laws not explicitly  revealed in the Text. In this Dispensation, these laws are destined to flow from this Holy Mountain, even as in the Mosaic Dispensation, the Law of God was promulgated from Zion. The 'sailing of the Ark' of His laws is a reference to the establishment of the Universal House of Justice." 

 Mr. Haney then briefly reported what had


<p68>

  The members of the first Universal House of Justice stood befrre the World Congress while Mr. David Hofman read the first statement of the newly-elected Institution. The Hand of the Cause Paul Haney is seated in the foreground. 

  just taken place at the historic first Inter-nationalBahA'i Convention held in Haifa when, on April 21, 1963, at the House of the Master, the members of the fifty-six 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 of the Baha'i world elected the Universal House of Justice. In describing this first Baha'i World Convention Mr. Haney said that the unique manner in which the election was conducted set a pattern for the world to marvel at and, in the future, to follow. 

 Mr. Haney then presented to the Congress the individual members of this newly-elected Universal House of Justice, while the friends rose and joyously applauded, able but dimly to realize the significance and greatness of this moment. 
The elected members were:  

Charles Wolcott            
'Au NaKhjav~ni             
H. Borrah Kavelin          
Tan Semple                 
Lutfu'11Th Ijakim          
David llofman              

Hugh Chance                
Amoz Gibson                
Hushmand Fatheazam         

 As their names were mentioned, each member  stepped forward until all nine members stood together before the Congress.26 The first statement27 from the Universal House of Justice was then read by David Ilofman.* The message opened with an excerpt from a prayer of praise revealed by Baha'u'llah. Then the various steps were mentioned that made possible the attainment of the crowning victory celebrated by this Most Great Jubilee, with "grateful thanks to Baha'u'llah for all His bounties showered upon the friends throughout the world." And humble tribute was paid to the Hands of the Cause of God ". for they share the victory with their beloved commander, he who raised them up and appointed  them. They kept the ship on its course and brought it safe to port." 

 Then, "with all the love and gratitude of our hearts" was acknowledged  "the reality of the sacrifice, the labour, the self-discipline, the superb stewardship of the Hands of the Cause of God." The message concluded: "The Universal House of Justice greets you all lovingly and joyfully * For full text see p.431 of this volume.

THE MOST GREAT JUBILEE          69

 at this time, and asks you to pray fervently for its speedy development and the spiritual strengthening of its members." 
                          
      PUBLIC MEETING            

 On the evening of the third day of the Congress a meeting open to the public was held in the 

Royal Albert Hall. The    

 subject was "World Unity with Security". There were two speakers, Philip }Iainsworth, member of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Central and East Africa, and William B. S&irs, Hand of the Cause in Africa. 

 John Long, member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles, served as chairman. Both speakers presented  the simple spiritual truths enshrined in the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 Mr. Hainsworth emphasized the great redemptive plan of God for the development of man's soul. Just as a seed holds within itself the potentiality to grow but cannot of itself realize that potential, needing the effect of the sun, so the soul of man needs the Sun of Truth, the Word of God, in order to develop as its Creator intends it should. "It is the response to this challenge," the speaker said, "that produces civilizations." 

 So also, the oniy power of unity in the world comes from the Word of God, for God is one eternally. 

 Thus the unity of mankind is and has been since the creation of man; what is now necessary is that man recognize this fact and help establish a society that will reflect this unity. 

 This is what Baha'u'llah came to do. It is "this tremendous spiritual outpouring of Baha'u'llah that can find its response in the soul of every single human being", whether in Africa or in the most sophisticated metropolis, Mr. Hainsworth said. 

 The Hand of the Cause William Sears, in his address, gave many instances of man's present afflictions and unhappy condition and of his unsuccessful efforts to find remedies, unsuccessful  because he is ignoring the Source of the healing remedy, the Divine Physician. 

 Among other passages, Mr. Sears quoted what Baha'u'llah  wrote to Queen Victoria, that the solution  to the ills of the world was to be found in "the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith."28 Mr. Sears also cited passages from the Bible and from scholars concerning the day in which we are living and the coming of Baha'u'llah. 

 An enthralled thralled audience heard Mr. Sears's stirring appeal: "So let us no longer remain a society of nuclear giants and ethical midgets.. 

 Let us be at last the children of God, and not of man!" He concluded his address by citing selections from the Writings of Baha'u'llah concerning the 

Divine Physician.         
                          
        FOURTH DAY                

 Prayers in Ateso, Icelandic, Urdu and Thai opened the programme for the next-to-last day of the Congress which had for its theme "The Spiritual Conquest of the Planet". 

 'All Naishjavdni, member of the newly-elected Universal House of Justice, one of the first to respond to the Guardian's call for pioneers to Africa during the Ten Year Crusade, was chairman of the morning session, He reviewed the topics covered in the first three days of the Congress and stated: "We now invite you to move together into the field of action.., the all-important work of teaching the Faith to the multitudes." 

 He referred to the special meeting held the previous evening to discuss experience in mass conversion areas and added: "We realize how the Faith of God is rapidly moving into a new era." He quoted several passages from the Writings of Baha'u'llah pointing to this time, and read some messages from the Guardian written at the beginning of the teaching work in Africa which showed that Shoghi Effendi saw in those modest achievements the beginning  of mass conversion. The Guardian likened the efforts of the pioneers to the deeds of the Apostles of Christ and to those of the Dawn-breakers in our Faith. "What has been achieved in Mrica," the Guardian wrote though his secretary, "sets an example to be followed by Baha'is everywhere. 

 The Guardian sees no reason why such victories should not be achieved in all parts of the world." 

 The addresses of the three speakers revolved around the subject "The Opening of New Territories: Victories of the Pioneers". Ruth Pringle was the first to speak. 

 In introducing her the chairman said that she had become a Baha'i in the first year of the Ten Year Crusade, had been a pioneer in Central America and was now a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of Panama. 

 She gave a thrilling presentation of mass conversion

  among the San Bias Indians of Panama and told of devoted teaching work done by two "graduates" of the school for indigenous Baha'is, one of whom, though blind, went out through dangerous mountain trails to teach the Indians in these areas. 
     The second speaker was     

Mas'6d Khamsi, Auxiliary   

 Board member and a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Bolivia. He had been a pioneer in Central Persia, then in Argentina, and more recently in Bolivia. 

 He told of the rapid progress of the Faith in Bolivia within the past three years, chiefly among the Indians, who have actively participated in the teaching work, walking great distances, sometimes sixty miles a day, to visit scattered villages. Their strenuous efforts were rewarded and there are now more than six thousand Baha in Bolivia. 

 Giving many examples of how the pioneers were guided to find waiting souls, he commented that the potential is there but many more teachers are needed. 

     The Hand of the Cause Enoch

 Olinga, the Knight of Baha'u'llah for the British Cameroons, was the final speaker of the morning. 

 Mr. NakhjavAni, in introducing Mr. Olinga, said that the beloved Guardian called him "the father of victories". 

 Mr. Olinga, in his turn, began his address by referring to Mr. Nakhja-vAnf  as "the father of mass conversion in Africa." He said we should not be surprised at what has been accomplished in Africa because, at the beginning of the Crusade, Shoghi Effendi had called upon the Baha'is of the world to eclipse, in this decade, what had been achieved in the preceding eleven decades3~ The Guardian, Mr. Olinga added, "living in the world of reality, was able to see what the people of God, the followers of Baha'u'llah, were destined to achieve in a single decade." 

 With great humility Mr. Olinga told of a cablegram that had been received from the beloved Guardian one day early in April saying that five believers were to go to five virgin territories in West Africa before April 21st and that these pioneers were to be believers from British Cameroons. 

 The Baha'i Faith had been known there for only about five months. Mr. Olinga said this was a lesson in faith to him. A meeting was called, and five new believers did arise. They went in response to the Guardian's

 wish and all were named by him Knights of Baha'u'llah. 

 Then came one of the most poignant moments of the Congress. The chairman called upon Mrs. Fawziyyih TaliMn, the wife of one of the three Baha'is imprisoned and under sentence of death in Morocco. She was present at the Congress with her young son. She chanted a prayer and then the little boy was lifted up to the microphone and he chanted a short prayer in Arabic. "The beloved Guardian in one of his letters in Persian says that joy and sadness always embrace each other," Mr. Nakhjav~ni said. "Here at this moment of great joy and jubilation, we see reason for broken hearts, and we hope that everything that is happening will result in the ultimate triumph of the Faith of Baha'u'llah." 

 Fred Murray, an eighty-seven-year-old Australian  Aborigine, addressed the Congress. In simple words he spoke from an overflowing heart of the happiness he was experiencing in being with the Baha'is. He described being carried from Australia across the ocean in "a great new flying kangaroo" and being set down in London in a multicoloured garden of humanity. "Yes, dear friends, 1 am glad to see the people here, like flowers of all colours Baha'u'llah has given me a good life.. I have joy in my heart." 

 The afternoon session continued the theme of 

"The Spiritual Conquest    

 of the Planet", with special emphasis on "Enrichment of the World Baha'i Community 

:Enrollment ofthe Masses". There
were four speakers: Shirin 

Boman, Auxiliary Board     

 member and a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of India; Alvin Blum, 

Knight of Baha'u'llah      
for the Solomon Islands;   

Jamshid Fozdar, Auxiliary  

 Board member and a member of the Regional Spiritual 

Assembly of South East     

 Asia; and the Hand of the Cause Dr. Rahmatu'11Th MuhAjir. The chairman, K. K. Bhargawi, member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India, pointed out that it was Baha'u'llah Who had shown the way to teach, with pure hearts and proclaiming the Message in His Name. 

 Mrs. Boman spoke of the progress in teaching the masses in India. 

 It began, she said, in 1961 with the visit of the Hand of the Cause Dr. Mirza to a village in central India. This was followed by visits to villages "where Amatu'I-Bahd Rd~iyyih Klzdnum renewed Izerfriendshjp with "Uncle" Fred Murray, an Australian Aborigine believer.


<p72>
72                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

 teeming, illiterate masses, cut off from a sophisticated atmosphere, unaware of the socalled  culture and ways of the world, live." It was soon realized that in the realm of spirituality  these people far surpassed those who are educated according to modern concepts. As an example Mrs. Boman told of one illiterate believer who explained how she remembered God in her daily life: she likened it to a woman carrying a jug of water on her head while walking and conversing with friends or avoiding  obstacles in her path — she was always remembering the pot full of water on her head. 

 Alvin Blum told of his pioneering experiences in 

New Zealand, the Philippines
and the Solomon Islands.   

 In the Philippines he met a group who had become Baha'is through reading a small pamphlet left in a university library by a Baha'i world traveller who had stopped there for a few hours just before World War I. From that small beginning the Faith grew and today there are thousands of Baha'is in the Philippines. 

 Mr. and Mrs. Blum arrived in the Solomons aboard an old ship and found living in the islands a Baha'i pioneer who was ill from hardship and discouragement. They took her on board their ship in the harbour for meals. The ship's departure was delayed time and again by a broken engine; meanwhile, the pioneer was restored to health and encouraged. A Baha'i school has been established there and now there are many Baha'is. 

 The secret of pioneering, Mr. Blum said, is to sacrifice and be willing to give everything of yourself in the path of service. 

 "Be willing to be sick, to be lonely, to cry, to give up your 'self' and to pray for God's help. 

 The power of prayer, friends, is dynamic!" He described a number of experiences illustrating how Baha'u'llah opens doors to the hearts. 

 Two Indian friends from Bolivia who are active in teaching and pioneering in that country were presented, expressing their happiness at being with the friends at the Congress. "In the name of the Indians of Bolivia I greet and salute you," said Andr~s Jachakollo. 

 "I am not a literate man, and I am very happy to be here to see my brothers from all over the world.. 

 We want unity and love for the whole world... 

 When we go out from here, we have to teach all that we have learned from this International  Congress. 

 We have to help each other through prayers all over the Baha'i world. The Holy Spirit is the power that propels us in our lives... This is the way we can find unity, love and universal peace." 

   Max Kenyerezi, Knight      

 of Baha'u'llah for French Equatorial Mrica, a member of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa where lie is actively associated with mass teaching, called on the friends to use "the spirit radiating from this Conference to galvanize  our teaching effort and bring in masses of believers in all continents." 

    In introducing Jamshid     

 Fozdar, the chairman said that the beloved Guardian had referred to Mr. Fozdar as "the spiritual conqueror  of Sarawak." Mr. Fozdar said, "If we, the pioneers, have learned one thing from this Crusade, we have learned this, that we must never gauge the power of Baha'u'llah by our own ability to perform and deliver." 

 He said he was "haunted" by the limitations that one's degree of faith placed on what could be achieved. He gave illustrations of the great spiritual capacity of the Baha'is of Vietnam and British Borneo under conditions of imprisonment,  surrounded by chaos and revolution. 

 There is no "separate standard" for persons of different nationalities, he said, and mass conversion is possible even in highly developed countries if we apply the universal standard of belief in Baha'u'llah as the Messenger  of God for this time. He reminded us that the religion of God is like air and water, freely given by God, the Giver of life and that in crusades to follow "like tidal waves" other Baha'is "will take the torch of the Faith of Baha'u'llah to the dark continents of the hearts of men." 

 Several indigenous believers, from Malaysia, Mentawei Islands, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cameroon, spoke with profound emotion of their joyful experiences in teaching the Faith. Vicente Samaniego, speaking of his return to his native Philippine Islands, said: "When I return to the villages I can tell them that I saw the garden of God! I can tell them that we now have the International House of Justice! Let me close by saying a prayer for the Universal House of Justice. 

 The Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'lhh Muhftjir expressed delight to have seen "on this blissful day, the fruits of those who laboured in the teaching field during the Ten Year Crusade." He said that mass conversion was now in

  augurated in thirty countries of the world but that this is just a beginning. 

 We must arise in full confidence that Baha'u'llah and the beloved Master will help us as They promised and as They helped those who arose before us. The nations and islands "yearn for pioneers" and wherever they have gone the pioneers have been greeted by the native people with the question "Why didn't you come earlier to give us this Message?" 

 In 1921, he reminded us, Agnes Alexander, Hand of the Cause of God, who was then a young woman, pioneered to Korea and travelled in the Orient where today there are three thousand believers. 
We must make a beginning. 

 If the result of the labours of approximately one hundred friends has been a quarter of a million believers, what will be the result if a vast army of us will arise to pioneer! 
                          
        FIFTH DAY                 

  The morning session of the last day of the Congress, Thursday, May 2, directed our attention to the future, the theme being "Our 

Sacred Duty, Our Glorious 
Challenge".               

 Prayers were offered in various languages and then the chairman, Gila Data, member of the 

Regional Spiritual Assembly

 of North East Africa, read the opening passage of Shoghi 

Effendi's The Promised    
Day Is Come.              

 Annaliese Bopp, secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Germany, said that in Europe "our sacred duty, our glorious challenge" was "to reach our goal of mass conversion even if we are the last ones to pass the line." The "edifice, the foundations of which Baha'u'llah has laid in our hearts"3o has now been erected, but it remains for the Ba1A'is to make it the refuge for mankind. Much remains to be done before our Assemblies learn to function as Houses of Justice, before the victory is won over our own selves and we become conscious "at every moment of our lives, that we alone are the instruments through which 

Baha'u'llah, the Manifestation
of God, will save mankind."

 Ijushmand Fatheazarn, member of the newly-elected Universal House of Justice,


<p74>
74                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 related many inspiring instances of the rapid spread of the Faith among the masses in India. He likened the simple, unlettered, humble believers in the mass conversion areas to the rough, unpolished stone that the Master placed as the cornerstone of the great Mother Temple of the West; through their acceptance of the Faith will be raised the temple of the unity of mankind and on this foundation world civilization  will be built. He encouraged us to continually  engage in service to the Cause regardless  of the apparent results for no service is wasted and if we are faithful to this responsibility we can enter the presence of Baha'u'llah, when our earthly lives end, with contented hearts. 

 Dr. Peter Khan, an Auxiliary Board member from the United States said that as mass conversion  is extended it will "disturb the equilibrium  of the world." From a letter of Shoghi Effendi's he read words that are "as vividly relevant as when they were written": "There is no time to lose. The hour is ripe for the proclamation,  without fear, without reserve, and without hesitation, and on a scale never as yet undertaken, of the One Message that can alone extricate humanity from the morass into which it is steadily sinking. 

 Dr. Khan concluded his remarks by saying that as our community grows more diverse we should strive to follow the example of the Guardian and "adjust our goals to the conditions,  the background, the nature of the people in each national community.. 

 It is like raising children of different ages, talents and training... The Faith must be kept simple, and its procedures  flexible." 

 We must remember that our Faith is not a scientific or economic system, but a world religion and in our teaching we must continually "bear in mind that the centre of our Faith is the acceptance and recognition of Baha'u'llah as a Manifestation of God." 

 The Hand of the Cause of God John Robarts reminded us that while we rejoice over our victories, we must "remember that the beloved Guardian's Ten 

Year Spiritual Crusade     

 is the beginning of the beginning." He cited passages from the writings of Shoghi Effendi in which the Guardian appealed to the friends to arise, to teach, to serve this great Cause, for the time is short and the hour critical. "We really should reread and study the letters and messages of Shoghi Effendi." Teaching is like building a bridge over an abyss of despair, said Mr. Robarts, with God on one side of the abyss and man on the other. "Every one of us has some part to play in the construction of this bridge. 

     Leong Tat Chee of Malaya   

 greeted the Congress and sketched the progress of the Faith in that country, commenting that most of the believers in Malaya are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, that their "enthu-siasm and steadfastness pushed older people like myself to go forward and do more for the Cause" and that they long for the day when they can participate in spreading the Faith throughout  China. 

 The final session of the Congress inevitably arrived and, with profound appreciation and overflowing hearts, was devoted to the loving memory of Shoghi Effendi, the Sign of God on earth. 
For this programme the     

Knights of Baha'u'llah      

 and many Baha'is in colourful native costumes were seated in tiers rising behind the speakers. 

 William Masehia, member of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of South and West Africa, was the chairman. After referring briefly to the deteriorating condition of the world in contrast to the victories won by the Baha'is under the leadership of the Guardian, he introduced the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Ra~iyyih Kh~num to whom all hearts turned in deepest love and longing to hear her speak of Shoghi Effendi.* 

 A brief r6sumd of her remarks follows. 

     Abdu'l-Baha Rabfyyih      

 Kh6num spoke of the station of Baha'u'llah, giving the example of the sun which shines on every part of the world. Nobody owns it, controls it or has a monopoly of it. The same is true of Baha'u'llah. He belongs to those who have accepted Him. This is not a derived right. 

 The Baha'is have not had this belief in Him passed on to them by pioneers or institutions but have it because they accept Him, like the plants which accept to grow in the sunlight everywhere. 

 This great and varied gathering of Baha is evidence of this fact. 

 Literacy, education, riches are not necessary for this acceptance. 

 The materialistic civilization of the Western countries, afflicted with the diseases of regimentation and uniformity  and prejudice, is an evil, and not something to be imitated by other nations. More* * Excerpts from this and other addresses given at the World Congress appear in Baha News, 

August 1963.

  The national dresses of Baha'is from many lands added colour and variety to the World Congress. 

 Fourth from the right in the photograph is the Hand of the Cause IjasanBalyuzi, who addressed the Congress on the first day. 

  over, it is not in accord with the Teachings of Baha'u'llah nor with many points of guidance given to us by Shoghi Fifendi. Unity in diversity  is the watchword of the Faith. We are not supposed to be alike. 

 We are supposed to be different within a certain great framework. The Guardian encouraged National Spiritual Assemblies  to have diversity in secondary administrative matters, each adapting the principle in the Teachings to its own way. Shoghi Effendi assigned to different parts of the Baha'i world responsibilities and tasks commensurate with their maturity and strength. He did not expect the Baha'is of primitive tribes to do what he expected the communities of Tihiin or London, Paris or New York to accomplish. 

 For example, Baha is in some parts of the world need only board a bus near their own front door in order to attend the Nineteen Day Feast; while in other parts of the world the friends must travel at night through snake-infested grass in the jungle. The point is that the Baha'i world is a living, evolving thing. It moves at different paces and adapts itself to local needs, to some extent. 

 We all cannot live in the same way and we had better look after the beam in our own eye before busying ourselves with the mote in the eye of another. 

 The process of education of the Baha'is of the West in obeying the laws of Baha'u'llah began with 'Abdu'l-Baha and was continued by Shoghi Effendi, who extended it to the African believers so that now they are able to also apply many of the laws of Baha'u'llah that have been in force in Persia and America for many years. In this picture of the different stages of development  of the Cause we see the evidence of how perfect it is. These are the signs of its life and vitality; the signs of the wisdom and guidance of Shoghi Effendi. He brought us all to where we are today and gave each one of us the measure we could take. He told us how to forge ahead and build the Cause in the days to come. That is the supreme task facing us, to carry out his instructions when we leave this hail. 

 The desire to dominate is an animal instinct that is probably bound up with the desire to survive. 

 We must ensure that the Cause is protected,  that the functions of Spiritual Assemblies  as defined by the Guardian are carried


<p76>
76                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 out. Our administrative bodies must not be used as a means of stifling the believers or dominating them unduly. Implicit obedience to the administrative institutions is the law of God. This brings great spiritual strength and cohesion which renders the Baha'i Faith unassailable,  locally, nationally and internationally. 

 Nevertheless, this system enshrines the freedom of the individual and the protection of his or her rights. It might be said that ours is the religion of the golden mean — you do not have dominance by an institution or defiance and rebellion on the part of individuals. 

 When the time came for the Guardian to launch the Ten Year World Crusade he called for pioneers, for sacrifice, and the 

Baha'is responded. We     

 would not have won this Crusade, nor would we be sitting in this hail today so radiantly happy, with such a wide representation from the Baha of the world, if the Guardian had not encouraged everybody to go forth and serve. He had only thirty-six years to give us the necessary instructions and interpretations, and that was a very brief time in which to make as clear as Shoghi Effendi made it the picture of the Administrative Order and the World Order of Baha'u'llah and what they represent. 

 He has given us all that we really need to go on with. 

 The Guardian was always delighted when news came of large increases in the number of Baha'is in any country. He clearly recognized that the friends needed deepening, that the victories needed consolidating. 

 But if we teach fearlessly and welcome these people into the Cause of God, God will raise up from amongst them teachers and ways and means of deepening  them. Again and again the Guardian told the Baha'is that we do not study the Teachings enough. 

    Abdu'l-Baha R6~iyyih     

 Kb4num then said she would talk a little about the Guardian, about his person and his personality. 

 She described his appearance, his beautiful eyes, his sensitive hands and his true humility. "He hadn't one speck of personal pride or conceit in his entire makeup; but when it came to the Cause of God, he was a lion."She spoke of how simply he lived. On her trips with him to Switzerland, where he loved to climb and walk among the mountains, she told of their staying in the cottages of peasants, living on a very strict budget which he had established. 

 He had a great love for the mountains and during the last summer of his life he returned to all tht places he most loved. 

 At this point Abdu'l-Baha RiM~iyyih KMnum was unable to continue for a few moments, as these memories overwhelmed her. Spontaneously the African singers arose and softly and lovingly sang A11Ah-u-AbhA until she was able to go on. She then began to speak of the characteristics of the Guardian, one of the strongest of which she described as his "absolutely iron principle". "Nothing could interfere with what he considered right. 

 Nothing  swayed him at all, neither love, nor hate, nor danger." She related examples. One concerned  the naming of a small street opposite the Master's house by the 

Haifa Municipality. It    
had put up a sign "Baha   

Street". The Guardian     

 considered it an insult to the Faith to put the name of its Prophet on a street and lit sent his brother to the authorities to tell them to take down the sign immediately; if they did. not, he would tear it down with his own hands, and if th&y wanted to put him in jail, let them. 

 Another example of what was described as• Shoghi Effendi's "diamond-like integrity" was that when the Hand of the Cause Valiyu'llAh Varq~ applied to make his pilgrimage to Haifa, he had to take his turn. Although he was a Hand of the Cause and Trustee of Ijuqaqu'llAh he was not given preferential treatment but received permission in his turn. 

 "It made no difference to Shoghi Effendi who anyone was, if there was a matter of principle involved." Whether it was a matter of returning a donation of some $150,000 made in the absence of the Guardian from Haifa by a man with whom Shoghi Effendi was "displeased", or having to declare his own brother a violator because of misconduct, where a matter of principle in the Faith was involved, Shoghi Effendi wa~ "absolutely impervious". It is these things we must learn from him. This kind of integrity will keep this Cause spotless for a thousand years. The example of the integrity of Shoghi Effendi must be followed by the Baha'is and the Assemblies, because it is the standard of 

God.                      

 Some examples were cited of other characteristics of the Guardian we should seek to emulate, his courtesy, his patience, his sense of order. He did not once rebuke her in all their twenty years together for her own untidiness. lie knew when to say no, and said it, whether

  to an individual or a 

National Spiritual Assembly. 
"He was swayed by nobody.  

 The only consideration he had was for the Faith." 

 He suffered deeply because of the actions of members of his family. He showed them great patience, warned them repeatedly, and these sorrows wore him down. She spoke of his instant decisions that were like flashes of inspiration, and of other times when he would "burn and suffer by the hour" over some problem or plan before coming to any decision at all. 

 "So much of his life was suffering.. he had such a capacity for suffering.. 

 he was deeply sensitive and loving and he was ground down all his life though the actions and words of others. .2 From the day he was appointed Guardian, for the rest of his life, he could not have a moment's respite from the responsibilities and burdens of the Faith. 

 He was its Guardian. He wrote out in his own hand the cablegrams that were sent from Haifa, including  the one concerning the passing of Martha Root.32 His beautiful tribute to Miss Root he wrote sitting up in bed when he was ill with a high fever. Brushing aside R6ljiyyih KhAnum's protestations he said, "Don't you understand, the greatest teacher in the Baha'i world has died and the whole Baha'i world is waiting to hear what I am going to say about her. This cannot wait." 

   Abdu'l-Baha Rfl~iyyih      

 Khftnurn concluded her address with these words: "Friends, do not fail Shoghi Effendi. You have not finished with him and he has not finished with you. lit is the time to put your step on new trails, to make new vows to go out and please Shoghi Effendi and make him happier than he ever was in this world... Let us all carry on the work of our beloved Lord, Baha'u'llah, every day of our lives, because we are His people and we are blessed far beyond our deserts." 

 The closing address of the Congress was given by the Hand of the Cause 

Abfi'1-QAsim Faizi. As     

 though from an inexhaustible storehouse  he brought forth story after story to illustrate deep spiritual truths. In one story Mr. Faizi told what Baha'u'llah had said to some Persian and Arab princes who were standing among the many people gathered outside His House in BaghdAd. 

 Baha'u'llah asked them, "What is the news of the town? 

 What is the A group of Africaui Baha'is presenting a selection of songs with Baha'i themes composed by the Baha'is of Africa.

  news of the market?" One of the Persian princes said, "How is it that when You are with Your own people You speak to them of exalted subjects, but to us You only ask about the news of the market?" 

 As Baha'u'llah paced back and forth, He said, in effect, that "the people who can hear My words are not yet created," and He added: "If there are pearls beneath seven seas, I will bring them up. 

 If there are jewels hidden beyond seven mountains, by the power of the attraction of the Word of God, I will bring them out." These pearls and jewels, Mr. Faizi pointed out, we see gathered here at this World Congress from all parts of the world. 

    Another story Mr. Faizi    

 related was about a little boy and his father who were standing on the edge of a crowd watching a juggler. Neither the father nor his son could see through the crowd so the father lifted the boy up on his shoulders and soon the child was laughing and clapping and asked his father why he did not join in the merriment. 

 The kind father did not answer the boy's question but a man standing nearby said to the child, "My dear boy, you can see all these things because you are up on the shoulders of your father. 

 Do not be ungrateful to your father!" Mr. Faizi added, "So let us not forget the early believers, because we are standing  on their shoulders when we see all these glorious victories of Baha'u'llah's Faith today." 

 The greatest requirement for pioneers is patience, Mr. Faizi said, referring to pioneers who teach for years without apparent results, as, for example, JamAl Effendi, sent by Baha'u'llah  to India, and Mirza Jjaydar-'A1I, the first teacher sent by Him to Africa. "Patience," he continued, "is a quality which is described in the Qur'an as having rewards unlimited. Please have patience. God will work through you and, even if it is not in your lifetime, in the lifetime of generations after you, all services will be rewarded." 

 Tn concluding his address, Mr. Faizi said that although the Ten Year Crusade of the beloved Guardian has come to a victorious conclusion, we are always in his service, we live forever under his shadow, and we will carry in our hearts forever the memory of his beautiful face. 

 After the reading of selections from the


<p79>
THE MOST GREAT JUBILEE           79

 Writings of Baha'u'llah, the Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha, and prayers in English and Persian, the first 

Baha'i World Congress      

 came to an end, but the spirit it engendered would carry on, immeasurable by time or place. There would be other Congresses, perhaps, concluding other Crusades in the future, patterned after this one, but none would ever be the same. 
This Crusade was the beloved

Guardian's Crusade. It     

 had achieved its great objective, the "conquest of the citadels of men's hearts", and this paved the way for the election of the crowning unit of the Administrative Order. The victories just celebrated would be eclipsed by victories of the future. All the promises of Baha'u'llah and of the Guardian would be fulfilled. The instruments of that fulfillment, the Baha'is of the world, now looked forward eagerly to wider fields of action, on an unassailable foundation, under the guidance of the Universal 

House of Justice.          

 To conclude this report no more fitting comments can be made than those by the Universal House of Justice in its first message to the National Conventions throughout the world, sent out a few days after the Congress ~ "The Universal House of Justice wishes to reaffirm at this time the tribute which it felt moved to pay to the Hands of the Cause of God at the World Congress, those precious souls who have brought the Cause safely to victory in the name of Shoghi Effendi. We wish also to remember the devoted work of their Auxiliary Board members, as well as the services of the Knights of Baha'u'llah, of the army of pioneers, the members of the National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies, the services and prayers and sacrifices of the believers everywhere, all of which in the sum total have attracted such bounties and favors from Baha'u'llah... 

 "Beloved friends, we enter the second epoch of the Divine Plan blessed beyond compare, riding the crest of a great wave of victory produced  for us by our beloved Guardian. The Cause of God is now firmly rooted in the world. Forward then, confident in the power and protection of the Lord of Hosts, Who will, through storm and trial, toil and jubilee, use His devoted followers to bring to a despairing humanity the life-giving waters of His supreme Revelation."

INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF CURRENT

                  BAHA'I ACTIVITIES

  "Call out to Zion, 0 Cannel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was hidden from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty eignty is mant/est; His all-encompassing splendour is revealed. 

 Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will mantfest the people of Ba/id who have been mentioned in the Book of Names." 

                              Baha'u'llah: Tablet of Carmel

  RIDVAN 120(1963), a date well remembered. No doubt future generations will look back on those twelve days as some of the most momentous  in human history. 

 At that time, however, only a handful of people had any concept of their importance in shaping the destiny of mankind.  It was the one hundredth anniversary of the Most Great Festival,1 and the Baha'is were beginning to assemble in London to observe the Most Great Jubilee,2 while to the east in the Holy Land their elected representatives were meeting in convention3 to elect, for the first time, the members of the Universal 

House of Justice.          

 Those fate-laden days introduced a period of untold significance both to the future unfoldment of the Cause of God and to human destiny, a period which embraced the opening of the second epoch in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan and the beginning of the tenth and last part of that divinely propelled process which began six thousand years ago at the dawn of the Adamic cycle and which, as stated by Shoghi Effendi, is destined to culminate in "the stage at which the light of God's triumphant Faith shining in all its power and glory will have suffused and enveloped the entire planet." 

 Having triumphantly concluded the beloved Guardian's Ten Year Global Crusade, the believers were afforded a one year respite before the launching, at Ri~1vAn 1964, of a new worldwide teaching plan covering a nine year period, culminating in 1973, the centenary year of the

revelation of the Most     

Holy Book (Kitab-i-Aqdas). 

 Although no specific goals were assigned, during the intervening year the rapid expansion of the Faith continued. Thirteen new 

National Spiritual Assemblies
were formed at Ricjvdn 1964;

1,015 Local Spiritual      

 Assemblies were added; and there were 4,114 more centres established throughout the world making a total of 15,186 localities where 

Baha resided. During     

 that year Baha'i literature was translated  and printed in 37 additional languages, and believers from 83 new tribes enrolled under the banner of Baha'u'llah; and there were many other accomplishments such as the establishment  of 55 new Baha'i Schools and 

Institutes.                

 In preparing the Baha'is of the world for the launching of the Nine Year Plan1 the Universal House of Justice reminded the friends that "We stand now upon the threshold of the second epoch of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan.. ." and that the Cause of God".. now enters a new epoch, the third of the Formative Age." 

 The message launching the Plan at RhJvAn 1964 stated that Shoghi Effendi "clearly foresaw in the 'tremendously long' tenth part of the process  already referred to, a series of plans to be launched by the Universal House of Justice, extending over 'successive epochs of both the Formative and Golden Ages of the "2 In broad outline the Nine Year Plan3 called for the settling of nearly all territories remaining unopened to the Faith; the adding of forty-six new National Spiritual Assemblies; nearly Message to the Baha'is of the world, October 1963.

 It had to provide its own offices; settle its members and their families in the Holy Land; assemble a staff to assist with its work; provide for the continuation of the Pilgrimage; define its relationship with the Hands of the Cause, both those residing in the Holy Land and those responsible for continental areas; provide for the continuing custodianship and maintenance of the Hoiy Places and their surrounding  gardens; set up procedures for the conduct of its business and for the handling of its communications; take charge of and provide for the replenishment of the Baha'i International Fund; consult upon such important matters as the razing of the Temple in 'Jsjhq& 1 A more detailed presentation of the launching of the Nine Year Plan appears on page 101 of this volume.

     THE GUARDIANSHIP           

  But the major question to be resolved, and the one which oniy the Universal House of Justice, by virtue of the authority conferred upon it by the Pen of Baha'u'llah, could speak upon at this time, was that of a successor to Shoghi Effendi as Guardian of the Cause of God. On 

October 6, 1963 the House  
of Justice informed all    

National Spiritual Assemblies

 that after prayerful and careful study of the Holy Texts and after prolonged consultation the Universal House of Justice "finds that there is no way to appoint or to legislate to make it possible to appoint a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi."3 Subsequently the brief text of the resolution of the House of Justice was elucidated in letters written to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Netherlands4  and to an individual be1iever,~ citing references which had been studied by the Universal House of Justice prior to the release of its letter of October 6, 1963 and further explaining the relationship between the Guardianship  and the Universal House of

  Mirza Mubammad-'Ali, half-brother of 'Abdu'l-Baha, designated by Shoghi Effendi as the "archbreaker of Baha'u'llah's Covenant," had challenged the appointment of 'Abdu'l-Baha as the Centre of that Covenant. Following the ascension of Baha'u'llah, Muliammad-'Ali, his children, relatives and a few other 

Covenant-breakers          

 breakers continued to live in the immediate vicinity of the Sacred Tomb, having inherited some shares in the Mansion and adjacent buildings. 

 Mu]~ammad-'A1i died in 1937, five years after the Guardian had succeeded in removing him from the Mansion itself and restoring it to its former beauty. Over a long period of years Shoghi Effendi was able to carry out the legal steps that eliminated most of the unsightly structures which stood near the Mansion and the Shrine, and which continued to be occupied by the Covenant-breakers. 

 On September 6, 1957, shortly before his passing, Shoghi Effendi announced the "com-plete  evacuation of the remnant of Covenant-breakers and the transfer of all their belongings from the precincts of the Most Holy Shrine and the purification, after six long decades, of the Ijararn-i-Aqdas from every trace of their contamination."  The removal of the remains of Mirza Diy&u'llTh from the inner sanctuary of the Shrine of Baha'u'llah was final evidence of the decline of the fortunes of those who for so many years had attempted to subvert the Cause of God.


<p84>
84                 THE BAHA'I WORLD
    WORLD CENTRE GOALS         

  At the end of the fourth year of the Nine Year Plan, the Universal House of Justice reported progress on the World Centre goals. 
                           
    PUBLICATION OF A SYNOPSIS  
AND CODIFICATION OF THE    
      KITAB-I-AQDAS QDAS            

  Preliminary studies for the realization of this important objective have been completed and the Universal House of Justice, on the basis of a draft prepared by Shoghi Effendi in his own handwriting, is actively engaged in codification of the laws of the Most Jloiy 

Book.                      

 In addition to the above mentioned draft by the beloved Guardian which includes the Annex to the Kitab-i-Aqdas, known as the "Questions and Answers", there are a number of supplementary  documents which must be studied in connection with the codification of the laws such as: Tablets of Baha'u'llah in "elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws "Subsidiary ordinances designed to supplement the provisions of His Most Holy Book," revealed by Baha'u'llah in some of His Tablets. 

  The letters and writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi in interpretation of the laws and ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. 

  It may also be recalled that at the instruction of the beloved Guardian, and with his approval, the laws of personal status were codified in Egypt to serve as a legal document to be submitted  to the 

Egyptian Government. Furthermore 

 there are a number of compilations in Persian by BaWd scholars in which attempts were made to classify the laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas and collate the Writings connected with those Laws. 
                           
FORMULATION OF THE         
 CONSTITUTION OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE
OF JUSTICE                 

  The Universal House of Justice has been working toward the accomplishment of this goal since the inception of the Nine Year Plan, but since its achievement is dependent upon careful study of the Texts and the instructions of the beloved Guardian as well as upon the resolution of many important questions, it has not yet been possible to formulate the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice. A document of such fundamental importance to the Faith will require, it is anticipated, many more months of intensive study and deliberation  for its realization.

VIEW TO THE EXTENSION INTO 
THE                        
  FUTURE OF ITS APPOINTED    
  FUNCTIONS OF PROTECTION    
      AND PROPAGATION            

 The passing of the Guardian and the impossibility of appointing a successor to Shoghi Effendi left the Universal House of Justice as the sole infallibly guided institution in the Faith and, ipso facto, its head. This brought about an entirely new relationship between the Universal House of Justice and the Hands of the Cause of God, a relationship which has to be progressively defined by the House of Justice itself. 

 The responsibility for and authority to expel Covenant-breakers had been conferred upon the Hands of the Cause in the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, as part of their function of protection. 

 This responsibility became operative following the passing of Shoghi Effendi when the Hands, as Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth,  had to undertake the direction of the Cause pending the election of the Universal House of Justice. In October 

1963 the Universal House   

 of Justice confirmed that the Hands would continue to exercise this authority, fully investigating all cases involving Covenant-breaking and expelling violators from the Faith, subject to the ultimate approval of the House of Justice itself. 

 In May 1963 the Hands of the Cause had decided that their Auxiliary Board members should be freed from administrative responsibilities and had requested them to decide by 1 For a further report on the Hands of the Cause see page 459 of this volume.


<p85>
CURRENT BAHA I ACTIVITIES        85

 RIQvAn 1964 in which function they wished to serve. 

 In view of this decision and request, the Universal House of Justice ruled in November 1963 that Auxiliary Board members would continue to be eligible for election to National Spiritual Assemblies, but that whenever one was elected he would have to choose between service on the Auxiliary Board or the 

Assembly.                  

 This, therefore, was the situation when the Nine Year Plan was launched in April 1964, with the Hands of the Cause of God as its Standard Bearers. 

 At the end of October and in early November 1964 the Universal House of Justice consulted the Body of the Hands of the Cause of God and, after considering their viewsand recommendations,  and studying the Sacred Texts, concluded that there is no way to appoint, or to legislate to make it possible to appoint Hands of the Cause of God. 

 This decision was the first major step indicating the direction which the fulfilment of the goal of the Plan must take. 

 Clearly, the functions of protection and propagation would have to be continued in the future and the development  of the institution of the Hands would have to follow a course which would enable it to carry out its functions at the present time while facilitating the future transition. 

 Three steps were then taken to develop the work of the Institution of the Hands: 1. The continents of Asia and the Western Hemisphere were each divided into zones for the day-to-day work of the Hands, one or more Hands being responsible for each zone; the Hawaiian Islands were transferred from the continental area of the Western Hemisphere to that of Australasia. 

  2. The number of Auxiliary Board members for the propagation of the Faith was increased in each continent, raising the total number of Auxiliary Board members in Africa from eighteen to twenty-seven; in Asia from fourteen to thirty-six; in Australasia from four to nine; in Europe from eighteen to twenty-seven;  and in the Western Hemisphere from eighteen to thirty-six. 

 3. In accordance with a precedent established by the beloved Guardian, the Hands of the Cause in each continent were called upon to appoint one or more of their Auxiliary Board members to act in an executive capacity on behalf of and in the name of each Hand, thereby assisting him in carrying out his work. 

  As this goal is specified to be achieved in consultation with the Hands of the 

Cause, the Universal House 

 of Justice and the Hands of the Cause are carefully reviewing all available Texts on this subject in preparation for full consultation during the gathering of the Hands which is to be held in the Iloiy Land following the International 

Convention in RhJvAn

  Ever since the Universal House of Justice has come into existence, it has been deeply conscious of the need to refer continuously to the Sacred Scriptures, as well as to the writings of Shoghi Effendi, to draw guidance and enlightenment  on the manifold problems with which it is faced. 

 Thanks to the efforts of Shoghi Effendi and the response of the friends in Persia to his call, great strides have already been taken in the collation of the Writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. A special National Committee in Persia is assiduously and regularly engaged in classifying the Holy Texts in fuiffiment of this goal. 

 The collation and indexing of the writings of Shoghi Effendi, in both English and Persian, have been the object of the closest attention of the House of Justice. Though one of its Departments continuous and uninterrupted efforts are made to make extracts and to index important passages from his communications available at the World Centre. 

 Shoghi Effendi's published writings, quotations from his letters that have appeared in "Baha'i News", and various compilations made by Assemblies and individual Baha'is have proved of immense assistance to this work. In this connection we wish to express appreciation to the Hands of the Cause residing in the lloiy Land for their invaluable help in this field.

 In December 1967, the House of Justice appealed, through all National Spiritual Assemblies, to all recipients of letters from Shoghi Effendi for copies of these texts.

     TOWARDS THE EMANCIPATION  
OF                        
THE FAITH FROM THE FETThRS
OF

ITS                       
             RECOGNITION AS AN INDEPENDENT RELIGION

 To carry forward this essential objective, a number of measures have been taken in countries that have for many years been traditionally opposed to the Faith: 

Persia                    
      That National Spiritual   

 Assembly, following instructions of the House of Justice, has taken a number of official actions to bring to the attention  of the ShTh, the Prime Minister, certain cabinet ministers, government officials of lower rank in the capital as well as those in the provinces, the disabilities and difficulties which have affected the lives of many of the believers in that country. On a number of occasions, discussions of these problems resulted in their removal in a limited degree. 

        At the United Nations     

 a number of officials in the Human Rights Department have been briefed on conditions in Persia affecting that Baha'i community. 

 An official memorandum listing some of these disabilities has been submitted by our United Nations representative to the IrAnian delegate to the Human Rights Conference. 
                          
Morocco'                  

 The grave problem caused by the imprisonment  of a number of Baha in that country was being dealt with prior to the establishment of the Universal House of Justice in April 1963. Full responsibility for its further solution was assumed by the House of Justice, and ultimate success was achieved resulting in the complete exoneration and release of all the imprisoned 1 For a more complete report see page 97 of this volume. 

 Baha'is. (However, it was learned in early 1968 that another Moroccan believer had been detained and sentenced to three years' imprisonment.) 
                          
Turkey                    

 For a number of years, the Cause in that land was in the stage of obscurity. 

 It was misunderstood as a sect of IslAm and consequently banned as a matter of government policy affecting  religious sects. Vigorous steps were taken to have the Faith recognized as an independent religion, as the result of which a number of Baha'is have been successful in obtaining a Court ruling permitting them to change the designation of their birth certificates from "Muslim" to "Baha'i" thereby, in effect, giving official recognition to the Faith as an independent  religion.

 were forbidden, under a ban which involved a number of international organizations, to conduct any administrative activities. Measures to clarify the position of the Faith and to remove all misunderstandings as to its true character were taken, both within and outside  the country. 
                          
Malaysia                  

 In Selangor Province, a bill was in process of introduction which, if adopted, would have resulted in banning the Cause in that Province, and might have had serious consequences in the rest of the country. Prompt intervention by the Baha'is in explaining the true character of the Faith brought about the abandonment of the government bill in Selangor. Further measures are being taken to strengthen the foundations of the Faith in order to avoid the possibility of similar activities on the part of the government in future. 
                          
   FURTHER RECOGNITION       
       OF THE FAITH              

 The surmounting of tests and difficulties is often followed by significant victories. During the quinquennium covered by this volume, one of the outstanding recognitions accorded the Faith was the incorporation in 1966 of the National Spiritual Assembly of Italy, a goal


<p87>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES         87

  long sought by the friends in Italy and the attainment of which freed their activities from the fetters of a religious orthodoxy centred for centuries in their country. Great strides in the teaching and proclamation programmes were made, and it was possible to select Palermo as the site of the first of the Oceanic Conferences called for in the Nine Year 

Plan.                      

 Another significant achievement in this period was the incorporation of the 

National Spiritual Assembly
of the principality of Monaco.

 Incorporation of the Local Spiritual Assembly  of Reykjavik, Iceland was an important step toward establishing a firm foundation for the election of a National Spiritual Assembly in that country during the course of the Nine Year 

Plan.                      
    The incorporation of the   

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Finland on September 18, 1963 brought about a unique recognition entitling the Baha'i Faith to its own religious register. This was a notable accomplishment in a country which has a state church, but also has a religious freedom law. Through this recognition  the secretaries of Local and National Spiritual Assemblies were granted the authority to prepare and execute official documents required by BaWt'is in many instances when dealing with local or federal authorities. 

    The United States Army     

 also granted a special kind of recognition to the Baha'i Faith. The 

Chief of Army Chaplains    

 wrote:". the Baha World Faith is recognized as an independent  religion by the United States Government,  and therefore by the United States Army." 

 Baha'i servicemen were thereafter entitled  to be identified as Baha in the section of their service record describing religious preference and on their "dogtags". 

 In Canada the action of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration in defining the status of Baha pioneers as "representatives" of the Baha'i "organization" in foreign lands exempted them from automatic loss of citizenship  after prolonged absence from their home country. 

 Other incorporations and recognitions of Baha Holy Days and the Baha'i marriage certificate, too numerous to mention in this survey, were achieved during the period covered by this report and many of them are referred to elsewhere in this volume.

 The extension of existing gardens on Mount Carmel As those who have visited the Holy Shrines in Baha and on Mount Carmel well know, the Baha'i properties in those areas are very extensive,  approaching 550,000 square metres. 

 Much less than half this total area has been developed into gardens and therefore it must be realized that any plan for the extension of the gardens and the beautification of the surroundings of the Holy Shrines might well take many years to implement. 
                           
Development at Babji       
    From the time of the first 

International Baha'i Council

 in 1951 attempts had been made to close the unpaved road which ran close by the Mansion of Baha'u'llah and bisected the Eah&iproperty. This was accomplished in 1968 and the road rerouted so as to permit the extension of the formal gardens to the east of the Mansion of Baha'u'llah. A quadrant in similar design to the quadrant of the Ijaram-i-Aqdas was laid out. Sufficient ground lies to the south and west for the development in future of the other two quadrants completing the circumference  of the gardens around the Holy Shrine. Plans were made for a new entrance making for a more direct approach to the gardens from the main road. Closing the unpaved road also made it possible to erect a fence completely around the Baha'i property, thus giving a measure of protection to the gardens. 
                           
Mt. Carmel                 

 A distinguished Baha architect was called to the Holy Land on two occasions by the Universal House of Justice to prepare a concept  for the extension of the gardens above the Shrine of the Rib and the Archives Building, and in this connection a photogrammetrie survey was obtained. Based upon this survey the architect prepared tentative plans for the development of the entire property and representations  were made with both the Haifa Municipality and the Government of the State of Israel towards the adoption of definite plans H

  for the development of the area in consonance with the wishes expressed by the beloved Guardian. 

 Beyond this, extended improvements  were made, such as, the fencing of property  on Mt. Carmel, including the Temple site; the development of gardens and parking lots adjacent to the Pilgrim House; the paving of the Arc and the main entrance; the building of a wall and the extension of the sidewalk along UNO Avenue adjacent to the IBahA'i gardens, and adding new soil to higher levels of the gardens where erosion had taken place. The Guardian's plan for the floodlighting of the Archives Building was implemented, the floodlighting  of the Shrine of the Bib and the Monument  Gardens was extended, and all the electrical circuits in the gardens were rewired. 

  Holy Places and other buildings One of the first decisions which had to be taken by the Universal House of Justice related to providing its own offices. 

 This was accomplished by converting to office space the former Western Pilgrim House and arranging accommodations  at the 

Eastern Pilgrim House     

 for both eastern and western pilgrims. 

 Practically all the Holy Places and other buildings underwent extensive repairs and maintenance. Included were the following projects: retiling the roof of the Mansion of Baha'u'llah and rebuilding the portico of the Shrine; re-roofing the Pilgrim Houses in bath Baha'i and Haifa; repainting the Mansion at Babji and the House of 'AblThd in 'Akka; painting and gilding the ornamentation on the Shrines of Baha'u'llah and the Bab and the various gates and ornaments in the gardens at Babji and on Mt. Carmel. The flat roof of the Shrine of the flAb was also repaired, and extensive  repairs had to be made to the eastern wing of the terrace in front of the Shrine of the Dab due to the collapse of a retaining wall.

  application for recognition by the United Nations of the Baha'i International Community  as a nongovernmental organization with consultative status. To this end the 

Universal House of Justice 

 decided to assume the function of representing the Baha'i International Community  in its relations with the United Nations, a responsibility which had been shouldered for many years, with great distinction, by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States. 

 The Universal House of Justice decided in 1967 that the volume and scope of the work of the Baha'i 

International Community    

 justified the appointment of a full-time observer. 

 Mrs. Mildred Mottahedeh, who had performed devoted and distinguished part-time service in that office for nearly twenty years, asked to be relieved of the heavy responsibility, and Dr. Victor de Araujo was appointed Accredited Representative. 

 Mrs. Mottahedeli accepted appointment as Alternate Representative of the Baha International 

Community.                 

 A number of valuable and constructive acti vities were carried out during the 1963 — 6S period. 

 In continuing its observer status as a NonGovernmental 

Organization, the Baha International

 Community sent representatives to meetings open to it as well as maintaining current contact with the activities of the United Nations in New York and elsewhere. 

 Baha delegations attended the annual conferences of Non-Goverrnnental Organizations associated with the United Nations and a delegation also attended the observances of the Twentieth Anniversary of United Nations held in San Francisco in June 1965. At this gathering, as a token of appreciation and support of United Nations, the Baha International Community presented to each delegation and to some of the officials a small, beautifully finished wooden box bearing on its cover the celestial and terrestrial  globes of the world. The following message was attached: Presented in appreciation by the Baha'i International Community on the occasion of the Twentieth Anniversary

 continued to play an increasingly active role in promoting interest in United Nations activities. 

 One of the important assignments given by the Universal House of Justice to its representative  was the presentation on behalf of the Universal House of Justice of The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah to fifty-six Heads of State via their ambassadors to the United Nations. This delicate mission was carried out with great success and with but few exceptions, for reasons beyond control, all the fifty-six ambassadors received this historic document.

Over nine thousand believers assembled in six simul-taneously-held Intercontinental Conferences, deliberated on ways and means to proclaim the Divine Message of Baha'u'llah to the leaders and masses of the planet.' Thus the third phase of the Nine Year Plan, which added "proclama-tion"  to the scope of Baha'i activities, was inaugurated. In keeping with the urgency of the hour, barely a month elapsed from the close of the six Intercontinental Conferences to the announcement by the Universal House of Justice that the first Oceanic Conference would be held at Palermo, Sicily in August 1968, just prior to the commemoration of the One Hundredth Anniversary of Baha'u'llah's arrival in the Holy Land.

  SCTPJY-I-MULL2K IN ADRIANOPLE

 In the message sent by the Universal House of 

Justice at Ridvan 1965    

 to the Baha'is of the world, the preparation was called for of "...national and local plans for the befitting celebration of the centenary of Baha'u'llah's proclamation of His Message in September! October, 1867, to the kings and rulers of the world.. 

 ." and all National Spiritual Assemblies  were called upon to "consider now the appointment of National 

Proclamation Committees. 
        The worldwide Baha Community
arose to meet this challenge.

 National and local plans were made and carried out at the appointed time, and in the capitals and major cities of the world as well as in smaller towns, villages and islands public announcements of the Revelation  of Baha'u'llah were made. 

 Such events as public meetings, receptions, exhibitions, radio programmes, banquets and other activities, reported  in the press in many instances, were undertaken, initiating a universal proclamation of the Cause on a scale never before attempted. 

 On the international stage three events took place. 

 On the Feast of Ma~iyyat (September 26, 1967) six Hands of the Cause of God, representing  the Baha'i world, visited the site of Baha'u'llah's house in Adrianople where the celebrated Sariy-i-Muldk, the chief depository of His general messages to the kings had been revealed a hundred years before, and in long hours though day and night made ardent supplication for the confirmation of the activities  of the friends in the new phase of the Nine Year Plan, and indeed of the Cause itself At the same time the Universal House of Justice offered its prayers in the Shrine of Baha'u'llah. 

 From this holy and historic site these six Hands of the Cause made their ways, as the For a report on proclamation activities see page 195 of this volume.

CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES        91

 distinguished representatives of the Universal House of Justice, to the six 

InterContinental Conferences

 which had been called to commemorate  the inception of Baha'u'llah's Own proclamation of the Cause of God, to". .sound the 'opening notes' of a period of proclamation of the Cause of God. ." and to deliberate on ways to achieve the goals of the Nine Year Plan. Each Hand bore, from the World Centre, a photograph of the Blessed Beauty to be shown to the friends attending the Conferences, which are described elsewhere. 

 The Universal House of Justicecompiled and published a book entitled The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah comprising the greater part of the Sdriy-i-Mulak, Tablets to specific kings and potentates, addresses to other monarchs and rulers named in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and essential passages from His announcement to religious leaders and to mankind in general. 

 Two editions  of this volume were made, one limited to thee hundred copies with embellished text and rich binding and the other a general edition. Copies of the limited edition were presented to Hands of the Cause and to all National Spiritual  Assemblies, an adequate number being held in reserve for presentation to new National Spiritual Assemblies to be established during the Nine Year Plan. 

 One hundred and forty copies of the special edition were designated for Heads of State.2 To kings, presidents and rulers, individual letters were addressed by name and inserted in these one hundred and forty copies. 

 The gist of these letters was to call to the attention of the rulers the Message of Baha'u'llah, to refer, where relevant, to IBah~'u'11dh's Tablet to his or her predecessor, to beg the recipient not to set the message lightly aside and to assure him of prayers for his welfare and that of his country. 

 Of these one hundred and forty books, fifty-six were scheduledforpresentationthroughtheambassadors to the United Nations of the countries concerned, a task of personal interviewing discharged  with conscientious devotion by the Baha'i 

International Community's  

 accredited representative to the United Nations.

        PILGRIMAGE                 
        When the Universal House   

 of Justice decided to use for its offices the building in Haifa which had been for so many years the Western Pilgrim House, it became necessary to find other accommodation for the western pilgrims. 

 It was found possible, by sligh{ alteration, to accommodate  all the pilgrims from both east and west in the former 

Eastern Pilgrim House      
and its adjacent buildings.

 These alterations were made in time for the beginning of the pilgrimage season in November 1963. It was also decided that the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land would continue to be responsible for the pilgrimage programme. 
                           
 THE INTERNATIONAL BAHA'I   
   AUDIOVISUAL CENTRE        
   On February 21, 1967 the   

Universal House of Justice 

 announced to National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world the establishment of the International 

Baha AudioVisual Centre  

 in Victor, outside Rochester, New York. Its functions included "creating, producing, storing, indexing, marketing and distributing audiovisual materials for the benefit of the World Centre and 

National Spiritual Assemblies". 

 It was not designed, therefore, to retail to 

Local Spiritual Assemblies 

 or to individuals, but rather to act as a wholesale supplier to National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world. It was also envisaged that IBAVC would operate and be managed on a basis similar to that of the Baha Publishing Trusts, i.e., would be self-supporting. Mr. William Richter was named manager. 

 The first assignment of the International Baha'i AudioVisual Centre was to arrange for audiovisual coverage of the six Intercontinental Conferences held in October 1967. The outgrowth of that assignment was the production  and distribution of a slide programme

  entitled The Hundredth Year featuring the sights and sounds of the historic Conferences held in Kampala, Frankfurt, Panama City, New Delhi, Sydney and Chicago. 

 The Centre also reproduced and distributed copies of the sound-slide presentation Carmel — The Mountain  ofGodwhich the AudioVisual Department of the Universal House of Justice had prepared for showing at the Conferences. 

 Other early projects included assistance in distributing the Columbia Broadcasting System television film 

And His Name Shall Be     

 One to those National Assemblies which acted as hosts to the Intercontinental Conferences, and the acquisition and copyright clearance of photographs  of the kings and rulers to whom Baha'u'llah had addressed His momentous Tablets. 

 Office space and other facilities for use of the Centre were generously made available by Mr. Richter on the farm owned by him in Victor. The tenant house was converted for use as an office and workshop. Photographic laboratories, a small printing shop, and other facilities were installed in the basement of the 

Richter residence. Ample  

 space is available in other outbuildings for future expansion. 
     The counterpart of the    

International Baha'i      

 AudioVisual Centre was established at the World Centre through the creation of an AudioVisual Department responsible directly to the 

Universal House of Justice.
Mr. Juan Cab&n            

 was named secretary of the Department. 
                          
         RELATIONS  WITH THE STATE 
OF ISRAEL                 

 The State of Israel from its inception has accorded high status to the international institutions of the Faith located at the World Centre. Historically speaking, there had always been, from the time of Baha'u'llah Himself, high respect for the Faith and its leaders on the part of local government officials. 

 The rights, privileges and status granted to the Baha'is in the time of the Mandate were continued and in some respects enlarged following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. 

 The first official act of the Universal House of Justice following its election at RhjvAn 1963


<p93>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES        93

 was to send a delegation consisting of two Hands of the Cause and two members of the House of Justice to attend the State funeral of Israel's second President, Izhak Ben Zvi, which was held in Jerusalem on April 23, 1963. 

 Israel's third President, Zalman Shazar, accepted the invitation of the 

Universal House of Justice

 in the spring of 1964 to pay a formal visit to the Shrine of the BTh and the Baha'i gardens on Mount Carmel. included in the Presidential party on that occasion were 

Mrs. Shazar and Mayor     

 and Mrs. Aba Khoushy of Haifa. Later a delegation composed of Hands of the Cause and members of the Universal House of Justice returned the visit by calling on President 

Shazar at Beit Hanassi    
in Jerusalem.             

 The cordial relationship which exists between the World Centre and the State of Israel was further enhanced when 

Mark Tobey and Bernard    

 Leach each presented a piece of their work to the new Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The Mayor of Jerusalem, who is also Director of the Museum, expressed great pleasure and gratitude for these gifts from Baha'is of such fame. 

 The change in management of the various Israel 

Branches of National      

 Assemblies from the Custodians to members of the Universal House of Justice was officially accepted by the State of Israel, and in all other respects the status of the Universal House of Justice as the head of the Faith was recognized and respected. 

 In 1966 a stone wall and new entrance to the Baha cemetery in Haifa were constructed, resulting in the beautification of this treasured visiting place of Baha'i pilgrims where many outstanding early Baha'is are buried at the foot of Mount Carmel just below the cave of 

Elijah.                   
                          
WESTERN HEMISPHERE        
    Two National Spiritual    

 Assemblies were formed in the Western Hemisphere during the five-year period ending in 1968. Both were formed at Ri4vtin 

1967: Belize (British     

 Honduras)  with its seat in the city of Belize, and the Leeward, Windward and Virgin Islands with its seat in Charlotte 

Amalie. The Hawaiian      

 Islands were under the jurisdiction of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 

States until Ridvan 1964. 

 At that time a new National Assembly was formed in the Hawaiian 

Islands                   

 and the territory was transferred to Australasia. 

   The twenty-six National   
Assemblies in the Western 

Hemisphere at Ri4v&n      
1968 were:                

Alaska

 United States of America  
 Uruguay                   
 Venezuela                 

 The beginnings of mass teaching in Bolivia in the closing years of the Ten Year Crusade spread to other Latin American countries, notably Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and 

Panama. The National      

 Spiritual Assembly of Belize was able to win all its home-front teaching goals during the first year of its existence. 

 By 1968, six thousand and ninety-eight Baha'i centres had been established in the Western Hemisphere' and one thousand one hundred and seventeen Local Spiritual Assemblies  had been raised tip. A total of one hundred and sixty-five American tribes and ethnic minorities were represented in the Faith and Baha literature in fifty-eight American languages and dialects had been published. 

 The great focus of attention, however, was on Panama where, during the course of the second half of the Nine Year Plan the majestic Mashriqu'1-A~hk6r conceived by architect Peter Tillotson was to be erected on Cerro Sonsonate hill just outside Panama City. 

 Widespread use of television for proclaiming the Faith had its beginnings in the United States with the release of the Columbia 

Broadcasting  System's   

 ifim And His Name Shall Be One. Produced originally for use by the Columbia Broadcasting System in a series of religious programmes, the film was used extensively by the Baha'is throughout the world.

 National Assembly in 1965 heralded the begin-flings of a new dimension in teaching in the United States. The Hand of the Cause William Sears, assisted by Auxiliary Board members Florence 

Mayberry and Anthony       

 Lease, made outstanding contributions to the eight-month campaign. 

 The goal was to double the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies in the State. 

 An impudent and somewhat naive attempt by the followers of Mason Remey to gain possession  of all Baha'i properties and funds in the United States, including the Mother Temple of the West in Wilmette, was commenced in 1964. The first intimation of this fantastic claim was a letter from a lawyer received in the summer of that year by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States setting out the demands of the Covenant-breakers, suggesting that the whole matter could be settled without recourse to the courts, and proposing a date for discussion  of the matter. 

 On November 5, 1964 the Covenant-breakers formally ified suit in the United 

States District Court      

 for Northern Illinois, supporting their claimsby allegingthatthey werethe "orthodox" Baha and that Mason Remey was the "hereditary guardian". 

 The National Spiritual Assembly, defendant in the case, answered this claim, stating its historic and legal right to all Baha properties in the United States. 

The National Assembly      

 also filed a counterclaim asking the court to restrain the Covenant-breakers from using Baha names and symbols protected by United States trademark. 

 On March 23, 1965 the Covenant-breakers' case was dismissed on technical grounds; they filed a further suit making the same claims and this was dismissed on March 8, 1966, leaving the National Assembly's counterclaim outstanding.  This was set for trial on June 1, 1966 but the Covenant-breakers failed to appear and defend. 

 Judgement was rendered in favour of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States. 

 As a result of this action the authority and rights of the National Assembly over the properties and funds in its care were upheld by the court, and the dwindling group of Remey followers was forbidden to use those Baha'i names and symbols which by long use have become associated with the Faith ofBahA'u'lhh and its Administrative Order.'

       No new National Spiritual  

 Assemblies were formed on the European continent during the period 1963 — 1968.

 Assemblies already established were: 

Austria                    
Belgium                    
British Isles

 Europe was honoured by being the host to approximately seven thousand believers attending  the World Congress in London at Ri~1v~n 1963 — the largest gathering of Baha'is ever witnessed — and in the following year (July, 1964) the eyes of the Baha world were focused on Langenhain (near Frankfurt) on the occasion  of the dedication of the Mother Temple of Europe. 

 Outstanding recognitions for the Faith were the incorporation of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 in the predominantly Roman Catholic country of Italy, as well as in Finland and Monaco. 

 Also noteworthy was the election of a Local Spiritual Assembly on the fringes of the Arctic Circle in Reykjavik, Iceland and its incorporation. 

 By 1968 one thousand and eighty-two Baha'i centres had been established in Europe' and one hundred and eighty-two Local Spiritual Assemblies elected. 

 A new Baha'i Publishing Trust, Maison d'Edition, for the publication of Baha literature in the French language, was formed at Brussels by the Belgian National Assembly, thus accomplishing a major goal of the Nine Year 

Plan.

 with its seat in Lusaka The seat of the National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa was transferred from Tunis to Rabat. 

     By RicJv6n 1968 Baha'is    

 resided in six thousand three hundred and nineteen localities in the African continent' and two thousand and sixty-six of these had formed Local Spiritual Assemblies. A total ofsixhundred and sixty-four tribes and minority groups were represented in the membership and Bah~ 'I literature had been translated and published in one hundred and thirteen African languages and dialects. Seven National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 had been incorporated — one of them, the Indian Ocean, by legislative enactment. 

 The spectre which hung over Africa at the time of the Most Great Jubilee observance in London was the persecution of Baha in Morocco. Beginning with the arrest of four believers in Nador on April12, 1962 the number 1 Figures given include areas temporarily under the jurisdiction  of National 

Spiritual Assemblies       
in Africa.                 

 of Baha'is imprisoned in Morocco finally reached fourteen. They were eventually arraigned  on charges of(1) rebellion and disorder, (2) attacks on public security, (3) constitution of an association of criminals, (4) constitution of an association and (5) attacks on religious faith. Upon trial in December 1962, though the prosecution made no attempt to prove the charges, nine were convicted. Three were sentenced to death; five to life imprisonment; one to imprisonment for fifteen years.' 

 The sentences were appealed to the Supreme Court. 

 The focus of world public opinion, favourable to the Baha, was brought to bear on the Moroccan government. Representations were made at the United Nations; a white paper on the Moroccan persecutions was prepared and widely circulated; the public press was aroused in many countries; and 

Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies

 throughout the world appealed to King Hassan TI for the release of the prisoners.

Shortly after the Feast of Qawi the Supreme Court heard the appeals, reversed the decision of the trial court and ordered the release of the prisoners. The men were freed on Friday, December 13, 1963 following twenty months of close confinement and one year after hearing sentences of death and imprisonment imposed on them.1 Prayers of gratitude were offered throughout the world, and letters expressing gratification for the decision of the Supreme Court were written by National Spiritual Assemblies to the King.

           ASIA                      

 At the time of the launching of the Nine Year Plan six new National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 had been raised up in Asia and in the process the 

Regional National Assembly

 of South East Asia was dissolved: Indonesia with its seat in Djakarta and comprising 

Indonesia, the Mentawai   
Islands, Portuguese Timor 
and West Irian.           
  Korea with its seat in

 Philippine Islands with its seat in Manila Thailand with its seat in Bangkok and having jurisdiction over the Baha'is of Laos Vietnam with its seat in Saigon and having jurisdiction over the Baha'is of Cambodia Malaysia with its seat in Kuala Lumpur and comprising Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, Sabali and Sarawak 

     In 1966 the National Spiritual

 Assembly of Brunci was established with its seat in Brunei town, and in 1967 four additional 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 were formed in Asia, raising the total to nineteen: 

  Eastern and Southern Arabia

 with its seat in Balgayn Laos with its seat in 

Vientiane                 
  Sikkim with its seat in   

Gangtok                   
  Taiwan with its seat in   

Taipeh                    

  The mass teaching in India which had begun in the closing years of the Ten Year Crusade continued with thousands enrolling under the banner of Baha'u'llah in that country each year. 

Korea, the Philippines    

 and Vietnam also experienced the results of mass teaching, making  the Asian continent' the world leader in total 

Baha population. In      

 1968 there were seventeen thousand four hundred and ninety-nine  centres in Asia (more than half the world total) of which three thousand three hundred and seventy-three were Local Spiritual Assembly  areas. A total of two hundred and twenty-five Asian tribes and minority groups were represented in the Faith, and Baha literature had been translated and published in one hundred  and thirty-two languages and dialects. 

 One of the great victories of this period was the acquisition and possession of Chibrig, the fortress on the northern border of Persia wnere the blessed 13Th was once imprisoned and from 1     Figures given include areas temporarily under the jurisdiction  of National

 whence He was taken to His martyrdom. This achievement immensely enriched the spiritual and historical endowments of the Faith. 
                          
       AUSTRALASIA               

 At the time of the Most Great Jubilee this vast region comprised only three National Spiritual Assemblies: Australia, New Zealand and the South 

Pacific Islands. At Ri41v~n
1964 the National Spiritual

 Assembly of the Hawaiian Islands, with its seat in Honolulu, was formed, and its territory was added to this region. The 

Regional National Spiritual

 Assembly of the South Pacific Islands was dissolved and its territory divided into two National Assembly areas: South Pacific Ocean with its seat in Suva (Fiji) and comprising the Gilbert and 

Ellice Islands, Nauru     

 Island, Fiji, Western Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga and 

Cook Islands.             
  South West Pacific Ocean  

 with its seat in iloniara (Solomon Islands) and comprising  the Solomon 

Islands, the New Hebrides 
Islands, New Caledonia    
and the Loyalty Islands.  

        The National Spiritual    

 Assembly of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands was formed at RhJvAn 1967 with its seat in Tarawa. 

 By 1968 Baha'is resided in five hundred and seventy-four localities in Australasia' of which one hundred and two had formed their Local 

Spiritual Assembly. Sixty-one

 tribes and minority groups were represented among the believers of this region, and Baha'i literature had been published in forty-eight different languages and dialects. 

 One of the, outstanding achievements in Australasia during this period was the enactment  of a new law in the Solomon Islands, as a direct result of the efforts of the Baha'is, which enabled them to incorporate the National Assembly and all Local Assemblies in the Solomons. The bill was presented to the legislative  assembly in December 1964 where it received warm praise and support from government and non-government members alike. It received the assent of the Queen's official representative on December 29th of that year.

                THE LAUNCHING OF THE
                   NINE YEAR PLAN

  THE first direct reference to the Plan to begin at Ri~1vAn 1964 was made in the message of the Universal House of Justice to National Conventions  sent from 

London on 7 May 1963:      

 "The Universal House of Justice, in close consultation with the Hands of the Cause, is examining the vast range of Baha'i activity and growth in order to prepare a detailed plan of expansion for the whole DahA'i community, to be launched at Ridvan 1964... 

 "The plan to be embarked upon next Ri4vAn, the details of which will be announced during the coming year, will include such projects as the extension and embellishment of the endowments  at the World Centre; collation of the Writings of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, and Shoghi Effendi; continual reinforcement of the ties binding the Baha'i world to the United Nations; formation of many more National Spiritual Assemblies, both by division of existing  Regional 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 and the development of new Baha communities, together  with the purchase of national Jjaatu'1-Quds, Temple sites, and national endowments; the opening of new territories to the Faith; detailed plans for National Spiritual Assemblies  involving, in some areas, consolidation goals, in others the multiplication of Baha'i institutes and schools, in others a great enrichment  of Baha'i literature, and in all a vast increase in the number of IBahA'is, and the holding of oceanic and intercontinental conferences." 

 In its message of October, 1963, addressed to "The 

Followers of Baha'u'llah   

 throughout the World", the Universal House of Justice first informed the friends that the new Plan would extend over a period of nine years and announced  the formation at RhJvAn 1964 — the opening date of the Nine Year Plan — of nineteen  new National 

Spiritual Assemblies:      

 "Next Rh~v&n will be launched the second of those world-encircling enterprises destined in the course of time to carry the Word of God to every human soul. 

The Standard Bearers       

 of this Nine Year Plan are the Hands of the Cause of God. The responsibility for directing the work will rest upon the shoulders of the National Spiritual Assemblies, the generals of the Army of Light, under the guidance of the Universal House of 

Justice.                   

 "As the first step inaugurating this great undertaking we rejoice to announce the formation  next Ri~1v~n of nineteen National Spiritual Assemblies, resulting in the dissolution of six of the existing Regional National Spiritual Assemblies, and bringing the total number of these pillars of the Universal House of Justice to sixty-nine.

  "The detailed goals of the Plan, which will include sixty-nine national plans, have yet to be announced, but they must be such as to develop still further the World Centre of the Faith and the work of its institutions; to consolidate those territories which have already been opened to the Faith; to bring 

God's healing Message      

 to many more of the peoples and territories of the world including all the unopened territories of the Ten Year Crusade and all the remaining independent states of the planet; and to achieve worldwide proclamation of the Faith to mark the 

Centenary of Baha'u'llah's 

 Proclamation to the kings and rulers in 1867 — 1 868." 

 The Hands of the Cause of God had carefully  examined the condition of the Baha'i world and had analysed the victories of the beloved Guardian's 

Ten Year World Crusade. From

 this study they developed a summary of goals which, in their opinion, were attainable in the years that lay immediately ahead. 

 The results of their devoted labours were lovingly made available to the Universal House of Justice immediately after its formation, and the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land continued to offer their advice and counsel to the Universal House of Justice as it embarked upon the research, surveys and study which were the necessary prelude to the drafting of the several messages which together made up the announcement of the Nine Year Plan. 

 The text of the general message sent to the Baha'is of the world at RhulvAn 1964 read: "To the Baha'is of the

 "Dearly-loved Friends, "The divinely propelled process, described in such awe-inspiring words by our beloved Guardian, which began six thousand years ago at the dawn of the Adamic cycle and which is destined to culminate in 'the stage at which the light of God's triumphant Faith shining in all its power and glory will have suffused and


<p103>
THE LAUNCHING OF THE NINE YEAR PLAN  103

  enveloped the entire planet', is now entering its tenth and last part. 

 "The Ten Year Crusade, so recently consummated in a blaze of victory and rejoicing, constituted the entire ninth part of this process. It saw the Cause of God leap forward in one mighty decade-long effort to the point at which the foundations of its Administrative Order were laid throughout the world, thus preparing the way for that awakening of the masses which must characterize the future progress of the Faith. 

 "From the beginning of this Dispensation the most urgent summons of the Word of God, voiced successively by the flAb and Baha'u'llah, has been to teach the Cause. 'Abdu'l-Baha, in His own words, 'spent His days and nights in promoting the Cause and urging the peoples to service'. 

 Shoghi Effendi, discharging the sacred mission laid upon him, raised the 

Administrative  Order     

 of the Faith, already enshrined within the Sacred Writings, and forged it into a teaching instrument to accomplish through a succession of plans, national, international and global, the entire Divine Plan of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and he clearly foresaw in the 'tremendously long' tenth part of the process already referred to, a series of plans to be launched by the Universal House of Justice, extending over 'successive epochs of both the Formative and Golden Ages of the 

Faith'.                    

 "The first of these plans is now before us. Opening at RiQvAn 1964, while the memories of the glorious Jublice of 1963 still surge within our hearts, it must, during its nine year course, witness a huge expansion of the Cause of God and universal participation by all believers in the life of that Cause. 

 "At the World Centre of the Faith the tasks of the Plan include publication of a synopsis and codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy Book; formulation of the Constitution of the 

Universal House of Justice;

 development of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause of God, in consultation with the body of the Hands of the Cause, with a view to the extension into the future of its appointed functions of protection and propagation; continued collation  and classification of the Baha'i Sacred Scriptures as well as of the writings of Shoghi Effendi; continued efforts directed towards the emancipation of the Faith from the fetters of religious orthodoxy and its recognition as an independent religion; the preparation of a plan for the befitting development and beautification of the entire area of Baha property surrounding the Holy Shrines; extension of the existing gardens on Mount Carmel; development of the relationship between the Baha Community and the United Nations; the holding of oceanic and intercontinental conferences; the coordination of worldwide plans to commemorate, in 1967/68, the centenary of Baha'u'llah's Proclamation to the kings and rulers which centred round His revelation of the Sariy-i-Muldk in Adrianople. 

 "In the world community the Plan involves the opening of seventy virgin territories and the resettlement of twenty-four; the raising of the number of National SpirituaL Assemblies, the pillars sustaining the Universal House of Justice, to one hundred and eight, nine times the number which embarked on the first historic  World Crusade in 1953; increasing the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies to over thirteen thousand seven hundred, scattered throughout the territories and islands of the world, at least one thousand seven hundred of them to be incorporated; the raising of the number of localities where Baha reside to over fifty-four thousand; the building of two more Mashriqu'l-Adhkar's one in Asia and one in Latin America; the acquisition of thirty-two Teaching Institutes, fifty-two national IjIa4-ratu'I-Quds, fifty-four national endowments and sites for sixty-two future Temples; wide extension of recognition by civil authorities of the Baha'i 

Holy Days and Baha'i       
Marriage Certificates;     

 the translation of literature into one hundred and thirty-three more languages, and its enrichment in major languages into which translations have already been made; the establishment of four new Baha Publishing Trusts, and a vast increase in the financial resources of the Faith. 

 "The healthy development of the Cause requires that this great expansion be accompanied  by the dedicated effort of every believer in teaching, in living the Baha'i life, in corm tributing to the Fund, and particularly in the persistent effort to understand more and more the significance of Baha'u'llah's Revelation. 

 In the words of our beloved Guardian, 'One thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the extent to which our own


<p104>
104                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 inner life and private character mirror forth in their manifold aspects the splendour of those eternal principles proclaimed by Baha'u'llah'. 

 "Expansion and universal participation are the twin objectives of this initial phase of the second epoch of the Divine Plan, and all the goals assigned to the sixty-nine National Communities  are contributory to them. The process of cooperation between National Spiritual Assemblies, already initiated by the beloved Guardian, will, during the course of this Plan, apply to over two hundred specific projects and will further strengthen this process which may well assume great importance in future stages of the Formative 

Age.                       

 "Once more, dear friends, we enter the battle but with an incomparably greater array than that which embarked upon the World Crusade in 1953. 

 To that small force of twelve national communities, now veteran campaigners, have been added fifty-seven new legions, each under the generalship of a National Spiritual Assembly,  each destined to become a veteran of this and future campaigns. That Crusade began with slightly more than six hundred Local Spiritual Assemblies, the greater part of which were situated in Persia, North America and Europe; the home fronts now comprise nearly four thousand six hundred Local Spiritual Assemblies  scattered throughout the continents and islands of the world. 

 We begin this Plan with a tremendous momentum, exemplified by the addition, since last RiQv&n, of over four thousand new centres and thirteen National Spiritual Assemblies, and by the beginning, in several countries, of that entry by troops into the Cause of God prophesied by 'Abdu'l-Baha and so eagerly anticipated by 

Him.                       
  "The Standard Bearers      

 of this Nine Year Plan are those same divinely appointed, tried and victorious souls who bore the standard of the World Crusade, the Hands of the Cause of God, whose advice and consultation have been invaluable in the working out of this Nine Year Plan. Supported by their 'deputies, assistants and advisers', the members of the Auxiliary Boards, they will inspire and protect the Army of God, lead through every breach to the limit of available resources and sustain those communities  struggling over intractable or stony ground, so that by 1973 the celebrations befitting  the centenary of the Revelation of the Most Holy Book may be undertaken by a victorious, firmly established, organically united world community, dedicated to the service of God and the final triumph of His Cause. 

 "Therefore let each of the sixty-nine communities seize its tasks, at once consider how best to accomplish them within the allotted span, raise its band of pioneers, consecrate itself to unremitting labour and set out on its mission. Now is the golden opportunity. Eor whatever convulsions the waywardness of a godless and materialistic age may yet precipitate in the world, however grievous may be the effects of the rolling up of the present order on the plans and efforts of the Community of the Most Great Name, we must seize the opportunities of the hour and go forward confident that all things are within His mighty grasp and that, if we but play our part, total and unconditional victory will inevitably be ours." 

  Each of the sixty-nine National Spiritual Assemblies, as indicated abc ye, received a separate message setting forth the details of their respective goals, and these, together with the World Centre goals, are summarized in the following analysis:

136                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Supplementary goals were added during the course of the Nine Year Plan, being, for the most part, assignments to new National Spiritual Assemblies at the time of their formation. 

 Even before announcing the Nine Year Plan the 

Universal House of Justice 

 began calling attention to several important factors which would, of necessity, affect the progress of the teaching and consolidation work. 

 One of these factors was the Fund: 

Haifa                      
18 December 1963           

 "With the rapid approach of the launching of the 

Nine Year Plan, the Universal

 House of Justice feels that it is timely to lay clearly before the Baha'is of all countries the needs of the Fund at all its levels: local, national, continental, and international. 

 "The continual expansion of the Faith and the diversification of the activities of Baha'i communities make it more and more necessary for every believer to ponder carefully his responsibilities and contribute as much and as regularly as he or she can. Contributing to the Fund is a service that every believer can render, be he poor or wealthy; for this is a spiritual responsibility in which the amount given is not important. It is the degree of the sacrifice of the giver, the love with which he makes his gift, and the unity of all the friends in this service which bring spiritual confirmations. As the beloved Guardian wrote in August 1957: 'All, no matter how modest their resources, must participate. 

 Upon the degree of self-sacrifice involved  in these individual contributions will directly depend the efficacy and the spiritual influence which these nascent administrative institutions, called into being through the power of Baha'u'llah, and by virtue of the design conceived by the Centre of His Covenant,  will exert.' 

 "Not only the individual's responsibility to contribute is important at this time, but also the uses to which the Fund is put and the areas in which it is expended. 

 "Much of the present rapid expansion of the Faith is taking place in areas of great poverty where the believers, however much they sacrifice, cannot produce sufficient funds to sustain the work. It is these very areas Which are the most fruitful in teaching, and a sum of money spent here will produce ten times — even a hundred times — the results obtainable in other parts of the world. Yet in the past months the Universal House of Justice has had to refuse a number of appeals for assistance from such areas because there just was not enough money in the International 

Fund.                      

 "It should therefore be the aim of every local and national community to become not only self-supporting, but to expend its funds with such wisdom and economy as to be able to contribute substantially to the 

Baha'i International      

 Fund, thus enabling the House of Justice to aid the work in fruitful but impoverished  areas, to assist new National Assemblies  to start their work, to contribute to major international undertakings of the Nine Year Plan such as oceanic conferences, and to carry forward the work of beautifying the land surrounding  the Holy Shrines at the World Centre of the Faith. 

 "Nor should the believers, individually or in their assemblies, forget the vitally important continental funds which provide for the work of the Hands of the Cause of God and their Auxiliary Boards. 

 This divine institution, so assiduously fostered by the Guardian, and which has already played a unique role in the history of the Faith, is destined to render increasingly important services in the years to come. 

 "In the midst of a civilization torn by strifes and enfeebled by materialism, the people of BaM are building a new world. We face at this time opportunities and responsibilities of vast magnitude and great urgency. Let each believer  in his inmost heart resolve not to be seduced by the ephemeral allurements of the society around him, nor to be drawn into its feuds and shortlived enthusiasms, but instead to transfer all he can from the old world to that new one which is the vision of his longing and will be the fruit of his labours." 

 Shortly after the Plan was inaugurated the Universal House of Justice, conscious of a new dimension in teaching, dispatched a list of suggestions to National Spiritual Assemblies on the important subject of teaching the masses, and accompanied it with the following message: "When the masses of mankind are awakened and enter the Faith of God, a new process is set in motion and the growth of a new civilization begins. Witness the emergence of Christianity


<p137>
THE LAUNCHING OF THE NINE YEAR PLAN  137

 and of Isldm. These masses are the rank and file, steeped in traditions of their own, but receptive to the new Word of God, by which, when they truly respond to it, they become so influenced as to transform those who come in contact with them. 

 "God's standards are different from those of men. According to men's standards, the acceptance  of any cause by people of distinction, of recognized faire and status, determines the value and greatness of that cause. But, in the words of Baha'u'llah: 'The summons and Message  which We gave were never intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind  in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever has been revealed and vouchsafed unto it.' Or again, 'He has endowed every soul with the capacity to recognize the signs of God. How could He, otherwise, have fulfilled His testimony unto men, if ye be of them that ponder His Cause in their hearts.' In countries where teaching the masses has succeeded, the I3ah&'is have poured out their time and effort in village areas to the same extent as they had formerly done in cities and towns. 

 The results indicate how unwise it is to concentrate solely on one section of the population. Each National Assembly therefore should so balance its resources and harmonize its efforts that the Faith of God is taught not only to those who are readily accessible but to all sections of society, however remote they may be. 

 "The unsophisticated people of the world —  and they form the large majority of its population  — have the same right to know of the Cause of God as others. When the friends are teaching the Word of God they should be careful  to give the Message in the same simplicity as it is enunciated in our teachings. In their contacts they must show genuine and divine love. The heart of an unlettered soul is extremely  sensitive; any trace of prejudice on the part of the pioneer or teacher is immediately sensed. 

 "When teaching among the masses, the friends should be careful not to emphasize the charitable and humanitarian aspects of the Faith as a means to win recruits. 

 Experience has shown that when facilities such as schools, dispensari~, hospitals, or even clothes and food are offered to the people being taught, many complications arise. 

 The prime motive should always be the response of man to Gad's Message, and therecognition of His Messenger. Those who declare themselves as Baha'is should become enchanted with the beauty of the teachings, and touched by the love of Baha'u'llah. 

 The declarants need not know all the proofs, history, laws, and principles of the Faith, but in the process of declaring themselves  they must, in addition to catching the spark of faith, become basically informed about the Central Figures of the Faith, as well as the existence of laws they must follow and an administration they must obey. 

 "After declaration, the new believers must not be left to their own devices. Through correspondence and dispatch of visitors, though conferences and training courses, these friends must be patiently strengthened and lovingly helped to develop into full Baha'i maturity. The beloved Guardian, referring to the duties of Baha'i assemblies in assisting the newly declared believer, has written:'.. 

 the members of each and every assembly should endeavour, by their patience, their love, their tact and wisdom,  to nurse, subsequent to his admission, the newcomer into Baha'i maturity, and win him over gradually to the unreserved acceptance of whatever has been ordained in the teachings.' 

 "Expansion and consolidation are twin processes  that must go hand in hand. 

 The friends must not stop expansion in the name of consolidation.  Deepening the newly enrolled believers generates tremendous stimulus which results in further expansion. 

 The enrollment of new believers, on the other hand, creates a new spirit in the community and provides additional potential manpower that will reinforce the consolidation work... 

 "We are fervently praying that all National and Local Spiritual Assemblies, supported by the individual believers, will achieve outstanding  success in the fulfilment of this glorious objective." 

 The principle of universal participation, first alluded to by the Universal House of Justice in its message of 7 May 1963, was another important  factor affecting the progress of the Cause which was made the subject of a special appeal: 

Haifa                     
September, 1964           

 "In our message to you of April 1964, announcing the Nine Year Plan, we called attention  to two major themes of that Plan, namely


<p138>
138                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 .... a huge expansion of the Cause of God and universal participation by all believers in the life of that Cause.' 

 "The enthusiastic vigour with which the believers throughout the world, under the devoted guidance of their National Spiritual Assemblies, have arisen to meet the challenge of the Plan, augurs well for the huge expansion called for. 

 We now ask you to bend your efforts and thoughts, with equal enthusiasm, to the requirements of universal participation. 

 "In that same message we indicated the meaning of universal participation: the dedicated effort of every believer in teaching, in living the Baha'i life, in contributing to the Fund, and particularly in the persistent effort to understand more and more the significance of 

Baha'u'llah's Revelation.    

 In the words of our beloved Guardian, "One thing and only one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely, the extent to which our own inner life and private character mirror forth in their manifold aspects the splendour of those eternal principles proclaimed by Baha'u'llah."' "'Regard the world as the human body,' wrote 

Baha'u'llah to Queen Victoria.

 We can surely regard the Baha world, the Army of God, in the same way. 

 In the human body, every cell, every organ, every nerve has its part to play. 

 When all do so the body is healthy, vigorous, radiant, ready for every call made upon it. No cell, however humble, lives apart from the body, whether in serving it or receiving from it. This is true of the body of mankind in which God 'has endowed each humble being with ability and talent,' and is supremely true of the body of the Baha world community, for this body is already an organism, united in its aspirations, unified in its methods, seeking assistance and confirmation from the same Source, and illumined with the conscious knowledge of its unity. Therefore, in this organic,  divinely guided, blessed, and illumined body the participation of every believer is of the utmost importance, and is a source of power and vitality as yet unknown to us. For extensive and deep as has been the sharing in the glorious work of the Cause, who would claim that every single believer has succeeded in finding his or her fullest satisfaction in the life of the Cause? The Baha world community, growing like a healthy new body, develops new cells, new organs, new functions and powers as it presses on to its maturity, when every soul, living for the Cause of God, will receive from that Cause, health, assurance, and the overflowing bounties of Baha'u'llah which are diffused though His divinely ordained 

Order.                     

 "In addition to teaching, every believer can pray. 

 Every believer can strive to make his 'oxvn inner life and private character minor forth in theft manifold aspects the splendour of those eternal principles proclaimed by Baha'u'llah.' Every believer can contribute to the Fund. Not all believers can give public talks, not all are called upon to serve on administrative institutions.  But all can pray, fight their own spiritual battles, and contribute to the Fund. If every believer will carry out these sacred duties, we shall be astonished at the accession of power which will result to the whole body, and which in its turn will give rise to further growth and the showering of greater blessings on all of us. "The real secret of universal participation lies in the Master's oft-expressed wish that the friends should love each other, constantly encourage each other, work together, be as one soul in one body, and in so doing become a true, organic, healthy body animated and illumined  by the spirit. In such a body all will receive spiritual health and vitality from the organism itself, and the most perfect flowers and fruits will be brought forth. 

 "Our prayers for the happiness and success of the friends everywhere are constantly offered at the Holy Shrines." 

 Of supreme importance to the winning of the teaching goals was the raising and settling of hundreds of pioneers in the far-flung goal areas of the world. 

 During the period covered by this report (196t — 1968) three calls for pioneers were made. The first was at Ri4vttn 1965: "Four challenging and immediate tasks present themselves. The first is to raise and dispatch, during the coming year, no less than four hundred and sixty pioneers who will open the fifty-four remaining virgin territories of the Plain resettle the eighteen unoccupied ones, reinforce areas where the numbers and cohesion  of the Baha communities are at present inadequate to launch effective teaching plans, and support and extend the work in the areas of mass teaching. 

 Let every believer consider this challenge, be he, in the words of the beloved Guardian, 'in active service or not, of either


<p139>
THE LAUNCHING OF THE NINE YEAR PLAN  139

 sex, young as well as old, rich or poor, whether veteran or newly enrolled...' 

 ..... A careful estimate has been made of the pioneer needs of every area during the next twelve months and the result, including those for the seventy-two areas mentioned above, is a call for four hundred and sixty-one pioneers; eighty-six for Africa, ninety-six for the Americas,  one hundred and ninety-one for Asia, twenty-nine for Australasia, and fifty-nine for Europe. Each National Spiritual Assembly has been consulted as to its pioneer needs and these have been made known to all National Spiritual Assemblies... 

 The friends, therefore, are urged to consult their National Spiritual Assemblies for information about pioneer needs and responsibilities both of their own communities and in general." 

 The second call for pioneers, reinforcing and supplementing the first, was in the form of a cablegram on 

11 December 1965:          

 "Announce all believers rejoice response Baha'i world pioneer call raised Ri4v6n message  requiring four hundred sixty pioneers course current year. Thus far ninety-three settled posts including fifteen virgin territories: St. Andres Island, Providencia Island, Marmara  Island, Chad, Niger, Cayman Islands, Thrks and Caicos, Ischia, Gotland, Alaska Peninsula, Barbuda, St. Kitts-Nevis, Inner Hebrides, Bornholm, Capri. Thirtyfive additional  settled same goals. One hundred sixty-seven more arisen and in process settling. Total two hundred ninety-five souls responded call. Further two hundred believers needed next four swiftly passing months fill remaining goals.

 Virgin and resettlement territories priority. 

 Confident spirit devotion friends glorious Faith ensure brilliant victory this primary objective so vital Nine Year Plan." 

 The third call for pioneers was raised at Ridvan 1967: "The brilliant pioneering feat of the second year of the Plan is beginning to reveal its beneficent effects, but pioneers are still urgently needed and will coniinue to be needed in all parts of the world for consolidation and development of the Faith in the newly won territories as well as for those resettled during the opening years of the Plan. The immediate requirement is for 209 pioneers to settle in eighty-seven territories named on the attached list, and the call is now raised for the speedy achievement of this task. Service in this highly meritorious field is open to every believer and all those who are moved to respond to this particular  call are asked to consult the list of territories  and to make their offers to their own National Spiritual 

Assembly."                 

 Two new developments in connection with the settling of pioneers were announced at Ridvan 1965 viz., the appointment of Continental Pioneer Committees and the inauguration  of an 

International Deputization 
Fund:                      

 "To assist the pioneer efforts of the friends and their transfer to their posts during the next twelve months we announce the formation of five Continental Pioneer Committees, namely: 

Pioneer Committee for Africa'

 appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the British 

Isles; Pioneer Committee   

 for the Americas appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of the United 

States; Pioneer Committee  

 for Asia appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia; Pioneer Committee for Australasia appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia; Pioneer Committee for Europe appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of Germany. 

 "These committees will in no way infringe upon the responsibilities of other pioneer committees, or of National Spiritual Assemblies, who are in charge of the teaching work, and under whose jurisdiction they will function. They are established to facilitate and assist the work of these national bodies by providing effective exchange of vital information, both continentally and intercontinentally, by assisting  in the routeing of pioneer offers, and in the transfer of pioneers to their posts... 

 "For the first time in Baha'i history, an International Deputization Fund has been established at the World Centre under the administration  of the 

Universal I-louse of Justice.

  'Responsibility for appointing the Pioneer Committee for Africawas subsequently transferred to the National 

Spiritual                  

 Assembly of Uganda and Central Africa and all 

National                   

 Assemblies were advised by letter dated 18 March 1966.


<p140>
140                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 From it supplementary support will be given to specific pioneering projects when other funds are not available. 

 All friends, and particularly those who are unable to respond to the pioneer call, are invited to support this Fund, mindful of the injunction of Baha'u'llah, 'Centre your energies in the propagation of the Faith of God. Whoso is worthy of so high a calling, let him arise and promote it. Whoso is unable, it is his duty to appoint him who will, in his stead, proclaim this Revelation, Whose power bath caused the foundation of the mightiest structures to quake, every mountain to be crushed into dust, and every soul to be dumbfounded.'" A call for travelling teachers was made at RiQvAn 1966: "The Universal House of Justice attaches such importance to this principle of travelling teaching that it has decided to develop it internationally, and now calls for volunteers to offer their services in this field. By their visits to lands other than their own, these friends will lend a tremendous stimulus to the proclamation and teaching of the Cause in all continents. It is hoped that such projects will be self-supporting, since the International Deputization Fund will still be needed for pioneering. However, when a proposal which is considered to be of special benefit to the Faith cannot be financed by the individual or the receiving National 

Assemblies,  the House    

 of Justice will consider a request  for assistance from the Deputization Fund. 

 Offers, which may be for any period, should be made to one's own National Spiritual Assembly or to the Continental Pioneer Committees,  which have been given the additional task of assisting National Assemblies to implement and coordinate this new enterprise. Let those who arise recall the Master's injunction to 'travel like 'Abdu'l-Baha... sanctified and free from every attachment and in the utmost severance.'" In that same message the 

Universal House of Justice 

 called the attention of all the friends to their individual responsibilities toward the advancement of the Cause: "The challenge to the individual Baha in every field of service, but above all in teaching the Cause of God, is neverending. 

 With every fresh affliction visited upon mankind our inescapable  duty becomes more apparent, nor should we ever forget that if we neglect this duty, 'others', in the words of Shoghi Effendi, 'will be called upon to take up our task as ministers to the crying needs of this afflicted world.' 

 Now, it seems, we may well be entering an era of the longed-for expansion of our beloved Faith. Mankind's growing hunger for spiritual truth is our opportunity. 

 While reaching  forth to grasp it, we would do well to ponder the following words of Baha'u'llah: 'Your behaviour towards your neighbour should be such as to manifest clearly the signs of the one true God, for ye are the first among men to be recreated by His Spirit, the first to adore and bow the knee before Him, the first to circle round His throne of Glory.' 

  "As humanity plunges deeper into that condition  of which Baha'u'llah wrote, 'to disclose it now would not be meet and seemly,' so must the believers increasingly stand out as assured, orientated, and fundamentally happy beings, conforming to a standard which, in direct contrast  to the ignoble and amoral attitudes of modern society, is the source of.their honour, strength, and maturity. It is this marked contrast  between the vigour, unity, and discipline of the Baha community on the one hand, and the increasing confusion, despair, and feverish tempo of a doomed society on the other, which during the turbulent years ahead, will draw the eyes of humanity to the sanctuary of Baha'u'llah's world-redeeming Faith. 

 "The constant progress of the Cause of God is a source ofjoy to us all and a stimulus to further action. But not ordinary action. Heroic deeds are now called for such as are performed oniy by divinely sustained and detached souls. 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Commander of the hosts of the Lord, in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, uttered this cry: 'Oh! 

 that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions and, raising the caltof YdBahd'u'l-Ablid in cities, villages, mountains, deserts, and oceans,promote the Divine Teachings. 
This, alas, I cannot do.   

 How intensely I deplore it.' And He concluded with this heart-shaking appeal, 'Please God, ye may achieve it.' The Nine Year Plan was effectively launched. There follows in the next section a statistical summary of the accomplishments of the Baha'i world in the course of the first four years of that Plan.

  He Who is the King of Kings hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning you unto Himself.. Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath created you through a wordfrom Him, and ordained you to be,for all time, the emblems of His sovereignty. Baha'u'llah 

         1. THE PROCLAMATION OF BAHA'U'LLAH

HAVING declared His Mission

 to His followers in Baghdad during those memorable days in the spring of 1863, it remained for Baha'u'llah to proclaim that same Mission to the world's secular and ecclesiastical leaders. "This historic Proclamation was made at a time when the Faith was in the throes of a crisis of extreme violence," writes Shoghi Effendi in God Passes By, "and it was in the main addressed to the kings of the earth, and to the Christian and Muslim ecclesiastical leaders who, by virtue of their immense prestige, ascendancy and authority, assumed an appal-lung  and inescapable responsibility for the immediate destinies of their subjects and followers.~~ "The initial phase of that Proclamation," Shoghi Effendi continues, "may be said to have opened in Constantinople with the communication  (the text of which we, alas, do not possess) addressed by 

Baha'u'llah to Su1t~n 'Abdu'1-'Aziz

 himself, the self-styled vicar of the Prophet of Is1~m and the absolute ruler of a mightyempire. 

 So potent, so august apersonage was the first among the sovereigns of the world to receive the Divine Summons, and the first among Oriental monarchs to sustain the impact of God's retributive justice. The occasion for this communication was provided by the infamous edict the Su1t~n had promulgated, less than four months after the arrival of the exiles in his capital, banishing them, suddenly and without any justification whatsoever, in the depth of winter, and in the most humiliating circumstances, to Adrianople, situated on the extremities of his empire." 

 The following monarchs, and the Pope, were addressed by name, all, except Francis Joseph, being sent one or more individual Tablets.

 The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, a compilation of His Own announcements, made one hundred years ago, to the kings and ecciesisatical leaders of the world and to mankind in general, was published by the Universal House of Justice in 1967 to mark the centenary of the inception of that proclamation. A limited deluxe edition was printed for presentation to today's kings and rulers.

 "Observe, 0 king, with thine inmost heart and with thy whole being, the precepts s of God, and walk not in the paths of the oppressor... Shouldst thou cause rivers ofiustice to spread their waters amongst thy subjects, God would surely aid thee with the hosts of the unseen and of the seen, and would strengthen thee in thine affairs... Overstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly with them that serve thee."

  Su1t~n 'Abdu'1-'Aziz was deposed after a palace revolution, condemned by sentence of the Mufti in his own capital, and four days later assassinated (1876). The war of 1914 — 18 resulted in the dissolution of the Ottoman empire, the abolition of the sultanate, the proclamation of a republic, and the sounding of the death-knell of a rulership that had endured for more than six centuries.

  Alter suffering several attempts on his life, Nicolaevitch Alexander II, Czar of Russia, died at the hand of an assassin. The harsh policy of repression he initiated in the latter part of his reign and which his successors maintained, led eventually to a revolution which swept away on a bloody tide the empire of the Czars, bringing in its wake war, disease and famine, which led to the establishment of a militant proletariat which massacred the nobility, persecuted d the clergy, drove away the intellectuals, disendowed the state religion, executed the Czar with his consort and family, and forever extinguished the dynasty of the Roinanoffs.

  Napoleon III, the most august monarch of his day in the West, sustained ignominious defeat at the Battle of Sedan (1870), an event which marked one of the greatest military capitulations recorded in modern history. He lost his kingdom and spent the remaining years of his life in exile; his much vaunted empire collapsed, a ferocious civil war ensued, and the crowning of William I, the Prussian King, as Emperor of a unified Germany, took place in the Palace of Versailles.

  The undisputed head of the most powerful Church in Christendom was cQmpelled to submit himself to dispossession of the Papal States and of Rome itself, over which the Papal flag had flown for one thousand years, and to witness the humiliation of the religious orders under his jurisdiction, adding mental anguish to his physical infirmities and embittering his latter years. The virtual extinction of the Pope's temporal sovereignty was signalized by the formal recognition of the Kingdom of Italy subsequently exacted from one of his successors in the Vatican.

  William I, conqueror of Napoleon III, sustained two attempts on his life. 

 His throne was bequeathed to William II whose pride and shortsightedness engulfed Europe in the Great War of 1914 — 18 which in turn precipitated swift and sudden revolution in the German capital. Communism appeared in a number of cities; the princes of the German states abdicated. Fleeing ignominiously to Holland, William II was compelled to relinquish his right to the throne. The constitution of Weimar marked the extinction of the empire, giving rise to a treaty whose severe terms provoked "the lamentations" " prophesied by Baha'u'llah half a century before.


<p204>
204                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 In addition to the foregoing summons to individual kings and rulers, Baha'u'llah proclaimed  His Message in Tablets and other passages in His Writings addressed to the kings and rulers collectively, to the "Rulers of America and the Presidents in every land," to the world's religious leaders, to the clergy and people of various faiths, and in the Great Announcement to mankind. 

 "A glance at the Writings of the Author of the Baha 

 Revelation," wrote Shoghi 

 Effendi,' "will reveal the important and significant fact that He Who addressed collectively an immortal message to all the kings of the earth, Who revealed a Tablet to each of the outstanding  crowned heads of Europe and Asia, Who issued His call to the sacerdotal leaders of IsUm, both sunni and ~i'ih, Who did not exclude  from His purview the Jews and the Zoroastrians, has, apart from His numerous and repeated exhortations and warnings to the entire Christian world, directed particular messages, some general, others precise and challenging, to the heads, as well as to the rank and file, of the ecclesiastical orders of Christendom  — its pope, its kings, it patriarchs, its archbishops, its bishops, its priests, and its monks." 

 "Never since the beginning of the world," Baha'u'llah testified, "hath the Message been so openly proclaimed." 
                           
         2.     DELIVERY OF THE PROCLAMATION
           TO TODAY'S HEADS OF STATE

  In its introduction to the compilation of Baha'u'llah's announcements to the many categories of humanity, as well as individual rulers, whom He addressed, the Universal House of Justice wrote: One hundred years ago, Baha'u'llah, Founder  of the Baha Faith, proclaimed in clear and unmistakable language, to the kings and rulers of the world, to its religious leaders, and to mankind  in general that the long-promised age of world peace and brotherhood had at last dawned and that He Himself was the Bearer of the new message and power from God which would transform the prevailing system ~f ~mtagonism and enmity between men and create the spirit and form of the destined world order. 

 At that time the splendour and panoply of the monarchs reflected the vast power which they exercised, autocratically for the most part, over the greater portion of the earth. Baha'u'llah, an exile from His native Persia for His religious teaching, was the prisoner of the tyrannical, all-powerful SultAn of the Ottoman Empire. In such circumstances He addressed  the rulers of the world. His Tablets to particular kings and to the Pope, although delivered, were either ignored or rejected, their wise counsels and dire warnings went unheeded, and in one instance the bearer was cruelly tortured and killed. 

1 The Promised Day is Come.

 Baha'u'llah, viewing that old world and seeing  it "at the mercy of rulers so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best advantage" declared that ". the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is daily increasing.  The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably defective." 

 Although painting in sombre tones the 'divine chastisement' which would assail most of those rulers and engulf in ruin the peoples of the world, He nevertheless left no doubt about the outcome. "Soon", He declared, "will the present day order be rolled up anda new one spread out in its stead." Since the ascension of Baha'u'llah in 1892, in the Holy Land, the rolling up of the old order has become  the daily experience of mankind and no abatement of this process is descernible. 

 The essence of Baha'u'llah's World Order is the unity of the human race. "0 ye children of men", He writes, "the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and Ills Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race. ." And He warns, "The wellbeing of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established." The achievement of this unity is Baha'u'llah's declared mission and the aim of all Baha activity. Its outline and structure are indicated in the following passage from the writings of


<p205>
PROCLAMATION OF THE BAEA'i FAITH   205

 Shoghi Effendi, great-grandson of Baha'u'llah and Guardian of the Baha'i Faith: The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha'u'llah, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. 

 This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees  of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as~ shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted  by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system. A mechanism of world intercommunication will be devised, embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity.  A world metropolis will act as the nerve centre of a world civilization, the focus towards  which the unifying forces of life will converge and from which its energizing influences  will radiate. 

 A world language will either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary to their mother tongue. 

 A world script, a world literature, a uniform and universal system of currency, of weights and measures, will simplify and facilitate intercourse and understanding among the nations and races of mankind. In such a world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces in human life, will be reconciled, will cooperate, and will harmoniously develop. The press will, under such a system, while giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and convictions of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private or public, and will be liberated from the influence of contending governments and peoples. 

 The economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will be coordinated and developed, and the distribution of its products will be equitably regulated. 

 National rivalries, hatreds and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity, understanding  and cooperation. 

 The causes of religious strife will be permanently removed, economic barriers and restrictions will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes will be obliterated. 

 Destitution  on the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear. The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the range of human inventions and technical development, to the increase of the productivity  of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising of the standard of physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race. 

 A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising unchallengeable authority  over its unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation — such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving. 

 Baha'u'llah's message is one of hope, of love, of practical reconstruction. 

 Today we reap the appalling results of our forebears' rejection of His divine call; but today there are new rulers, new people, who perchance may hear and avoid

 or mitigate the severity of impending catastrophe. 

 It is with this hope and believing it to be its sacred duty, that the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Baha'i Faith, proclaims again, through publication  of these selected passages, the essence of that mighty call of a century ago. 

 In the same hope and belief the Baha throughout the world will do their utmost during this centenary period to bring to the attention of their fellowmen  the redeeming fact of this new outpouring of divine guidance and love. We believe they will not labour in vain. 

Haifa, 1967                

 A special limited edition of this book was printed1 and presented individually to one hundred and forty Heads of State. In each volume so presented was pasted a personal letter addressed by name to the ruler or president.  Fifty-five of these were sent through the courtesy of the country's ambassador to the United Nations, the remainder being delivered either personally by a delegation from the Baha'i community in each country, by a special representative of the Universal House of Justice or, in the case of two or three copies, by post. Most copies were courteously acknowledged.

    3. PROCLAMATION TO MANKIND IN GENERAL

  The first mention of a worldwide proclamation effort was made by the Universal House of Justice in its message to the Baha'i world at 

Ri4vAn 1966:              

 The splendid achievements in the pioneering and teaching fields, together with the enthusiastic attention given to the preparation of plans for the befitting celebration of the centenary of Baha'u'llah's 

Proclamation of His Message

 to the kings and rulers of the world, have sealed with success the first, and opened the way for the second phase of the Nine Year Plan, a phase in which the Baha'i world must prepare and arm itself for the third phase, beginning in October 1967 when the six intercontinental conferences' will sound the "opening notes" of a period of proclamation of the Cause of God extending through the remaining years of the Nine Year Plan to the centenary, in 1973, of the revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. The threefold purpose of these conferences is to commemorate  the centenary of the opening of BahA'u'-liAli's  own Proclamation of His Mission, to proclaim the Divine Message, and to deliberate upon the tasks of the remaining years of the Nine Year 

Plan.                     

 A year later, at Ri4lvAn 1967, the specific task was set: As we approach the third phase of the Nine Year Plan there opens before us a prospect of enthralling opportunities such as to thrill the heart of every ardent follower of Baha'u'llah. For more than a century we have toiled to teach the Cause; heroic sacrifices, dedicated services, prodigious efforts have been made in order to establish the outposts of the Faith in the chief countries, territories, and islands of the earth and to raise the framework of the Administrative Order around the planet. 

 But the Faith of Baha'u'llah remains, as yet, unknown to the generality of men. Now at last, at long last, the worldwide community of the Most Great Name is called upon to launch, on a global scale and to every stratum of human society, an enduring and intensive proclamation  of the healing message that the Promised One has come and that the unity and wellbeing of the human race is the purpose of His Revela-A report of these Intercontinental Conferences appears on pp.221 etseq. 

 tion. This long-to-be-sustained campaign, commencing next October in commemoration of the centenary of the sounding of the "open-ing notes" of Baha'u'llah's own Proclamation, and gathering momentum throughout the remainder of the Nine Year Plan, may well become the spearhead of other plans to be launched continually until humanity has recognized and gratefully acclaimed its Redeemer  and its 

Lord.                     

 A hundred years ago Baha'u'llah Himself addressed the kings, rulers, religious leaders, and peoples of the world. The Universal House of Justice feels it its bounden duty to bring that Message to the attention of the world leaders today. 

 It is therefore presenting to them, in the form of a book, the essence of Baha'u'llah's announcement. Entitled The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, a special edition will be presented to Heads of State' during the opening of the proclamation period and a general edition will be available to the friends in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish... 

 Worldwide proclamation, the unknown sea on which we must soon sail, will add another dimension to our work, a dimension which will, as it develops, complement and reinforce the twin processes of expansion and consolidation. This pattern of teaching, emerging so soon after the completion of the framework of the Administrative Order, may well be the means of advancing the vital work of consolidation and of rendering more effective the teaching wisdom which has been gained in a hundred years, and more particularly since the beloved Guardian called us to systematic and planned activity. Therefore, in those countries where we are free to publicize our religion, this activity must become  part of our regular work, included in budgets, assigned to national and local committees for study and implementation and above all for coordination with the programs operating to achieve the goals of the Nine Year Plan. 

 Every effort of proclamation must be sustained by teaching, particularly locally, where public announcements should be related to such efforts. This coordination is essential, 1 See p. 204 for further report on the presentation of The 

Proclamation of Baha'u'llah

 to today's kings and rulers.

  for nothing will bemore disheartening than for form of activity. National and local communi-thousands thousands to hear of the Faith and have no-ties  made long-ranging plans to deliver the where to turn for further information, message of Baha'u'llah to their countrymen, The Baha'is of the world embarked with using all means of communication available to great enthusiasm on this new and satisfying them. 

    ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH
   ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF
           BAHA'U'LLAH

  November 12, 1967, will mark the 150th anniversary of Baha'u'llah's birth. We call the entire Baha'i world to joyful celebration, befitting an event so momentous to the fortunes of humanity. 

  The Universal House of Justice feels that the coincidence e of this great occasion with the opening of the proclamation period provides a splendid opportunity for bringing to public attention both the spiritual and social import of the Cause. Not only its message, but the historical fact of a new Revelation, with all its implications of a new and worldwide civilization, should be made clear. 

  Let the friends not hesitate to welcome to their observances, , even to those of a devotional character, the non-Bah~i'i public, many of whom may well be attracted d by the prayers and expressions of gratitude of the believers, no less than by the exalted tone of passages from Baha'i Writings.

         PROCLAMATION OF THE BAUA'L FAITH

 Baha'i Houses of Worship, often referred to as "silent teachers", are an effective means of proclaiming the Faith. Baroness Maria Von Trapp, whose life story inspired the musical play The Sound of Music, visited the House of Worship in Wilmette in April, 1966, and was greeted by Dr. David S. Ruhe, Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States (to the left of the photograph), and Mr. Salvatore A. Pelle, Director of Public Information for the Baha'is of the United Stales. 

  In September, 1966, the Baha'is of the Seychelles Islands sponsored a Baha'i Peace Day programme addressed by Mr. Edward Sanches, a Baha'i visitor from the Philippines. Others participating in the programme were Dr. Guy Lionnet, M.B.E., Director of Agriculture, and Archdeacon L T. Winterburn, M.A.

  The Baha'is of Hawaii sponsored an award-winning float in the Aloha Week Parade held on October 14, 1967. The theme Na Opio I Ke Ola 0 Ka Ama (The Youth is the Life of the Land) was spelled out in large floral letters along the side. It was estimated that 75 ,OOO people attended the parade, and that an additional 225,000 saw it on television. In addition, the Faith was mentioned in radio and television newscasts and in the local newspapers.

SIX INTERCONTINENTAL

                     CONFERENCES

                    OCTOBER 1967

  IN its message to the Baha'i world community at 

Ri4win 1965 the Universal 

 House of Justice made the felicific announcement:". 

 prepare national and local plans for the befitting celebration  of the centenary of Baha'u'llah's proclamation of His Message in September/Octo-ber 1867, to the kings and rulers of the world... The celebration of this fate-laden centenary period will open with a visit, in September1967, on the Feast of Ma±iyyat, by a few appointed representatives of the Baha'i world to the site of the house in Adrianople, where the historic Szfriy-i-Mulz4k was revealed. 

 Immediately following this joyful and pious act, six Intercontinental Conferences will be simultaneously held during the month of October in Panama City, Wilmette, Sydney, Kampala, Frankfurt and 

New Delhi."               

 On the follpwing pages are recorded the highlights of the historic events which occurred at these six Intercontinental Conferences, based on the report published in U.S. Baha'i News, No. 441, December 1967. 
                          
 MESSAGE FROM THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE TO THE
            INTERCONTINENTAL CONFERENCES

  Dearly-loved Friends, On this, the hundredth anniversary of the sounding in Adrianople of the opening notes of Baha'u'llah's proclamation to the rulers, leaders and peoples of the world, we recall with profound emotion the circumstances surrounding  the Faith of God at that time. 

 In a land, termed by Him, the "Land of Mystery", the Bearer of God's Revelation had arisen to carry that Faith a stage further in its divinely-ordained destiny. 

 Internally, the infant Cause of God was convulsed by a crisis from whose shadows emerged the majestic figure of Baha'u'llah, the visible Center and Head of a newly-established Faith. The first pilgrimages were made to His Residence, a further stage in the transfer of the remains of the 8Th was achieved, and above all the first intimations were given of the future station of 'Abdu'l-Baha as the Center of the Covenant and of the revelation of the new laws for the New Day. Externally, the full significance of the new Revelation was proclaimed by no one less than its Divine Bearer, His followers began openly to identify themselves with the Most Great Name, the independent character of the Faith became established and its fearless exponents took up their pens in defense of its fair name. 

 Now, a hundred years later, the friends gathered in the six Intercontinental Conferences  to commemorate the events of the past, privileged to gaze upon the portrait of their Beloved, must consider the urgent needs of the Cause today. As the Baha'i world enters the third phase of the Nine Year Plan we are called upon to proclaim once again that Divine Message to the leaders and masses of the world, to aid the Faith of God to emerge from obscurity  into the arena of public attention, to demonstrate through steadfast adherence to its laws the independent character of its mission and to brace ourselves in preparation for the attacks that are bound to be directed against its victorious onward march. Upon our efforts depends in very large measure the fate of humanity. The hundred years' respite having ended, the struggle between the forces of darkness  — man's lower nature — and the rising sun of the Divine Teachings which draw him on to his true station, intensifies day by day.

  The Centenary campaign has been opened by the 

Universal House of Justice 

 presenting to one hundred and forty Heads of State a compilation  of Baha'u'llah's 

Own proclamation. The      

 friends must now take the Message to the rest of humanity. The time is ripe and the opportunities illimitable. We are not alone nor helpless. Sustained by our love for each other and given power through the Administrative Order — so laboriously erected by our beloved Guardian — the Army of Light can achieve such victories as will astonish posterity. 

 We pray at the Holy Shrines that these Intercontinental Conferences will be centers of spiritual illumination inspiring the friends to redouble their efforts in further expanding and consolidating the Faith of God, to arise to fill the remaining pioneer goals, to undertake travelling teaching projects, and to offer generously of their substance to the various funds, particularly to the vital project of erecting  the Panama Temple, the foundation stone of which is being laid by 

Abdu'l-Baha Rfiljiyyih    

 Kh&num during the course of these Conferences. 

 As humanity enters the dark heart of this age of transition our course is clear — the achievement of the assigned goals and the proclamation of Baha'u'llah's healing Message. It is our ardent hope that from these Conferences valiant souls may arise with noble resolve and in loving service to ensure the successful and early accomplishment of the sacred tasks that lie ahead. 

  With loving Baha'i greetings,

SIX INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES     223

                   1. PANAMA CITY

  There was warmth and color everywhere, spreading itself like a gentle breeze in a garden of flowers. There was warmth in the laughter of greeting, in the dark, gentle eyes of Indians of many tribes — Guaymi, Kunas, Caribs, Guaji-ros, Mayas and others from faraway Peru, Bolivia and elsewhere — meeting each other for the first time since the great migrations of centuries ago that sent them on separate paths. Most of all there was warmth in the hearts, reflecting itself in the happy faces of Baha'is who came from all over Latin America and other parts of the world. There was thanksgiving too, for this was the first Intercontinental Conference ever to be held in Latin America and two hundred and thirty-nine Indian brothers and sisters in their beautiful, graceful dress were sharing in this historic event. There was a cornerstone of the Panama Temple to be laid in that land which 'Abdu'l-Baha had said would "unite the East and the West, tire North and the South"; and surely there was unity at this great festival that opened the Conference on Friday, October 6. 

 There were two Hands of the Cause of God, Abdu'l-Baha Rti1~yyih KMnum, representative of the Universal House of Justice, and JalAl 

KhAzeh of South America.   

 Beautiful gifts were presented to R6lflyyih KNnum at that opening festival — a colourful bead collar, a hat — there were Peruvian ponchos, jewelry and other items brought for the friends also, one of the many signs of the skill and artistry of the Indian people. 

 RiM2fyyih Kkinum was herself overcome by the joy and radiance that abounded among the six hundred and sixty believers assembled for the Conference. She said: "My heart is so full that I can hardly catch my breath... 

 When I saw the faces of all the Baha'is here as I came into this room I rejoiced. But when I saw the faces of the Indian Baha something a little different happened. 

 I wonder i~ in our human frailty and smallness, we realize the greatness and the implications of some of the Words of Baha'u'llah. We cling to His Words, we follow Him, we love Him, we want to serve Him hut we forget that each one of His phrases is the 

Word of God Himself.       

 And when I looked at the Indian Baha'is here tonight I remembered the Words of 'Abdu'l-Baha which, although they are not quite the same as the Words of Baha'u'llah are, nevertheless, an animating influence in the Cause of God for all time. He said that if the indigenous peoples of the Americas would accept this Revelation they would have an effect on the world equal to that which had been produced when the Arabians had accepted the Prophet 

Mubammad.                  

 "In our present world we forget the influences of the past. We are lost in the 20th century and we forget our history; but when the people of the Arabian Peninsula accepted the Manifestation of God, Mubammad, they produced an influence in the world that went deep into China in the East and that brought about the Renaissance in Europe. It would perhaps not be too great an exaggeration to say that one of the waves released by the Renaissance was the colonization by Europeans of the Americas. These are all a part of history. 

 So we may well ask ourselves what will be the repercussions from the Indian Baha'is who accept Baha'u'llah  in the Western Hemisphere? 

 According to the Words of the Son of Baha'u'llah, they will release an impetus that will travel all over the world because that is the implication of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Words. 

 When I heard that tonight a great many more Indian Baha'is were present than had been anticipated I rejoiced and I hope that our Indian brothers and sisters who are here tonight and who will be here throughout this Intercontinental Conference whether they happen to be from Panama or from other countries of Latin America, will carry back to their own people, whether they are Baha'is or not, the spirit of this Conference and the spirit of Baha'u'llah's 

Message.                   

 "We make a great mistake in this world when we think that unity in the concept of Baha'u'llah means uniformity. When you analyze it, the people of the world today, whatever political  bloc they belong to, whatever party they adhere to, whatever religion they follow, they think the best thing would be if everybody was like themselves; but this is not the Message of Baha'u'llah. 
God created us different.  

 This is our honor, this is our blessing, this is our distinction.  It means that each group of the human race has developed its own capacities. 
It has its


<p224>
224                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 own gift to bring to the family of human beings. "So I ask particularly the Indian Baha'is to remember this and to be immensely proud of their past and immensely proud of being Indians. They remember as I am sure I remember  that it was the white people who did a great deal to destroy their history. They made them feel that the history of the white man was greater than the history of the red man. But this is not the Message of Baha'u'llah. 

The Message of Baha'u'llah 

 is that they have a great future and they have great capacity. 

 "I want them to know that their Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, rejoiced when the news reached him of every single Indian Baha'i. 

 He could not wait to speak about it. lie would tell it to all those who served at the World Center, he would tell it to the pilgrims, and then he would cable it to the BTh&i world. 

 This was a very sincere act on his part, it came from the depths of his heart. The Baha world, which after all is a world of its own which exists all over the planet now, is waiting for more Indian Baha to enter the Cause of Baha'u'llah. They want them to teach their own people more; they want them to increase by the thousands. 

 Who knows, when we have enough Indian Baha'is in the Western Hemisphere under the shadow of Baha'u'llah, perhaps they will be the ones to carry the spirit of Baha'u'llah to the white population of this 

Hemisphere!                

 "You Indian friends arc like a great tree that has its roots in the soil of all the Americas. To the degree to which your people accept Baha'u'llah,  you will bear your fruit. 

 It will be good fruit and when the white man eats it he will be a better white man." 

 The formal opening of the Conference was on Saturday morning. In the afternoon the Hand of the Cause Ja1~1 Khizeh addressed the representatives of twenty-three American 

National Assemblies, Auxiliary

 Board members, and all the believers on the "Praise and Glory of Baha'u'llah", again emphasizing the special privileges of this particular Conference. Ri~jiyyih KhThum spoke again in the evening on the banishment and imprisonment of Baha'u'llah and of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi. This was followed by a showing of Carmel, the Mountain of God, the film sent by the Universal House of Justice, and also the Columbia Broadcasting System television program, 

And His Name Shall Be      
One.                       

 Sunday morning came and the moment of dedication had arrived. Would it rain? It was the rainy season. But the sun shone bright and hot as the seven buses, many private cars and taxis arrived at the foot of the hill and the path leading to the Temple site. The believers walked about two hundred and fifty yards to the place where the Temple is to be built in an area called Cerro Sonsonate. Spanish, French, English, Arabic and Guaymi — these were the languages of prayer. Peter Tillotson, the young English architect of the future House of Worship,  not a Baha'i, pledged his best. Dr. Tejada Morn, attorney for the Panama National Assembly, and Raul Mango, engineer and original owner of the land, also spoke. 

 RiMdyyih KhAnum, after laying the cornerstone, a native stone found not far from the site, and placing within it the sacred dust and roses brought by her from the tomb of Baha'u'llah, observed that Shoghi Effendi himself had stated that the first place in Central America to have a House of Worship would be Panama. The Temple, she emphasized, was for all peoples, not for the Baha alone. 

 The afternoon brought the most moving event of the Conference, the viewing of the portrait of Baha'u'llah. 

 It rested on gold fabric brought from Irgn, placed aver a red silk cloth. Just before the viewing, Rfi~iyyih KhAnum placed red and white roses beside the picture. Then the friends slowly came forward. There was a blind Indian friend who stood before the photograph he could not see with his physical eyes. Rtxl3iyyih Kh4num guided his fingers over the frame so that he might experience the richness  of this moment and see with his inner vision. 

 This day, so full and profound, was concluded  with a public meeting where at least one hundred and fifty guests joined the Baha to fill the hail and to hear Oscar 

Sierra I, National Assembly

 member from Guatemala, speak on the meaning of Baha'u'llah's coming and His Message for humanity. 
    On Monday, October 9, Hooper

Dunbar, Auxiliary Board    

 member, led a discussion on literature and mentioned the need to translate into the native languages for many of the poorer peoples. 

 It is important, he said, that the translations reflect the Teachings uniformly. Copies of all materials to be translated for any part of Latin America should be sent through the

  Friends assembled at Cerro Sonsonate for the laying of the cornerstone of the Mother Temple of Latin America. 

  respective National Spiritual Assemblies to the Baha'i 

Publishing Trust in Argentina.

 The Spanish translation of The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah was announced. The Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Rfi~dyyih KMnum said that the Words of Baha'u'llah are different from any other words; they are food for the soul of man and when people eat of these Words their souls grow. In translating for the Indian peoples we should always give them some of this precious food. 

     Eduardo Perez de Leon      

 of Mexico opened an afternoon consultation on publicity, asking that publicity on the Conference be utilized in all countries, as specified by the Universal House of Justice. Auxiliary 

Board member Artemus Lamb  

 of Mexico concentrated attention  on radio, since television is available oniy in large cities and on a limited scale. Even the poor people generally have access to radios. 

 It is important to develop good relations with radio stations, he said, and to try to acquire free radio time for public service. Sometimes this can be accomplished through arranging interviews with a visiting Baha'i and through current Baha events of public interest. 
Fred Berest of the National

Spiritual Assembly of Panama

 mentioned a radio program of five minutes a day, five days a week, which costs only fifteen dollars per month, after which the tapes are given to small village stations. 

 A strong appeal for pioneer teachers to go into the mountain areas was made by Rose Mangopis of Nicaragua. 

 "Let us get moving," she said, "and go into the mountains to teach Baha'u'llah's laws." 

     Margot Worley, Auxiliary   

 Board member from Brazil, quoted from the Guardian's writings on the Fund. No individual, she said, was functioning fully in the World Order of Baha'u'llah unless he supports the Fund, no matter how modestly. The Hand of the Cause JalAl KhAzeh spoke of the need for the new, infant national communities to gradually grow


<p226>
226              THE BAHA'I WORLD
  The Hands of the Cause and friends attending the Panama Conference.

  into maturity and to become completely self-supporting. 

     Ra~iyyih KiPnum said: "It  

 seems to me that we should remember that just the way it does not matter what we eat, every human being eats with his mouth; the same thing is true of everything  else we do in this world. Sometimes people say, 'Well, we had to give to the church in the past, or, we belonged to some society and they were forever asking for funds and now that we are Baha'is we do not want any more of that.' They say, 'That was the past and we are the future.' 

 But the fact remains that all of us —  families, communities, tribes, municipalities, nations — we all have to live by means. 

 The whole Baha system has to go forward also through making certain expenditures because we live in a material world and have to live with material means. 

 "We have no choice, so that it seems to me that everybody can grasp this point and certainly  our Indian friends can grasp it with the same understanding that we do because they are men and we are men and it is understandable  to everybody. The most precious thing has already been emphasized here — that everybody should give. This is because this one peso or one penny or one centavo or whatever your smallest denomination here is, that you give to your Faith makes the work go along. Personally, I do not think anything in the world has the value of the contributions of the poor. No matter how much a rich man gives, he never succeeds really in giving because he is like a spring, he is fortunate enough to always have something coming out of the bottom of the well, he never really sacrifices. 

 "There is a tribe in Africa that lives in the desert and has so little water that they have to catch the dew, drop by drop, and one sip of that means the difference between life and death, so we see how preCious this is. This is like a poor man's money. I think that we should sometimes remember that people who live in primitive societies are making the transition from a society that lives on barter and exchange of goods to our way of money. They have very little money but still they can give that one penny and it is their blessing to do so." It was announced that over eighty thousand

  dollars had been contributed toward the building  of the Temple by National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 and individuals, and many contributions were received during the Conference. 

Architect Peter Tillotson  

 designated two years as building time, once the preliminaries are completed. The secretary of the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Panama, Leota  

 Lockman, gave tribute to Baha'i consulting architect, Robert Mctaugh-liii,  of the U.S.A., and to Paul Thick of Hawaii who supervised the building of the road. 

 The Kuna Indian tribe of Panama donated $93.21 to the Temple Fund and an equal amount to their 

National Assembly Fund     

 from the sale of molas, large pieces of beautifully designed fabric. 

 A banquet at the Hilton Hotel, to present the Hand of the Cause Amatu'I-BahA Ral2iyyih KhAnum, entertained many dignitaries of Panama, various foreign embassies and members  of the press. 

 Another banquet was held at the Lions' Club Camp on the outskirts of the city. It was ajoyous, festive evening. There were colorful decorations, beautiful costumes, an excellent meal, dances and songs by many tribal groups. 

 The publicity generated by the Conference was extensive. There were thirtyfive press stories and photographs used in local papers, two features appearing on the Saturday after the close of the Conference; a five-minute television coverage of the dignitaries' banquet; two television interviews; five television news stories; five radio news stories; a ten-minute radio interview of four personalities at the Conference; a United Press International press interview sent throughout Latin America; and a press interview by the Copley newspapers to be distributed during 

Abdu'l-Baha Rfl1~yyih KhAnum's

 scheduled tour of Latin American countries. 

 A number of people became Baha'is as a direct effect of the Conference, many of whom were moved by the spirit of the Indian believers

                 2. CHICAGO/WILMETTE

  From every corner of the continent, drawn as by a magnet to its spiritual heart, the travellers came, three thousand in number. 

 Some were on the way since early dawn; many had travelled all through the night. They turned into the quiet streets near the shore of Lake Michigan, moving through the pale windy sunlight, under the high thin clouds and olive-toned leaves of early autumn, and past the splash of the fountains in their fluttery circles of late-blooming petunias. 

 Quietly they gathered, all the flowers of His garden together, the rich clark ones and the delicate oriental ones, accenting the rank and file of the occident. 

 They assembled in happy expectancy to share, as the fitting begin-fling of the momentous Conference, the service of commemoration in the holiest House of Worship in the Baha'i world. 

 The service began with the ringing voice of the Hand of the Cause Ta6zu'l1&h Samandari chanting in Persian the Words of Him to Whose voice he had once listened as a youth. Then in the English tongue came Words from 

Baha'u'llah's  Writings:   

 "Magnified be Thy Name, 0 my God, for that Thou hast man jfested the Day which is the King of Days.. 

 And again: "Many a chilled heart, 0 my God, bath been set ablaze with the Fire of Thy ....... How many are the strangers . how numerous the thirsty ones. 

 And yet again: "Release yourselves, 0 nightingales of God, from the thorns and brambles  of wretchedness and misery now is the time to gaze upon His beauty.. 
to hearken to His voice..  

 Young voices welled into the dome of the Temple of Light. All turned toward the Holy Land as the Hand of the Cause of God John Robarts recited the beautiful Tablet of Visitation:  ..... 

 the glory which bath slioneforthfrorn Thy most effulgent Beauty rest upon Thee, 0 Thou Who art the Man jfestation of Grandeur... through Thee the  Beauty of the Unseen bath shone forth above the horizon of creation.. 

 In the hush that followed Mr. Samandari, clasping to his breast with both arms the portrait  of Him Who is known as the Glory of God, walked to the table and placed the portrait beside a bouquet of deep red roses. 

 Row by row and one by one every person in the 

Temple                     
filed past that table.     

 Each had his precious moment to gaze at the photograph of Baha'u'llah.  Thus, with hearts lifted and illuminated by prayer, and refreshed by the unique privilege of viewing the likeness of the Beloved, the friends began the historic days of the 

Conference.                

 The Grand Ballroom of the Palmer House in Chicago was full at the opening of the meeting on Thursday evening for commemoration of the momentous events in Adrianople one hundred years ago. On the platform were seated the three Hands of the Cause and members of their Auxiliary 

Boards in North America.   

 Auxiliary Board member Velma Sherrill introduced the Hands of the Cause: Ta6zu'llAh Samandari, representative of the Universal House of Justice at this historic 

Conference; Dhikru'llAh Kh~dem

 who had been sent to the United States by the beloved Guardian; and John Robarts, recently returned to Canada from Africa. 

 After the singing of one of Baha'u'llah's poems by Mrs. ZhAlih Ktaidem, accompanied on the violin by Dr. Parviz Movagh, Mr. Kh~dem spoke of the great privilege the. 

 believers  of today have in being able to deliver to all the world the Message of Baha'u'llah rejected by the rulers of the earth one hundred years ago. He introduced Mr. Samandari, a member of one of the oldest families in the Faith, who (Mrs. Marzieh Gail interpreting) gave loving greetings from the Universal House of Justice. This is a precious Faith, he pointed out, a Faith the Like of which appears not once in one thousand years, but once in five hundred thousand years; a Faith which came to the whole world, not just to one people. 

 The message from the Universal House of Justice to the Conference was read by Mr. Robarts after which Mr. Samandari continued with an admonition which had been emphasized by 'Abdu'l-Baha, by Shoghi Effendi, and by the Universal House of Justice: you must know the value of these days. He spoke of the sacrifices made by the 

Exalted Mb and His Letters 

 of the Living, and by Baha'u'llah for almost fifty years. He quoted Shoghi Effendi as saying that all the peoples of the world must pass through three stages: they must suffer for what their hands have wrought; they will awaken after a

  punishment which will burn away the drunken fumes from their brains; and then they will come into the Cause of Godin troops. 

 He spoke of the importance of teaching ("begin tonight" Mr. KhAdcm interpolated), and urged each one to deepen in his understanding of the Faith by concentrating on the Holy Tablets, and to remain firm and united. 

 In closing he told the moving account of being in the presence of Baha'u'llah just seven days before His passing. As the Blessed Beauty lay in His bed, He spoke of the importance of preventing disunity and unhappiness among the Baha, of investigating the motives of people, and of being alert. It will take strength to meet the great upheavals which the Guardian has said were certain to take place; first in the Holy Land; second in Persia; and third in America. The friends must be steadfast and detached, they must be the Teachings, and must immediately  obey the commands of the Universal House of Justice. 

 Throughout the day and evening of Friday, the Conference continued in the ballroom of the Palmer House, under the glittering, many-tiered crystal chandeliers of the room's sump tuous d6cor. The theme on this day was "World-Wide 

Proclamation — A New Dimension". 

 From the opening morning prayers, raised in concert with the beautiful musical supplication of A lid h-u-A Hid by the California Victory Chorus, to the climactic afternoon's reading of President Lyndon B. Johnson's letter of greeting to the Conference sent through the delegation of the National Spiritual Assembly  of the United States, the day was one of a rising spiritual dan. There were loving cabled greetings from around the world. A thrilling roll-call of nations brought to their feet representatives of the far-flung sovereignty of the Greatest Name as well as those Knights of Baha'u'llah who carried His banner to distant outposts. 

 The Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llfih KhAdem gave an overwhelming account from Nabil's unpublished narrative telling of Baha'u'llah's last night in Constantinople when, in reference to the royal Ottoman farmAn banishing Him still further, to the "land of mystery", He vowed that with the twelve followers then with Him He would "overthrow their dynasty and establish the Kingdom of God on earth". 
That night every

 one could see the great power emanating from Baha'u'llah. 

 Then in a poignant tribute of remembrance, Mr. Khadem chanted two verses from the Tablet of Nawruz revealed on that night, a group of Persian friends chanting the response as the original faithful twelve had done. 

 "Look what happened through twelve that night, and now with one hundred thousand think what will happen to the world!" 
exclaimed  the beloved   

Hand.                     
    Glenford Mitchell, Chairman

 of the National Teaching Committee, followed with a stirring appeal for each individual to recall the "con-tract"  into which he entered when he declared his acceptance of the Faith, and emphasized such potent phrases from the message of the Universal House of Justice as "the time is ripe"; "the hundred years respite having ended"; "as humanity enters the dark heart of this age of transition". He discussed the burgeoning population  with its growing preponderance of youth and pointed out the special opportunities for Baha'i youth to teach, remembering as their models the illustrious first believers who were all under thirty years of age. The responsibility of the entire Baha community at this time is to take the Message to the"hyways and back alleys of the world", he said. 

   Speaking for Alaska, Robert

 Moul, member of the National Spiritual Assembly, gave a detailed r~sum~ of their proclamation plans, the highlights of which include: preparation of special pamphlets for direct mailing to villages unreached by the usual communication media; preparation for mass mailing in two Indian languages of A Message w tire Native Peoples of Alaska; presentation to one hundred and thirty Alaskan personages of the book, 

The Proclamation  of Baha'u'llah;

 posters, spot radio announcements and a television show. 

   Canadian National Spiritual

 Assembly member,  Dr. Suhell Bushru'i, presented a broad picture of that country's spiritual heritage and gave details of their plan for six annual phases of proclamation, each directed toward a particular  segment of the population. Delegations are being sent to thirty-four religious organizations to present The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah and on October 15 a copy of this book is being presented to the Prime Minister. 

 Ten thousand clergymen are receiving a series of four letters from the Canadian Baha'i community, these letters to be dispatched at eight-week intervals. Proclamation material will be sent to Indian Chiefs of Councils and Reservations and there will be a special emphasis on the Baha'i teachings  on social justice in the hope that eventually the majority of the Canadian Baha'i membership  will be Indians. 

 Highlights of the American proclamation plan, given by the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly, Dr. David Ruhe, include: presentation to President 

Lyndon B. Johnson of The  
Proclamation of Baha'u'llah;

 mailing to ten thousand national leaders the booklet Baha'u'llah: His Call to the Nations; fully capitalizing on the United Nations' 1968 Human Rights Year beginning with the issuing of a statement on human rights during this Conference; publicity on the Mark Tobey exhibit at the Roosevelt University, Chicago, during October; and the six-continent radiotelephone  hookup at the Conference. 

 The crowning moment of the day was the reading of the letter from President Johnson to the Conference. 

 It said, in part: "I am pleased •to acknowledge the growing good you do. Yours has been a work of love. 

 You have sown seeds of righteousness and justice, and humanity  will reap rich harvests from your toil. Your purpose is the purpose of America, your hope the hope of men of goodwill everywhere... 

 All thoughtful and farsighted men respect the mission of your faith. For every one of us looks forward to that day when the earth will truly be one country — and mankind its citizens." 

 That evening at the public meeting in the ballroom an overflow crowd numbering well above three thousand, including many guests, heard Bishop James A. Pike, wellknown Episcopalian clergyman, and Dr. Firuz Kazem-zadeh,  former chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly, speak respectively on "Qualm and Quest" and 

"Baha'u'llah: His Call    
to the Nations".          

 Bishop Pike instantly commanded attention with an opening series of humorous remarks about the world political scene and a gracious acknowledgement that "We're very fortunate there is in the world. an inclusive 

Faith.                    

 After exploring current trends of religious interest among the avant-garde youth who are "seeking a shortcut to mystical experience", Bishop Pike's summation included an admonition  to the Baha to emulate Baha'u'llah, 

Who                       
R


<p232>
232                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 promoted truths unpopular in His time and even endorsed the religion whose adherents persecuted Him. "Carry on. Say it loud and clear", were his parting words. 

 Dr. Kazenizadeh, historian, scholar and writer, prefaced his delivery of the Message of Baha'u'llah with a comment on the historical significance of His call to the nations as constituting  a turning point in world history. 

 He called ~pecia1 attention to Baha'u'llah's counsels of justice and peace and His plea to world rulers to reduce armaments and use the money to relieve the plight of the poor. 

 The summation of the talk affirmed Baha'i belief in the inevitability of a new World Order and brought a standing ovation from the audience. 

 On Saturday the scene of the Conference was the Continental Room of the 

Conrad Hilton Hotel. Here  

 as in the previous sessions the spirit rose from climax to climax until one was sure it could rise no higher, only to be thrilled by the next great climax. 

 The Hand of the Cause John Robarts spoke movingly of the Tab Jets of the Divine Plan which are instructions from God Himself. In them the North American Baha'is are given the responsibility of taking the Eaith to all parts of the world. 

 The prayers which are in these Tablets should be used by the friends daily. Had this been done fifty years ago there might have been masses of believers today. A power has been infused into the world by the 

Universal House of Justice 

 by which the Faith will advance on the unknown seas of proclamation, but the results depend ultimately on the efforts of the individual Baha. 

 As Mr. Robarts finished speaking it was announced that the telephone hookup with the other Intercontinental Conferences was ready. For the first time in history a conference call was made connecting six continents simultaneously.  What a thrill it was to hear Dr. Daniel Jordan speak words of greeting and then to hear similar greetings from each of the five other continents. Over three hundred and fifty Baha'is and six National Spiritual 

Assemblies of Australasia  

 were gathered in Sydney for this great event. 

 In Frankfurt there were one thousand  six hundred believers. More than seven hundred Baha'is gathered in Panama were thrilled about the laying of the cornerstone of a new Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 From New Delhi came the greetings from three thousand Baha of Asia. The Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga spoke on behalf of the Baha'is gathered in Kampala. 

 The telephone company's communications engineer was almost as excited as the Baha'is. This moment was a forceful reminder of the first telegraphic message, "What hath God wrought?" 

 on the night of the Declaration of the Bib, and was a fitting event for the centenary  of Baha'u'llah's proclamation. Many present thought of the Hand of the Cause Dhikru'lIgh Khddem's favourite quotation, "0 Lord, in crease my astonishment in Thee!" 

 The morning session ended with a beautifully narrated slide program, prepared and presented by the Centenary Committee, showing highlights of the role played by North American DaMNs in the spread of the Faith. 

 The story of early American believers, skillfully woven together into an inspiring presentation of past victories was a challenge to go on without faltering to win the victories assigned by the Universal House of Justice today. 

 In the afternoon the three ly4ational Assemblies gave illuminating reports of the Nine Year Plan goals of their countries, the progress made to date, and their needs to win those remaining. Mrs. Beverly Koistoc drew a striking picture of the vast, varied country of Alaska. Michael Rochester outlined clearly the assets of the Canadian Baha'is as well as their problems of geographical barriers and ethnic diversity. 

 Dr. Dwight Mien presented the U.S. picture with attractive and informative charts of progress and needs. 

 In all three countries the administrative  goals such as legal recognition, incorporation  of local assemblies, and translating and publishing of literature seem to be well in hand. For the goals of opening new localities, forming new Assemblies, and meeting foreign pioneering  commitments, however, Baha'is who are willing to arise and move to serve Baha'u'llah are needed in all three countries. 

 Indian teaching,  as well as teaching all minority groups, is emphasized in all three countries, and examples of successes in one place are valuable as guidance  for others. 

 After a beautiful musical interlude by a Baha'i choral group, the afternoon program was presented by the Hands of the Cause. 

 A Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed to the father of the Hand of the Cause TarAzu'lhh Saman-dad, read both in English and Persian, stated

  that He was waiting for the souls who would work ceaselessly day and night for the Cause. Auxiliary 

Board member Florence      

 Mayberry in introducing the Hands referred to the National Spiritual Assemblies as generals, the kind who go into the thick of battle with the troops, and characterized the Hands of the Cause as Standard Bearers who go out ahead, but who want their followers to catch up with them and who are continually calling them to come ahead. 

 The Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llAh KhAdem spoke of the rich heritage of the North American Baha'is as spiritual descendants of the Dawn-Breakers, and reminded them that the Universal House of Justice would not have given them the tasks if it were not possible for these valiant believers to meet them. 

 The Hand of the Cause TarAzu'llAh Saman-dan, with Mrs. Marzieh Gail as interpreter, referred to the telephone communication, quoting a poet who wrote, "This is only the tracing of the dawn; wait until you see what the morning brings." He called for sacrificial services on the part of all believers, recalling the ceaseless labors of the beloved Guardian and reminding the believers that today the Universal  House of Justice waits anxiously for the Baha'is, particularly the young believers, to arise to serve the 

Faith.                     

 At seven in the evening of Saturday, October 7, the foyer outside the Continental Room of the Hilton Hotel was the scene of a happy milling crowd awaiting the small miracle achieved by the caterers who were able to metamorphose the huge assembly room of the Conference sessions into a festive, candlelit banquet hail. 

 No one seemed to need the reminder, but Master of Ceremonies Arthur Dahi called attention to the fact that this banquet was the opportunity for Baha'is to pause in their work and enjoy each other's company — that life is to be enjoyed and everyone  should be happy and can be so, when he knows that in spite of the grimness of the times there are counterforces working right now to


<p235>
SIX INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES     235
build a wonderful world.   

 And so, this night, the )Baha'is did enjoy art, music, poetry and humor. 

 The magnificent voice of young Thomas Paul, bass, who has appeared with all the major American symphonies, winning significant awards, gave a thrilling recital of songs including  two of the lovely scriptural verses set to music by 

Charles Wolcott, Blessed   

 is the Spot and 0 Thou by Whose Name. 

 Edwin C. Berry, Executive Director of the Chicago Urban League — who has written extensively  on, and is considered one of the outstanding  creative thinkers in, the field of race relations, who has spent years in social work, taught in nine universities, and has been named Chicagoan of the year — spoke on "The Current Dilemma". He reminded the audience that he does not condone violence but he does understand it. Referring to the fetish of "law and order", he wisely indicated that it should read "law and justice", and that an impossible burden  has been placed on police who must keep order in an unjust society. He pointed out the vast difference between suppressing riots and eliminating their cause. Hitler, too, he said, had a society with order, but no justice. In conclusion he spoke for his people, that "We do not seek more (than everyone's right to be the person he was meant to be).. but we will settle for no less!" 

 The Baha'i answer to Mr. Berry's appeal had already been prepared for distribution on Sunday morning, but that statement by the National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 of North America  was so right and timely an answer that it was read then and there — the statement, 

"Human Rights are God-Given
Rights".                   

 Robert Hayden, one of the faculty of Fisk University, an award-winning poet and Poetry Editor of World Order magazine, gave the first public reading of the beautiful verses he had composed especially for this Intercontinental Conference, 

And All the Atoms Cry      
Aloud.                     
     Mrs. Mildred Mottahedeli   

 spoke of "The Coming Century", yet another reminder that "Now," indeed, "is the time for very great things," even in the contingent world. "For a hundred years now, Baha'u'llah has unrolled for sensitive hearts. His mighty Message —  ushering in the day of justice and world unity — A selection of the paintings of Mark Tobey from the collection of Mr. Arthur Dahi was displayed as part of the centennial observance.


<p236>
236                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Baha'is have barely understood the implications  of His words, when He referred to 'advancing  civilization'." 

 She reminded the audience that Baha'u'llah spoke of unreligious things like free commerce between countries... He spoke of the dignity of labor... 

 She pointed out that the Baha concept  of world language is not simply the bare business of one utilitarian international language,  but the whole concept of intercommunication of ideas. There is room in this brave, new world only for unity, never for prejudice. World government is the oniy logical conclusion of this burgeoning new civilization. "A new race will inhabit the earth," she said, "linked in love — rising at last after the years of struggle to the brink of maturity. The Great Wind of God is changing the earth — the world of the future will look upon the past century as a century of travail that gave birth to a beautiful civilization." 

 Following the banquet, a music festival taking as its theme, "Sounds of a New World", featured a number of highly talented young Baha'is and the 

Southern California Baha'i Chorus.

 The enthusiastic performers began with a monologue to musical accompaniment. 

 The musical monologue was followed with selections by the Chorus and various popular young singers. 

 And thus with music in the modern vein did the evening of joy and relaxation come to a happy conclusion. 

 The last session, held Sunday morning was, like the first, given over to the Hands of the Cause of God and rose to great heights of power and dedication. 

 Mr. John Robarts made a heartfelt appeal for more fervent use of prayer, begging those in the audience to say the Greatest Name for him while he was speaking. 

 He told stories of how the power of intense concentration in prayer to remove personal difficulties had changed the course of the Faith in Canada to miraculous success in teaching. Dedication and love are not enough. 

 Pray, he said, and God will send the hungry, waiting people to you. 

 Mr. Samandari spoke (with his son Dr. Samandari interpreting) on the necessity for prayer. 

 He told of being in the presence of Baha'u'llah with two or three others when he was sixteen years old. As they were leaving, Baha'u'llah said to them, "Pray for 

Us. Pray                   

 for Us." Prayer is not just saying or reading the words; it is heartfelt feeling. 

 He quoted from Baha'u'llah to show the greatness of this day, spoke of the enormous quantity of His Writings, and then brought home the responsibility to each of us. The result of these Conferences will be, he said, that each will gain from them whatever he should. Each must make a new covenant with Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi, and the 

Universal  House of Justice

 that he will bring one soul to the Faith. 

 He spoke at some length about detachment from material goods, warning that wealth is ephemeral. 

 Whatever is given to the treasury of Baha'u'llah will be protected and will remain when all else is swept away. The needs for the Faith in the Holy Land are enormous, the duties of the Universal House of Justice are great and are expensive, but the world will be changed by their activities. 

 lie told of the pilgrimage to Adrianopie of the six Hands of the Cause delegated by the Universal House of Justice to represent them at the Conferences. 

 Before they left Haifa they gathered at the Hoiy Shrines, praying for the Baha'is throughout the world. The six delegates flew to Istanbul, where they stayed one night before going on to Adrianople, accompanied by the National Spiritual Assembly of Turkey and two Auxiliary Board members. In Adrianople the six Hands of the Cause, alone in the House of Baha'u'llah, read together the Sariy-i-Mulak. On the following day the other believers (members of the National Assembly of Turkey, of the Local 

Assembly of Adrianople     

 and two Auxiliary Board members) were present and a reception was held in the home of one of the believers. The House of Baha'u'llah, he said, is very beautiful and is exactly as it was in His time. It has been a silent teacher in all Turkey. The holy places in Adrianople are owned by the Baha'is, are looked after by the Assemblies and are in excellent condition. 

 At the end of Mr. Samandari's talk a prayer was movingly recited with the pure simplicity of childhood, by a little girl — his great granddaughter. 

 After a summary of the Conference ably presented by Dr. Peter Khan, Auxiliary Board member, the audience was permitted to see, in a beautifully arranged slide program, the House of Baha'u'llah in Adrianople, the places sancti

  fled by His presence in 'Akka, and all the Holy Shrines and gardens at the World 

Center.                    

 The great surge of the spirit, which had risen steadily throughout the Conference, now reached its peak, a spirit expressed not in noisy emotionalism, but in deep and quiet dedication. The points Peter Khan had brought out in his review of the Conference brought home to all the realization that they stand on the threshold of years without precedence, that much of the fuwre welfare of mankind rests in their hands, and that on leaving the Conference they face a world of turbulence in which only the Baha'is can proclaim the healing Message of Baha'u'llah, that the Promised Onehas come. 

 It was in that spirit that the friends listened and silently participated in the message from this Conference to the Universal House of Justice, read by Mrs. Janet Smith of the National  Spiritual 

Assembly of Alaska. It     

 was in that spirit that two hundred and sixteen believers rose, quietly, deeply moved, but without fanfare  to answer the call of the Hands of the Cause for pioneers. 

 The friends left the Conference with a deep sense of gratitude to all those who, working unobtrusively,  had made this meeting possible; to the Hands of the Cause of God, who had stirred them out of their lethargy and deepened their awareness; and above all to the 

Universal House of Justice 

 for its guidance of the friends in six Conferences throughout the world, friends linked together by an indissoluble bond. 

 Only when it was over did one realize that all the events of the North American Conference had been arranged to bring us closer to Baha'u'llah. 

 We had looked upon His face as recorded by an actual photograph; had seen and heard one who had looked upon His living face and heard His voice, and had been shown the places where He had walked. 

 The Universal House of Justice, that supreme, infallible vehicle of divine guidance today, had focused the light on Baha'u'llah alone. 

 Seeking no glory for themselves, they had taken loving care to enable each one to "gaze on" His "beauty and observe whatsoever is in" His "book".

                3.  SYDNEY

     Proclamation in Australasia

 was sounded on an auspicious and joyous opening note. 

The Lord Mayor of Sydney  

 gave a civic reception in honor of the Hand of the Cause of God Dr. Ugo Giachery and seventy Baha'is representing all areas of the Pacific and the Australian continent. 

 This event, held at noon, Thursday, October 5, generated an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program presented on the opening night of the Conference, giving an extra stimulus to the extensive newspaper coverage. 

 The Lord Mayor was deeply impressed  by the wide representation of visitors coming from such a far-flung area and by the tenor of the Baha'i principles, and gave a warm welcome to the assemblage. 

 The Conference itself opened with the introduction of the Hand of the Cause of God Dr. Ugo Giachery, representative of the Universal House of Justice, as well as Collis Featherstone, the Hand of the Cause of 

God from Australia. Jeff  

 Rodwell, chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly, greeted the nine Auxiliary Board members, the members of National Spiritual Assemblies and other believers from Australia, 

New Zealand, Western      

 and American  Samoa, French Polynesia, British Solomon Islands, 

Fiji, Gilbert and Ellice  

 Islands, Guam, Hawaii, IrAn, Mariana Islands, 

New Hebrides, Portuguese  
Timor, Territory of Papua 

 and New Guinea, Tonga, Cook Islands, New Caledonia, the Philippines, the United States of America, 

Canada and Great Britain. 

 Could anything but the love of Baha'u'llah bring together so many people from such distant and disparate areas in such joy and unity? There were over thee hundred and fifty of them from twenty-one countries and islands, a true expression of the uniting power of the Faith. Later that evening the friends were shown the film, And His Name Shall Be One, from the 

Columbia Broadcasting     
System television program,

A Lamp Unto My Feet.      

 On the morning of Friday, October 6, Dr. Giachery presented the message of the Universal  House of Justice and spoke of thevisit of the six Hands to the holy places associated with the exile of Baha'u'llah to Constantinople and Adrianople. He expressed the hope that he might convey some of the emotions experienced on this journey, the first official pilgrimage to these places. He explained that with every step ofthejourneyfromlstanbul to Adrianople they contemplated the sufferings of Baha'u'llah, Who had made the same journey one hundred years before. 

 He mentioned the prayers of the Hands in the house of RiKIA Big, which has been restored to its original condition, and the Feast of MaThiyyat with readings from the Sariy-i-Mulak. 

 Mrs. Viva Rodwell reviewed the events which transpired in Adrianople, culminating in Baha'u'llah's revelation of the Sariy-i-Mulak. As background she gave an outline of European history and of the oppressed conditions of the masses, pointing out the relevancy of Baha'u'llah's  Message to the leaders of the world. This review was followed with the reading of the Sariy-i-MultW and other Tablets of Baha'u'llah to the rulers, interspersed with appropriate musical selections. 

 John Davidson gave a presentation of the history and scope of Baha'u'llah's proclamation, not only conveying the historical facts, but also the deep suffering of Baha'u'llah because of Mirza Yatiy~'s transgression and the subsequent  oppression of SultAn 'Abdu'1-'Aziz. 

 In outlining the scope of ]lahA'u'lIAh's proclamation he summarized the major themes of the Divine Summons of Baha'u'llah. Auxiliary Board member Miss Thelma Perks spoke on the monarchs and religious leaders and institutions  who were the recipients of the Message of Baha'u'llah. 

 William Washington continued with the account of the effect of Baha'u'llah's Teachings on the world, and Niualeava Tuataga terminated this session with a spirited and inspiring  talk on the Faith. 

 On Friday night a special commemorative Temple service was held at which a youth choir sang selections of Baha'u'llah's Words. 

 After the service the assembled believers viewed the portrait of Baha'u'llah brought from the Holy Land for this occasion. The atmosphere in the Temple was intense as each believer approached and gazed on the face of Baha'u'llah, recalling the words of Professor E. G. Browne, "The face of Him on Whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it.

  tralia, through its representative, Mr. P. de Vogel, announced its plans to present the book, The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, to the Gover-nor-General,  the Prime Minister, political leaders, religious dignitaries and people of eminence throughout Australia. 

 These activities  are to be accompanied by an intensive proclamation to all sections of the community. The representative of the National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand, Mrs. Ereda Butler, mentioned that a special proclamation conference  in Auckland was held prior to the Intercontinental Conference, which resulted in a plan being launched to culminate with a public meeting on November 12, the birthday of Baha'u'llah. 

 Their plan included the presentation  of one hundred and fifty books to leaders and a special weekend festival on October 19 — 20. 

 Mrs. Lillian 'A1A'i of the National Spiritual Assembly of the South Pacific Ocean stated that with the distances involved in the South Pacific the difficulties of proclamation were evident. Two special copies of The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah are to be presented to the King of Tonga and the King of Samoa. 

     The National Spirjtual     

 Assembly of the South Pacific announced plans to present the book, The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, to fifty leaders and cabinet members, together with the pamphlet on loyalty to government. 

 Mrs. Gertrude Blum of the National Spiritual Assembly of the South West Pacific Ocean spoke of the difficulties of teaching the Faith in Noumca and the New Hebrides. 

 However,  with the help of pioneers Mr~ and Mrs. Owen Battrick who speak French, it is hoped that greater progress will be made in these islands. 

 Mrs. Mabel Aritera of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands spoke of the excellent relationship developing with the magistrates in these islands, but explained that in over two million square miles of sea there are only forty to fifty square miles of land. She mentioned the need for traveling teachers. 
     Dr. Claude Caver of the

  Sunday afternoon programs at the Waikiki band shell, the production of a four-page newspaper  to be distributed free to all, an exhibition of art at the Ala Moana shopping center and the presentations to leaders and religious dignitaries. 

 On Saturday evening a special public meeting attended by over three hundred and eighty people was held featuring the Hand of the Cause Dr. Giachery, 

Marc Towers and Stanley Dalton

 as speakers, with Alvin Blum as chairman.  Following immediately, seventy-nine friends gathered at the Ija4ratu'1-Quds for the intercontinental telephone hookup. This thrilling  moment came at 2 a.nt Sunday and proved of great interest to the Australian newspapers. 

   The entire Conference     

 felt privileged to heat Dr. Ugo Giachery speak on the beloved Guardian whom he intimately portrayed to the friends on several occasions. 

 The Hands of the Cause and members of National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 met together to discuss mutual plans and problems of teaching. The call for pioneers was raised during various sessions and by the closing session nineteen had responded, as well as a number who offered themselves for traveling teaching. The entire Conference was conducted in English. 

Special                   

 gratitude is due Mrs. Battrick who translated many of the discourses into French for the indigenous 

Baha from French Oceania.

 A public service was held at the Baha'i Temple on Sunday at 3 p.m. This was preceded by the taking of an official photograph on the Temple steps. Over four hundred people attended the service, a record since the dedication of the Temple. The Lindfield a capella choir sang, including three songs especially composed by one of their members for dedication,  using words from Baha Writings. 

 Sunday evening was given over to social activities and an address by the Hand of the Cause Dr. Ugo Giachery, followed by the showing of the slides of Mount Carmel. 

 The last poignant hours of the Conference were unforgettable. The pioneers who had arisen came forward amidst applause and excitement and stood before the gathered friends as Mrs. Giachery read the prayer, 

0 Thou Incomparable God.  
The chairman of the Australian

National Spiritual Assembly

 returned  and told of the presentation of The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah to the

 tion and spoke of the bounty of pioneering. Indigenous believers from New Guinea came forward to tell how they had accepted the Faith. Mr. Tiamuel, a tribal chief from the Solomons, enacted the story of his people and his acceptance  of the Faith with a sparkling vivacity and humor. An Australian aboriginal from the River Murray greeted the Conference on behalf of his people, and friends from Hawaii and New Zealand came forward to express their greetings.  Then there was the poignancy of the Maori farewell and the words which carried everyone on wings of peace to the Land of the Long White 

Cloud.                     

 The chairman spoke for everyone when he extended heartfelt thanks to Dr. and Mrs. Giachery who had given a new vision of the grandeur of the Faith and a new spirit to uplift all hearts: "Surely, we have been blessed far beyond our deserving and can but turn to Baha'u'llah in praise and thanksgiving that He has brought us together in this Baha'i family."

SIX INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES      243

                     4. KAMPALA

     The Intercontinental Conference

 for Africa was unique in the highlights it produced and the emotions it evoked in the more than four hundred and fifty Baha'is from twenty-four nations gathered in the Lugogo Stadium Clubhouse,  Kampala, Uganda. Scenes lively, joyful, refreshing and sad, moving but inspiring, combined to raise the spirits of all to renewed heights of awareness, enthusiasm and determination. 

 A great African animal-hide drum sounded the call to consultation at the beginning of each session and prayers rose in innumerable tongues,  chants and choruses of the believers of Africa — black, white and brown. Here and there simultaneous translations conveyed knowledge of the wide representation of tribes and peoples. 

 The weather was warm and sunny, the flowers colorful and sweet-scented. 

 The messages and greetings that poured in from the 1-loly Land, the other Conferences, many parts of Africa and friends around the world brought a warm feeling of oneness. And the news was good, encouragingly good. Yes, there were problems, many and serious problems, but there was accomplishment and victories, too, handsome victories won by believers and communities  laboring in difficult circumstances. 

 When it was over it seemed that the believers of Africa were poised, ready and eager to flood this vast continent with the swelling tide of proclamation in order that "the wilderness, the mountain, the valley, the forests, the prairies and the seas" should resound with the Name of the Lord. 

 This had not been an easy Conference to arrange. 

 A large committee had labored for months over details without number. 

 For a period the government had refused permission for the selected dates as it was also the season for celebrating independence in Uganda. One by one the members of the committee were stricken by illness or personal crisis. But through it all was seen the finger of God opening  the long-closed door of radio, attracting journalists and photographers from home and abroad to a fine press conference and to cover the events of the weekend, providing sponsors for a four-page Baha'i supplement in the daily English language newspaper, offering a program gram on television though which the Hands of the Cause A. A. Furiitan and Enoch Olinga introduced the Faith, sending a Baha'i writer, Mrs. Beth McKenty, and a photographer from the American magazine, Ebony, to cover the Conference in meticulous detail. 

 On the first evening the friends gathered for registration and to join in a unity feast punctuated  by laughter and loving spirit. The choirs of Kenya and Uganda sang. Greetings were exchanged as the roll call of countries was read. When all had finally arrived, seventeen countries  in Africa were presented, two in the Indian Ocean and five in other parts of the world. Tape-recorded messages from the other Conferences were heard. A great banner was arrayed across one wall announcing the purpose of the Conference, and the auditorium was embellished with numerous Baha'i photographs  including a large colored reproduction of the design of the Panama 

House of Worship.          

 Mr. Kolonerio Oule, chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of Uganda and Central Africa, opened the Conference on the first day, welcoming and greeting the friends. The Hands of the Cause of God started the Conference along its threefold path of celebrating  the centenary of the declaration of Baha'u'llah to the rulers of the world, of opening  the six-year period of worldwide proclamation  of the Faith, and of deliberating on the progress of the Nine 

Year Plan in Africa.       

 Most ably representing the Universal House of Justice, the Hand of the Cause 'Ali-Akbar Furgtan read the inspiring message sent from the World Center to the six Intercontinental Conferences. 

 He spoke of the arduous life of Baha'u'llah in Adrianople and the revelation of the Sariy-i-Mulak. 

 He told of the moving experiences  of the Hands of the Cause on the pilgrimage to the house c4 Baha'u'llah in Adrianople. He was followed by the Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga speaking with eloquence about the history and scope of Baha'u'llah's proclamation. 

 On the afternoon of the first day the believers were taken by bus to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar on Kikaaya Hill where they attended a special service and viewed the portrait of Baha'u'llah. On a far crest of that same hill the new national

 and Central Africa and a Teaching Institute have just been completed. 

 The Ijapratu'1-Quds is a circular building having a round central auditorium surrounded by a group of offices, a library, archives room, publishing room, guest room and kitchen. Following the service, Mr. Eurfi-tan dedicated the new buildings designed by Baha architect Patrick Robarts, who spoke briefly about their construction. Ijasan Sabri explained the history of the I5a4ratu'1-Quds in Uganda. Sacred relics of Baha'u'llah from the national archives were on view as the believers passed through the auditorium. 

 In the evening the friends were privileged to see the exquisite slide productions with sound, Carmel, Mountain of God; and International Baha'i 

Convention and World      

 Congress 1963 and the ifim, And His Name Shall 

Be One.                   

 The second day of the Conference was given to reports of plans and consultation on methods of proclaiming the Faith in Africa. The subject was brought into sharp focus through the thoughtprovoking words of chairman William Masehia and speaker Dr. Elsie Austin, who put definition to public proclamation and its techniques  and stressed the role of individual responsibility in the teaching work. 

 As the representatives of the National Assemblies reported on their plans and progress, it was clearly seen that much thought and effort had gone into the preparations for this great campaign and that each Assembly is dealing with the situation in

  its own region with a fine blend of audacity and wisdom. Step by careful, well-planned step, the Name of Baha'u'llah will be carried from the cities to the towns, villages, homes and hearts of the people. The high and the low, rich and poor, literate and illiterate, religious and pagan, young and old, men and women, all will hear His Message. 
That is the plan.         

 At 5.30 p.m. on the afternoon of the second day a public meeting was held in the main auditorium of Makerere 

University College. Approximately

 five hundred people were present to hear Mr. Furfitan and Mr. Olinga speak. 

 Over one thousand invitations had been sent to leaders in government and public life in Uganda. Each invitation had been accompanied by a letter, a specially prepared pamphlet  giving extracts from Baha'i Teachings, and a brief statement of the history and purpose of the Cause. 

 Following the public meeting a reception for two hundred and fifty people was held at the new State Hotel, attended by representatives  of the government, the diplomatic corps, the clergy, educational institutions and the business and professional communities. 

 Saturday was a day of sober reflection on the problems and prospects of fulfilling that "lion's share" of the Nine Year Plan so confidently given to Africa by the Universal House of

  Justice. As the friends listened to chairman Ijasan Sabri and the reports from each National Assembly they marvelled; for whereas the Plan is orderly and methodical, destined to anchor the Faith in every land, the ways by which God aids His Cause are mysterious and fascinating. Believers are imprisoned, persecuted, and the Faith gains inner strength and outward recognition.  New nations are disrupted, torn asunder with strife, and the Baha'i refugees plant the banner of Baha'u'llah their foster homelands. Pioneers are badly needed hero or there; none appears, but a Baha is transferred across the world in his profession and fills the breach. A white pioneer dies, is buried in a black burial ground, and the barriers of race tumble. A Baha cemetery is acquired. The sweet spur of enthusiasm far exceeds goals — nine Local Assemblies where five were wanted in the harsh heartlands of prejudice; twenty Assemblies called for, and one hundred and two formed where breathes the air of freedom. 

 New believers have been contacted; large numbers enrolled; National and Local Assemblies  formed; Temple and endowment lands acquired; Baha Schools, Teaching Institutes, Ua4ratu'I-Quds erected; whole institutions launched; communities incorporated; legal recognition obtained; IlahA'i literature tans-lated, published and disseminated; Summer Schools started; funds contributed; womep, youth and children trained and the believers deepened. 

 The friends all over the continent are active in the service of this precious and sacred Cause. 

 The previous day a cablegram had been sent to the Universal House of Justice by the Conference.

     The Canadian National      

 Assembly had sent a beautifully illuminated and framed Tablet which was presented by their representative, Roger White. A cablegram of greeting and encouragement was received from the only remaining believer in Africa who met Baha'u'llah, 

Mrs. Mura~~a' RawhAni      
Yazdi.                     

 On Saturday afternoon Elton Smith of Kenya chaired the consultation on the 

Nine Year Plan. Peter      

 Mazibuko of South Mrica said, "Although it was the pioneers who carried the Faith to Africa, it is the Mrican believers who must now arise and carry the Message to their fellow-Mricans." 

 He emphasized the vital role in the teaching work played by the African Baha'i women in his area in training children and holding firesides in the home. "The future of the Faith lies with our youth and children. If we are in love with our Faith, we cannot resist teaching and spreading it." 

     S. Mooten of Mauritius     

 said, "An army cannot march on an empty stomach, and the Faith cannot progress without funds. The Universal House of Justice has called for universal participation in contribution to the Fund. 

 A child, for a time, is dependent on his parents, but when he reaches maturity he becomes self-supporting." 

     Festus Mukalama of Kenya   

 reminded us, "1ff it were possible for the Master to walk in the street, or from place to place, teaching and winning hearts for the Faith, we should not be too proud to follow His example." 

 Saturday evening the believers crowded into the auditorium in the hope of hearing the intercontinental telephonic greetings to be exchanged  by the six Conferences. The loudspeakers  were connected to the telephone. First the Kampala operator, then London — a long pause — repeated apologies from London — prayers — White Plains, New York and finally Chicago. 

 Mr. Olinga conveyed the message from Africa. Then silence. 
Nothing was received.      
It was a low point.        

 But later that evening high spirits prevailed during the "traditional welcome" accorded the representative of the Universal House of Justice and the Hands of the Cause, hosted by Auxiliary Board member, Max Kenyerezi. The chofrs, some in customary dress, sang in the warm and exhilarating tempos of Africa.

 A group of Ugandan children performed a small play 

The Day of God.            

 On the last day the children performed again in a brief series of recitations and prayers. Mrs. Helen 

Wilks, Auxiliary Board     

 member for Swaziland, displayed and explained the visual aids she devised for training and encouraging children in the Cause. 

 Sunday brought the Conference to a climax and conclusion. 

 It started in the morning with an inspiring talk by Auxiliary Board member Pouva Murday, chaired by Auxiliary Board member 'Aziz Yazdi, on the spirit of love and devotion which can carry the believers and the Cause through to total victory in the Plan. 

 This was followed by a statement, lighted with sage humor, by Jack McCants of America, speaking on the role of the Hands of the Cause in the achievement of the Plan. 

 On Sunday afternoon there were four Hands of the Cause together for the first time during the Conference, under the chairmanship of Auxiliary 

Board member Oloro Epyeru. 'Ali-Akbar

 Furiitan, representative of the Universal House of Justice, admonished us to be united and to obey the Law of God if we would win victory for Baha'u'llah. "Love is the essence of all religions and the greatest gift of God to humanity. 

 Baha'u'llah declared that the principal teaching of His Cause was the unity of humanity, and that all His laws, ordinances and teachings were to bring about unity." 

 Enoch Olinga reminded us that though we are far apart we are one in spirit and this will be our strength. "Great mercies and blessings," said the Master, "are promised unto you provided  your hearts are filled with the fire of love, that you live in perfect kindness and harmony, as one soul in different bodies. 

 Take no thought of yourselves or your lives, whether you eat or whether you sleep, whether you are comfortable, whether you are ill or well, whether you are with friends or foes, whether you receive praise or blame — for all these things you must not care at all. You must die to yourselves and to the world. Behold a candle, how it weeps its life away drop by drop in order to give forth its flame of light... As you have faith so shall your powers and your blessings be."

 The Hand of the Cause William Sears was seriously ill, en route to the United States for major surgery, only able to leave his bed long enough to attend the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar service and to pour his heart and spirit into that final magnificent exhortation with which we were sent forth to "mount our steeds". 
He reminded us that the    

Universal House of Justice 

 pointed out that humanity is entering the dark heart of the age of transition, and said: 

"The beloved Guardian      

 told us that we were being swept into the vortex of unprecedented disasters, undreamed of afflictions and sufferings.  The world around us is suffering. 

 It is tragic, but the real tragedy is that the Baha'is within the community may fail to respond to His exhortations to accomplish the task before them... Unless we are Baha'is outwardly and within, we cannot win the victories. Sometimes we appear outwardly devoted and active, but inwardly we lack dedication; we go through the motions but our hearts are not in it, the fire seems to have gone out. We can fool other people, but we cannot fool Baha'u'llah. 

 Sometimes  we can fool ourselves, but not for long. No man is happy without the love of God in his heart... 'One thing and only one thing,' said Shoghi Effendi, 'will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred Cause, namely the extent to which our own inner lives and private character mirror foith in their manifold aspects the splendour of those eternal principles proclaimed by Baha'u'llah."' And then, as we were all there, gathered to hear the words of these "stewards" of the Faith of God, beloved AqA Jan, our "dear father" as he is known here, the Hand of the Cause Mi~sA Ean~ini, was carried down the stairs and into the auditorium in the arms of a loving friend, was gently placed in his wheelchair and taken to the speakers' platform. Every believer rose to his feet in spontaneous, deeply sincere love, respect and honor. Here was the hero of Africa, scarred but unbent and unwavering, Mr. Banirni, sixteen  years a pioneer to Mrica, and in the twilight  of his life, ill and almost blind with dia-bytes,  paralyzed on his right side by a devastating  stroke, and now straight from bed, his left leg amputated above the knee three weeks ago to arrest the angry thrust of gangrene. 

We sang AlldIz-u-Abhd      

 when he entered; we listened intently while his daughter, Violette Nakhia-vt±ni,  translated his message; we admired his stern self-control as he sat in obvious physical discomfort throughout the talks of his fellow-Hands. 

 An era seemed to have ended; we sensed it. Would he ever come amongst us like that again? Never mind — we have lived with the towering example of his dedication, loyalty, obedience, sacrifice, service and longsuffering; is this not blessing enough? 

 Are these not the lessons which no eloquence can teach? How great the wisdom of God, that here amongst the simple, unlettered people of Mrica He placed a giant who would, without the aid of words, teach all Africa the meaning of the word "faithful". 

 That evening there was a final service at the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in supplication for God's blessing on our proclamation efforts and the remaining years of the Nine Year Plan. 

 It was a warm, starlit night. God seemed very close. We pledged ourselves to His work.

                     5. FRANKFURT

  British Baha'is attending the Intercontinental Conference, Frankliirt, gathered at the Centenary 

                         HalL

  The praise of God was raised in many languages  in the heart of Europe as one thousand seven hundred Baha'is participated in the Xntercontinental Conference in Frankfurt-am-Main, 

Germany. All western Europe

 was represented.  There were two hundred and fifty-five from the British Isles. Nineteen came from Turkey, five from Iceland, and over a hundred from IrAn. African voices, Middle Eastern voices, North and South American — even P&kist&nian and Indonesian voices blended with those of their 

Western brothers. One      

 by one they viewed the precious portrait of Baha'u'llah. 

 Together they greeted the Hand of the Cause of God Paul Haney, arriving from Adrianople, the representative sent by the Universal House of Justice. His guidance for proclaiming the Faith in Europe came in clear, purposeful words to those gathered in the Jahrhunderthalle (Centenary Hall), so appropriately named for the occasion. 

 Fifteen countries sent representatives to consult upon the plans for proclamation, their individual plans and the coordination of those plans with others. The prayers in various languages  brought a unity of worship, and all workily differences of a groping humanity were forgotten, drowned out by the tide of love through the power of Baha'u'llah. 

Berbers of Ncwth Africa    

 had combined to weave a rug of many colors to send with a friend as a gift, its bright reds and blues bringing a warm note of joy. The intercontinental telephone hookup was a physical evidence to all of a growing interdependence as hundreds of nations and thousands of hearts were united for a few moments. 

 In addition to Mr. Haney, three other Hands of the Cause of God were present: 

Dr. Hermann  Grossmann    

 whose illness permitted him to attend only one day; John Ferraby and Dr. Adelbert Mdhlschlegel. 

Twenty-one Auxiliary Board 

 members were there. Europe hastened on its busy path while the Baha'is began to comprehend more fully the immense significance of this day as the Conference unfolded.

            J                         

  The Hand of the Cause Paul
Haney addressing the Conference.

  Mr. Haney read the message from the Universal House of Justice. His commentary on the sufferings of Baha'u'llah Adrianople brought an expectancy to the Conference and placed an urgency underneath the joy and thanksgiving. Baha alone have been given the vision to understand the reality of today's world and yet have no fear. He called for a vision of the greatness of the Cause and "a faith within to fulfil our responsibilities". 

 Mr. Haney quoted from the message sent by the Hands of the Cause to the Frankfurt 

Conference of 1958: "The  

 work of Baha'u'llah remains to be completed. No one generation will achieve this. Great moments  require great deeds." 

 Dr. Muhlschlegel encouraged a dedication that would not fade as the Conference ended and as the weeks passed, but rather a total offering to the great things that were happening in the world. 

 "As we become more aware of these great movements of history, as we begin to see how this age is the greatest event since the time of Adam, when man became aware of himself, so will we be able to take the action that fits the times." The action required is teaching, pioneering and travel teaching. With this in mind, Dr. Mithisehiegel quoted a passage by Shoghi Effendi: "All must participate, however humble their origin, however limited their experience, however restricted their means, however deficient their education, however pressing their cares and preoccupations, however ever unfavourable the environment in which they live... The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, the Cause so great, the workers so few, the time so short, the privilege so priceless, that no follower of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, worthy to bear His name, can afford a moment's hesitation." 

 The Hand of the Cause John Ferraby stressed most powerfully the need of the day for heroic deeds, as repeated by the Universal House of Justice in recent messages. When people empty themselves completely so that all they offer comes from God, then will their teaching be effective, he said. 

 As the news of the Conference began to come through on radio and in the newspapers, the Baha'is centred their consultation on the Nine Year Plan. Mr. Ferraby introduced this discussion  with a probing study of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets of the Divine Plan, the teaching charter and basis of all later Plans. He spoke of the two great movements revealed in these Plans: the movement within the Baha'i world community and the movement in the outside world seen in the founding of the United Nations and developments  that would eventually lead to the Lesser Peace, and then the coming of the Most Great Peace of Baha'u'llah. 

 Following a survey of the financial needs of Europe by Charles Macdonald, the Hand of the Cause Paul Haney brought the Funds into a world perspective. 

 He said that the greatest The Baha'is, some in native costume, assembled at the House of Worship.

  flow of Baha'is was coming from the underdeveloped countries where capacity to give was very small, thus placing extra responsibility on the Baha'is of Europe for the financial needs of the world. He also referred to the needs of the World Center in respect to its maintenance and development. 

 Some of the good news shared was the success  of the Faith in Iceland, the nine pioneers ready to form an Assembly on Rhodes, the developments in the Balearics. The goals to be won are still many. 

 Special stress was laid on the importance of the islands around the mainland of Europe, those of the North Sea and the islands off Scotland and Fire. 

 The need for pioneers, for traveling teachers, for sacrificial giving, the need to generate universal participation  became sobering responsibilities, almost overwhelming in relation to the seemingly few available to carry on the tasks. Slowly, through the fear that the challenge was too great, came the realization that not the few souls but only the power of God would win the objectives. Some results were immediately apparent — several volunteered to pioneer, some started on their way. New confidence was engendered to sail with unbounded faith upon the "unknown sea" of proclamation. 

 A full conference hail heard Mr. Haney give clear answers to a troubled world at the public meeting held on Sunday evening. 

 Just prior to the opening of the Conference a reception was held at the Continental Hotel attended by a number of dignitaries, including Dr. Ernst Benz, Professor of Comparative Religion at Marburg, who had spoken on the Faith on a series of national broadcasts. 

 A press conference  attracted Dr. Barres, Director of 

Social Studies at Palermo. 

 A special session xvas devoted to youth. Charles loas of Spain, Auxiliary Board member,  stressed their "energy, enthusiasm, imagination  and spirituality" on which is based the "future strength of the Faith".

  showed their practical approach to the real challenges when they asked the adults to give them more intense moral education to help them live up to the required standards. This education, they said, must be frank and allow the youth to freely discuss the pressures they feel today in the outside world. Inter-religious round table discussions, special group trips to goal towns, literature with quotations relevant to youth, holiday teaching — these were just a few of the ideas generated. 

 The Conference concluded with a final address by the Hand of the Cause Paul Haney and the friends returned to their homes renewed  and refreshed, more aware than ever of the glorious task to which their efforts had been and were to be directed. 

 Fresh in their memories were the words of the message cabled by the Universal House of Justice in response to the cable sent to the World Center from the

  The spirit of the European Conference is best summed up in the words of an observer: "The significance of this Conference and the others with which it was linked in so many ways — by phone, by love, by common worship and purpose  and by a common authority on earth that had called them together — was in fact too overwhelming for people to realize and fully understand. 

 Its place in history is dimly seen as we Look back at the history of God's renewed religion, at the turmoil of a century in which a bewildered continent lost its empires and its glory, at the sacrifice of those who had labored to bring the new truth. But its true significance will be seen only after the spiritual rebirth of Europe is apparent, not only to Baha'is in the spirit of such momentous gatherings, but to everyone.~~

 the Indian teachers to come upon the platform. Among them was a badly crippled old man who must walk with crutches on the tips of his toes. This gentleman has walked through the villages of India enrolling thousands under the banner of the Faith. Also called to the stage were five of the first Tibetans to become Baha'is from among the Tibetan refugees in northern India.

 In summing  up, the minister, Jagjivan Ram, spoke with warmth and eloquence about the Baha'i Faith and said that the Message of Baha'u'llah, the Prophet for the present age, provided the foundation for a spiritual basis of universal peace and that in it one found all the ancient wisdom expressed in terms of the needs of a modern age. He further said that in his opinion every rational person is a potential Baha'i, and he wished the Baha'is every success in their endeavours. 

 On the evening of October 9, a delegation of four friends, including the Hand of the Cause A. Q. Faizi, had an audience with His Excellency  the President of India, Dr. Zakir Hussain.

     The Deputy Prime Minister  

 of India, Mr. Morarji Desai, received a delegation from the Intercontinental 

Conference on Tuesday      

 at 3 p.m., consisting of representatives from countries literally encircling the globe. Mr. Faizi, General 'Ahi'i and Dr. VarqA were first presented, followed by the introduction of individuals from most of the thirty countries represented at the Conference. As individuals were being introduced to him, Mr. Desai commented  on the wide spread of the Baha'i Faith. Mter these introductions Mr. Desai invited eyeryone to sit at a long conference table in his office where he gave a short talk stating that he believed in alI religions, including the Baha Faith. Mr. Faizi told him about a Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha in which the Master foretold of the future spiritual importance of India. 

 General 'AIA'i told of meeting Mr. Nehru some years ago and of his friendly attitude toward the Faith. 

 Dr. C. J. Sundram, representative of the National Assembly of Malaysia, chaired the Wednesday session after an address by IshrAq KhAvari, internationally known Baha teacher from frAn, when the role of youth in teaching the Faith in Asia was discussed. 

 Some of the youth spoke on their teaching experiences among the masses and urged other youth to come forward. 

During the Conference      

 a special program was arranged by the youth to discuss teaching in colleges. Dr. Suzuki, representative of the National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia, chaired an afternoon session highlighted by the Hands of the Cause and the Auxiliary Board members. 

 A reception for the dignitaries of India and abroad was held at the Hotel Oberoi Intercontinental  at 5.30 p.m. The guest of honor was the Mayor of Delhi, It was attended by about a thousand persons and the hall was filled to

 capacity. The Hand of the Cause A. Q. Faizi was the chief speaker and was well received. 

 One of the important features of the Conference  was the arrangement made to lodge and board the Indian Baha at the Talkatora Garden where well over two thousand believers stayed. The whole ground, measuring over half a mile, was covered with huge tents partitioned into compartments to house the various representations.  Separate arrangements were made for women and children. A temporary telephone  connection, first-aid camps supervised by Baha'i doctors, loudspeaker connections and a reception and registration office were provided to make the stay of the friends a happy and memorable one. Night sessions were regularly held there for the benefit of the Ilindi-speaking believers who came forward to relate their experiences of various ways in which they became Baha'is. Many volunteered as pioneers and teachers; including a number of very new Baha'is. 

 Immediately after the Conference a press interview was organized for two days, October 12 — 13, the first press conference in the history of the Faith in India. 

 The conference was honored by the chief guest, J. R. Mudholkar, president of the Press Council of India, who remarked:".. 

 All spiritual teachings speak of a common source for all creation, yet we continue  to separate each other. The only effective way in which man can hope to be saved from nuclear warfare is to launch a concerted  spiritual movement for the regeneration of mankind. The Baha'i Faith, from what I have been able to gather, contains a universal medicine. 

 Itis myinstruction to the representatives of the press here today to continue a regular discussion on this subject and to be the avant-garde  of the new world which is to be ushered in soon. 

 If the press serves humanity in this way, you would be focusing public attention upon the most important aspect of life, the spiritual development of man." 

 The press conference consisted of twelve sessions comprised of panel discussions or lectures, talks by various Baha in which selected subjects were presented to the press. Each session was followed by questions or comments.

 of the press wa~ under the guidance of Auxiliary Board member Keith de Fob. 

 The Hand of the Cause A. Q. Faizi is to be warmly thanked for the wise and thoughtful comments he provided at the conclusion of many of the press sessions. His calm and loving wisdom provided the perfect  background for every subject. He commanded  great respect from everyone and his summing up always gave the subject a new and larger scope. 

 K.     H. Vajdi, secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of India, has written: "This great Intercontinental Conference which was so anxiously awaited in the picturesque metropolis of New Delhi was all too quickly over. To most of us it all seemed like a beautiful dream come true in the garden of delight. Some of the friends were heard to say, 'Perhaps we may not be able to meet again,' while those of younger age promised to meet again at one of the InterOceanic Conferences. 

 Thus came to an end yet one more gmat and glorious gathering reminiscent of the Baha'i 

World Congress in London." 

 Those who attended the Conference departed for their homes with a heightened awareness of the significance of the task to which the Universal  House of Justice directed their attention in the cable sent to the Conference on October 9:

                   YOUTH ACTIVITY

  A MIGHTY crescendo of activity among Baha youth coupled with increased receptivity to the Teachings by their non-KBahA'i contemporaries was a significant development during the period covered by this report (1963 — 1968). The upward trend in the enrollment of youth indicated that a period of rapid expansion of the Faith was in prospect.' 

 This ever-increasing interest by youth in the Baha'i Teachings was set against the wave of immorality and permissiveness sweeping through the ranks of young people the world over — the rise in the incidence of drug use among teenagers, resentment of parental authority, sexual promiscuity, campus unrest and rioting, excesses in deportment and dress, affronts to law and order, and a general revolt against what was ambiguously referred to as "the establishment". 

 In an effort to fortify Baha'i youth in their teaching activity and to enable them to resist the temptations of the wave of materialism engulfing contemporary society, the Universal House of Justice sent out the following letter: 

June 10, 1966              
To the Baha'i Youth in    

Every Land. Dear Baha'i    

 Friends, In country after country the achievements of Baha'i youth are increasingly advancing the work of the Nine Year Plan and arousing the admiration of their fellow believers. 

 From the very beginning of the Baha Era, youth have played a vital part in the promulgation of 

God's Revelation. The      

 DAb Himself was but twenty-five years old when He declared His Mission, while many of the Letters of the Living were even younger. 

 The Master, as a very young man, was called upon to shoulder heavy responsibilities in the service of His Father in 'IrAq and Turkey; and His brother, the Purest Branch, yielded up his life to God in the Most Great Prison at the age of twenty-two that the servants of God might "be quickened, and all that dwell on earth be united". Shoghi Effendi was a student at Oxford when called to the 1 For example, during the year 1966 — 67 the United States Baha'i community increased by 13% while the increase among youth was nearly 35%. 

 throne of his Guardianship, and many of the Knights of Baha'u'llah, who won imperishable fame during the Ten Year Crusade, were young people. Let it, therefore, never be imagined that youth must await their years of maturity before they can render invaluable services to the Cause of God. 

 For any person, whether Baha or not, his youthful years are those in which he will make many decisions which will set the course of his life. In these years he is most likely to choose his life's work, complete his education, begin to earn his own living, marry, and start to raise his own family. 

 Most important of all, it is during this period that the mind is most questing  and that the spiritual values that will guide the person's future behaviour are adopted. These factors present Baha youth with their greatest opportunities, their greatest challenges, and their greatest tests — opportunities to truly apprehend the teachings of their Faith and to give them to their contemporaries, challenges to overcome the pressures of the world and to provide leadership for their and succeeding generations, and tests enabling them to exemplify  in their lives the high moral standards set forth in the Baha'i writings. 

 Indeed, the Guardian wrote of the Baha youth that it is they "who can contribute so decisively to the virility, the purity, and the driving force of the life of the Baha'i community, and upon whom must depend the future orientation of its destiny, and the complete unfoldment of the potentialities with which God has endowed it." Those who now are in their teens and twenties are faced with a special challenge and can seize an opportunity that is unique in human history. 

During the Ten Year Crusade

 — the ninth part of that majestic process described so vividly by our beloved Guardian — the community of the Most Great Name spread with the speed of lightning over the major territories and islands of the globe, increased manifoldly its manpower and resources, saw the beginning of the entry of the peoples by troops into the Cause of God, and completed 259


<p260>
260                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 the structure of the Administrative Order of Baha'u'llah. Now, firmly established in the world, the Cause, in the opening years of the tenth part of that same process, is perceptibly emerging from the obscurity that has, for the most part, shrouded it since its inception and is arising to challenge the outworn concepts of a corrupt society and proclaim the solution for the agonizing problems of a disordered humanity. 

 During the lifetime of those who are now young the condition of the world, and the place of the Baha'i Cause in it, will change immeasurably,  for we are entering a highly critical phase in this era of transition. 

 Three great fields of service lie open before young Baha'is, in which they will simultaneously be remaking the character of human society and preparing themselves for the work they can undertake later in their lives. 

 First, the foundation of all their other accomplishments, is their study of the teachings, the spiritualization of their lives, and the forming of their characters in accordance with the standards of Baha'u'llah. As the moral standards  of the people around us collapse and decay, whether of the centuries-old civilizations of the East, the more recent cultures of Christendom and Is1~m, or of the rapidly changing tribal societies of the world, the Baha'is must increasingly stand out as pillars of righteousness and forbearance. The life of a Baha'i will be characterized by truthfulness and decency; he will walk uprightly among his fellowmen, dependent upon none save God, yet linked by bonds of love and brotherhood with all mankind; he will be entirely detached from the loose standards, the decadent theories, the frenetic experimentation, the desperation of presentday society, will look upon his neighbours with a bright and friendly face, and be a beacon light and a haven for all those who would emulate his strength of character and assurance of soul. 

 The second field of service, which is linked intimately with the first, is teaching the Faith, particularly to their fellow youth, among whom are some of the most open and seeking minds in the world. Not yet having acquired all the responsibilities of a family or a long-established home and job, youth can the more easily choose where they will live and study or work. In the world at large young people travel hither and thither seeking amusement, educa lion, and experiences. 

 Baha'i youth, bearing the incomparable treasure of the Word of God for this Day, can harness this mobility into service for mankind and can choose their places of residence, their areas of travel, and their types of work with the goal in mind of how they can best serve the Faith. 

 The third field of service is the preparation by youth for their later years. 

 It is the obligation of a Baha to educate his children; likewise it is the duty of the children to acquire knowledge of the arts and sciences and to learn a trade or a profession whereby they, in turn, can earn their living and support their families. 

 This, for a Baha youth, is in itself a service to God, a service, moreover, which can be combined wjth teaching the Faith and often with pioneering. The Baha community will need men and women of many skills and qualifications; for, as it grows in size the sphere of its activities in the life of society will increase and diversify. Let Baha youth, therefore, consider the best ways in which they can use and develop their native abilities for the service of mankind and the Cause of God, whether this be as farmers, teachers, doctors, artisans, musicians, or any one of the multitude of livelihoods that are open to them. 

 When studying at school or university Baha'i youth will often find themselves in the unusual and slightly embarrassing position of having a more profound insight into a subject than their instructors. 

 The Teachings of Baha'u'llah throw light on so many aspects of human life and knowledge that a Baha'i must learn, earlier than most, to weigh the information that is given to him rather than to accept it blindly. A Baha'i has the advantage of the Divine Revelation  for this ago, which shines like a searchlight on so many problems that baffle modern thinkers; ho must therefore develop the ability to learn everything from those around him, showing proper humility before his teachers, but always relating what he heas to the Baha'i teachings, for they will enable him to sort out the gold from the dross of human error. 

 Paralleling the growth of their inner life through prayer, meditation, service, and study of the teachings, Baha'i youth have the opportunity  to learn in practice the very functioning of the Order of Baha'u'llah.

  mittees, they can develop the wonderful skill of Baha'i consultation, thus tracing new paths of human corporate action. Consultation is no easy skill to learn, requiring as it does the subjugation  of all egotism and unruly passions, the cultivation of frankness and freedom ofthought as well as courtesy, openness of mind, and wholehearted acquiescence in a majority decision. 

 In this field Baha youth may demonstrate  the efficiency, the vigour, the access of unity which arise from true consultation and, by contrast, demonstrate the futility of partisanship, lobbying, debate, secret diplomacy, and unilateral action which characterize modern affairs. Youth also take part in the life of the Baha'i community as a whole and promote  a society in which all generations —  elderly, middle-aged, youth, children — are fully integrated and make up an organic whole. By refusing to carry over the antagonisms and mistrust between the generations which perplex and bedevil modem society, they will again demonstrate the healing and life-giving nature of their religion. 

 The Nine Year Plan has just entered its third year. 

 The youth have already played a vital part in winning its goals. We now call upon them, with great love and highest hopes and the assurance of our feryent prayers, to consider, individually and in consultation, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances, those steps which they should take now to deepen themselves in their knowledge of the D~vi~e Message, to develop their characters after the pattern of the Master, to acquire those skills, trades, and professions in which they can best serve God and man, to intensify their service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, and to radiate its Message to the seekers among their contemporaries. 

 The effect of this letter is indicated in the following extract from a report, written by a Baha'i youth in the United States for the National Spiritual Assembly of that country: "These formative years (1963 — 68) of the American Baha'i youth movement were punctuated  by a letter from the Universal House of Justice dated June 10, 1966 and addressed 'To the Baha'i Youth in every Land.' It was the first communication of its kind to be sent out from the World Centre of the Faith. The letter, written in masterful prose, outlined three great fields of service to the Faith which lie before all youth.. The letter came without warning at a time when many youth were gathered at summer  project training sessions where it was quickly reproduced and distributed. lit was received with surprise and awe, almost with disbelief, by youth gathered at these sessions, The words of this letter, though only dimly understood at the time, sunk deeply into the consciousness of all youth who read them. This letter. became a standard of youth identity and set a tone for youth activities for some time. 

 it was distributed to every Baha youth in the country and was studied again and again at youth conferences and institutes. 

 In later years, quotations from 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi on Baha'i youth and their special mission in the Faith were to become more common. But for a time this letter was the primary source of direction for Baha'i youth activities... 

 "During the years from 1963 to 1968, within the American nation as a whole, youth in huge numbers were shaken to a new awareness of the decay and corruption of their society. A new youth culture grew to claim the allegiance of millions of alienated young people who had rejected the old order, but had not yet discovered  the new one. This mood of the youth culture within the United States was reflected in the young Baha'is. Its positive elements affected the Baha'i community as a whole, revitalizing and strengthening it and advancing Baha'i youth to new levels of commitment and sacrifice and eagerness for direct action and service. 

 Its negative elements were largely eliminated by the laws and standards of Baha'u'llah  and the guidance of the Administrative Order. 

By 1964, many Baha'i       

 youth had been infected by this spirit of urgency and activism. They brought their concerns to the National Convention of that year where a responsive chord was struck in many adult Baha who were also aroused by the racial struggles which gripped the nation. 

 As a result, the National Spiritual Assembly promptly developed a program of summer youth projects into which this new energy could be channelled. 

 The area of activist service to the Cause, especially in the form of summer service projects, became the domain of Baha'i youth. 

 Youth were, almost universally, thrilled and challenged by this new arena of se~ice...

project was enthralling.   

 Youth listened eagerly to the reports of the successes oftheprojectsand swelled with pride that youth could win such victories for the Cause of God. 

 "The political pressure of American society had another effect upon Baha'i youth. Stirred to a new awareness of political realities, youth began to read the writings of Shoghi Effendi with new eyes. The revolutionary scope of the Faith suddenly came into view and was appreciated,  as Baha'is began to explore the implications  of the World 

Order of Baha'u'llah.      

 Baha'i youth began to understand that the Revelation of Baha'u'llah demanded changes more complete and more radical than those demanded by the movements that made the headlines. They discovered that the foundation of such changes lay in their own personal conduct. 
Such books as The World    

Order of Baha'u'llah       

 and The Advent of Divine Justice became the center of attention. These discoveries stimulated both a more clear and complete rejection of the values of a dying order and a firmer commitment to a fully Baha'i identity." 

 Baha'i youth served the Faith in a wide variety of ways. The most obvious and most direct, of course, was in teaching and these activities ranged all the way from simple firesides  at home to long-distance travel-teaching projects in far off lands. In between were summer  youth projects involving travelling though their own countries or settling for a few weeks in a single locality where assistance was needed. 

 Two of the more ambitious travel-teaching projects were those of groups of American youth to Yucatan and Bolivia. A team of four youths embarked on a six-week pilot project in the native villages of Yucatan in the summer of 1967. They made daily trips to the villages with Auxiliary Board member Artemus Lamb, a weekend trip to the territory of Quintana Roo, assisted in two courses in the 

Martha Root Baha'i Institute

 in Muna, and held an institute in Komchen. 

 The account of their project in Baha'i News stated: "The inspiration of the example of their lives, their knowledge of the Teachings and their loving dedication brought rich confirmations. Their visit has given a great surge forward to youth activities." 

 Among other accomplishments they, with the help of an enthusiastic group of Mayan youth, opened a new village to the Faith. 

 In September 1966 two young Baha men set out from Miami on a pilot youth teaching project to the high altiplano of Bolivia. They soon learned that Bolivia is a country almost entirely bereft of the material advancements and personal comforts to which they had been accustomed. They travelled by steam train, open trucks, in "rickety overcrowded" buses and on foot to reach the remote villages where they were to teach, and once there they stayed in very simple accommodations and observed that even some of the larger towns were not yet blessed with running water, electricity or sanitary facilities. 

 The purpose of the project was to give them experience in Baha'i teaching, to expose them to the problems and the rewards of work in an isolated mass teaching area, and to test the feasibility of future youth projects of a similar nature. In partiCipating in the project the youths were to contribute as much as they could to the difficult teaching and consolidation work in Bolivia and to encourage the local believers in their endeavours. In addition to the physic~1 privations which they had to endure, the youths experienced the difficulties of speaking  though an interpreter, and they learned of the problems associated with teaching among primitive peoples who cannot read or write. Teachers must be sent to each of the hundreds of villages where Baha'is reside to train and deepen the believers, and yet there are so few teachers available. 

 The report in the United States Baha'i News stated: 

    "The rural-dwelling Baha'i 

 of Bolivia farm the barren land and herd sheep and llamas, raising potatoes to eat and fibers to protect them from the freezing cold and mountain winds. 

 They have only wooden plows for tilling the soil, the wood itself being scarce in a land of few trees, and there is no wheel in their daily life. Disease, hard work and hunger serve to shortentheirlifeexpectancyto afraction of ours, and many die at birth or in childhood. And yet their hearts are so pure that they are truly thankful for that which God has given them, and they were able to teach their North American  brothers to appreciate deeply the beauty and peace of their life and attitude, the perfection  of their hospitality and the light in their worn faces. These were experiences never to be forgotten." 

 American Baha'i youth engaged in a number of summer projects. The following are excerpts from some of the reports:

     "South Carolina — Youth Teachers — In

 the South there is a rapid social evolution which focuses upon the emergent Negro minority. It is a place of bright hope for Baha progress through interracial teaching and living a team of six youth was sent to Greenville, South Carolina to undertake, under the guidance of the Local Spiritual Assembly, a six-week combined program of tutorial assistance to Negro students, of rural Baha'i teaching, and of Baha human rights activities. 

 fifty-five Negro students of primary and secondary school age had applied for transfer to heretofore all-white schools. Their tutoring program, designed to prepare them for the stiffer requirements of the new schools was staffed by four youth... the six weeks were rich in experience, in the planting of Baha'i seeds, in the public recognition of the unequivocal  Baha'i position on the oneness of mankind, in new declarations, and in the opportunities to serve the community and its neediest citizens. 

 "New Mexico — Arizona — At Gallup, in two periods of two weeks each, the girls undertook to canvass the town to inform about the Cause, and helped to recruit students for a free art class conducted at the Baha'i Center.. 

 They worked with the juvenile probation officer.., 

 accompanying  him on his rounds and contacting Indian parents. to staff the Baha'i booth full time, there to make friends for the Faith... in Phoenix, tutoring of high school dropouts and work in the Golden Gate Settlement House was combined with HahA'i discussion meetings both in the city and in nearby 

Tempo.                     

 "Canada — Across eastern Canada went a handsome teaching-by-singing group whose enthusiasm was so infectious that 'it brought an absolute transformation of the Canadian communities' which they visited." 

 No less spectacular were some of the summer youth projects undertaken elsewhere. 

The National Baha'i Youth  

 Committee of Malaysia requested youth groups to elect state representatives to consolidate activities within the state and also to furnish regular reports from their districts. 

 Very high standards were fixed for the representatives. 

 They were expected to read and study selected books, to memorize a number of prayers, and to be prepaied to travel in their state to arrange youth activities. 

 One of the youth projects of Malaysia was to help with the cleaning of the newly-acquired national ljfaziratu'1-Quds. 

 The youth of Kuala Lumpur are permitted to use it for their activities. 

 In Kenya the services of Baha'i youth are summed up in the following adaptation from an article by Samuel 

Obura:                     
     "The first Kenya Africans  

 to embrace the Baha'i Faith were four youths studying at a medical training school in 1953. 

 Fi om these four, the beloved Faith of God has now spread to more than twenty thousand believers (re-siding  in approximately two thousand localities).  Many of these believers are youth under thirty years of age. Through the unfailing guidance and assistance of the 

Blessed Perfection,  Baha'i

 youth in Kenya have played a vital role in achieving this wonderful success. 

 Two main obstacles came in the way of teaching progress: First of all, there is poor public transport especially in remote rural areas, and a lack of adequate private transport among the Baha'is. Consequently, a good part of any teaching trip included travelling on foot or by bicycle. 

 Secondly, in a country with probably fifty spoken languages and dialects, and where academic education came only recently, when the, Faith reached Kenya, only the youth had any reasonable educational standard and could read and speak English. Thus the English language, in which most of the literature is avajiable, was not lingua franca, and the task of translating pamphlets and a few books into the local languages was enormous. 

 "Through the divine love, and devotion, different 

Regional Teaching Committees

 organized  the youth into teaching groups, and these groups arranged regular teaching trips to the rural areas. Many a time they stayed the weekends with the villagers, spending most of the evenings (when the villagers had finished their day's work), sitting and discussing with them till very late in the night. It was during one of such trips to a seminomadic pastoral tribe (the Masai) who had rejected all previous Faiths, and who in this particular part had forced Christian missionaries to abandon their enterprise in the face of failure after twenty years of strenuous effort, that a significant victory was won. On the second teaching trip to this same place, a group of Masal accepted the Baha Faith, declaring that it was the one they have been waiting for all these years. And with subsequent trips many of them embraced

 the Faith despite the hostile attitude of and propaganda by missionaries and priests. 

 "At the same time, weekly fireside meetings were held, and every youth made it a point to bring a friend or interested inquirer. On the occasions of Baha'i Anniversaries, or when a Hand of the 

Cause, Auxiliary Board     

 member or Baha teacher from another country was present, round table discussions were sometimes organized, and these attracted large crowds. 

 Many of those who attended became interested and keen investigators, who ultimately  found the one truth and accepted the Baha'i Faith. It is mainly through the tireless efforts of the youth, supported by the unfailing assistance of the Blessed Beauty, that such tremendous achievements were registered and could be pointed to with joy. 

 "It is indeed very wonderful how though the invisible power of God, His Cause spread so rapidly in a most difficult environment. 

 The Mau Mau rebellion had begun two years before the first Baha'i pioneer set foot in Kenya, and the country was torn with bitter strife, ruled by stringent emergency regulations, and race relations were at the lowest ebb. The churches which used to overflow with enthusiastic Mrican Christians were half empty as the attendance dwindled Sunday after Sunday. Many of those in authority looked at the Baha'i Faith with dislike, and most of the rebel Christians were very sceptical about anything to do with religion because they had identified Christianity with the. decadent Colonial rule, but they gave a very sympathetic hearing to the wonderful message of the Baha'i Faith." 

 By 1964 there were active Youth Committees working throughout the British Isles, some publishing their own newsletters and magazines.  In the year 1964 — 65 in Ireland, sixty per cent of the new declarants were youth who actively assisted in accomplishing many of the important and difficult goals of the. Nine Year Plan. 

 After a special mass in one of the city's most important Catholic churches, the youth of Belfast were asked to have tea with the Monsignor, several priests and a few Catholic businessmen, thus establishing a friendly and important relationship with the Catholic church in Belfast. The youth of Dublin were equally active despite the problems of teaching in that community. 

 Weekend schools, workshops, seminars were organized throughout the British Isles; book displays were arranged and there was participation in youth discussion panels. 

 Youth teaching teams were active in 1965 — 66 visiting weak Assembly areas to establish new friendships and aid the teaching effort. Teaching projects sponsored by youth wore undertaken in villages throughout the country and to some of the remote islands off the coast of Scotland. 

 A number of Youth Conferences were held during 1966 — 67 under the auspices of the National Youth Committee. Youth were quick to consult with the National Teaching Committee about summer teaching projects and to participate in ita plans during the summer vacations. Discussions were commenced  with the National Youth Committees of several European countries to foster international youth teaching projects, which led to tremendous activity in later years. 

 Significant increases in the tempo of Baha'i activity in high schools and on college campuses throughout the world kept pace with other advances. More college clubs were organized than ever before, many opportunities were offered to talk about the Faith from the college lecture platform and in classroom situations, the Faith was proclaimed in many ways, and enrollments among high school and college students multiplied. 

 Throughout the five continents it was evident that JIahA'i youth were on the move. 

 An outstanding example of this vitality was the news from Ujjain, India, that sixty college students, some of whom were from the government Polytechnic College, had accepted the Faith. 

 Enthusiasm, knowledge and inspiration were freely dispensed at innumerable Youth Conferences,  institutes, summer schools, retreats, workshops and rallies in all parts of the Baha'i world. Here youth shared experiences, discussed  topics of particular interest to them, studied the Writings, planned their teaching objectives, and prayed for success. 

 Music became an increasingly important medium by which Baha'i youth shared with the world the Glad Tidings of the coming of DaM'-u'llAh. 

 Many composed songs with a Baha'i theme or set to music extracts from the Sacred Writings. Pioneers and travelling teachers carried the songs of the Baha of Africa, Persia and North America to every part of the globe and eagerly added to their repertoire a newsong written bythe Baha'is of Asia, Europe,

 Latin America or the South Pacific. Both formal and informal music groups were formed, some travelling widely to proclaim the Faith. Spontaneous musical firesides were held, public musical programmes were arranged, and ambitious and creative sound-and-light presentations  were designed and staged by youth. 

 A successful and widely publicized youth chorus sprang up, the California Victory Chorus, which soon found a counterpart in the 

Dawn-Breakers  Chorus     

 of Australia, and later in the United Kingdom. 

 These groups were interviewed by the press, radio and television in various places they visited. 

 Attractively attired, enthusiastic, interracial, these singing groups were widely acclaimed as "the happy people", "musical ambassadors," and their message of hope, joy and confidence in a dissonant age attracted a warm response among all age groups. 

In December 1966 a Young  

 Peoples' Choir was organized to sing at the public services held every Sunday at the Baha'i House of Worship in Sydney, Australia, and at the Intercontinental 

Conference in 1967 "The Dawn-Breakers"

 of Australia presented their first concert of Baha'i songs. They later toured though the states of Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, visiting major towns, presenting their "Musical Fireside" and several songs adapted to the sing-along format with audience participation. 

 A compelling testimony to the striking flexibility of the divinely-conceived administrative  order was the remarkable capacity of the newly-enriched Baha'i world community to absorb such a large influx of youth and harness their zeal and dynamism to the task of speedily accomplishing the goals of the Nine Year Plan. The problems arising from this challenging situation, one youth observed, "never failed to resolve themselves when brought into the open and frankly and lovingly discussed.

 all ages were to discover that the unifying power of the Faith of Baha'u'llah was awesome indeed!" An adult believer who served actively with youth in this period affirms: "Baha'u'llah respected the authority of Baha'i institutions and trusted the integrity of adult 

Baha'is                     

 they vitalized and strengthened the community and gave invaluable support and assist~ce... the Baha'i spirit, young and old, demonstrated its power to meld into dynamic unity elements locked in a cycle of accelerating animosity outside  the refuge of the Faith of 

Baha'u'llah."              

 Wherever they laboured the Baha'i youth had before them a vision of the magnitude of their role in the words of Shoghi Effendi written on October 26, 1932, to which the Universal House of Justice had directed their attention by having his letter reprinted in Baha'i 

News:                      

 "The activities, hopes and ideals of the Baha youth.., of the world, are close and dear to my heart. Upon them rests the supreme and challenging responsibility to promote the interests of the Cause of God in the days to come, to coordinate its worldwide activities, to extend its scope, to safeguard its integrity, to exalt its virtues, define its purpose, and translate its ideals and aims into memorable and abiding achievements. Theirs is a mighty task at once holy, stupendous and enthralling. May the spirit of Baha'u'llah protect, inspire and sustain them in the prosecution of their divinely appointed task!"

               THE BAHA FAITH AND THE

                   UNITED NATIONS

(Reprinted from The Baha'i World —  vols. XII and XIII)

  IN the spring of 1947 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the 

United States and Canada   

 was accredited to United Nations as a national nongovernmental organization qualified to be represented at 

United Nations Conferences 
through an observer.       
     A year later the eight     

National Spiritual Assemblies

 then existing were recognized collectively  as an international nongovernmental organization under the title "The 

Baha'i International Community."
These eight Assemblies    

 were those of North America; the British Isles; Germany and Austria; Egypt and 

Si~dAn; '16q; IrAn (Persia);
India, PakistAn and Burma; 

 and Australia and New Zealand. To these eight bodies have since been added the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha of Canada, of Central America and of South America. 

Each National Spiritual    

 Assembly in its application established the National Assembly  of the United States as its representative in relation to United 

Nations.1                  

 A significant action was taken in July, 1947, when the United Nations Special 

Committee in Palestine     

 addressed a letter to Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, as Head of the Baha Faith resident in the Baha'i World Centre at Haifa, requesting an expression of the Baha'i attitude on the future of Palestine. 

 In his reply, Shoghi Effendi made it clear that "Our aim is the establishment of universal peace in the world and our desire to see justice prevail in every domain of human society, including the domain of politics." 

 The Guardian also pointed out his concern that "the fact be recognized by whoever exercises sovereignty  over Haifa and 'Akka, that within this area exists the spiritual and administrative centre of a world Faith, and that the independence of that Faith, its right to manage its international affairs from this source, the rights of The number of National 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 has increased to eighty-one. See Ba/nfl Directory (1968), p. 560. 

 Baha'is from any and every country of the globe to visit it as pilgrims (enjoying the same privilege in this respect as Jews, 

Muslims and Christians    

 do in regard to visiting Jerusalem) be acknowledged and permanently safeguarded." With this communication the Guardian enclosed  a summary of the history and teachings of the Baha'i Faith which the Baha'is of the United States reprinted and distributed widely. 

 In addition to participation in a number of United Nations regional and international conferences four Baha'i documents have been formally submitted: 

"A Baha'i Declaration       
of Human Obligations and   

Rights," 1947; "A Baha'!   

 Statement on the Rights of Women," 1947; and "The Work of Baha'is in Promotion of Human Rights," 1948. 

 On November 9th, 1949, a letter was addressed to United Nations explaining the Baha'i concept of worship, in connection with the effort of United Nations to formulate a method of worship acceptable for use in its future prayer building. 

 On May 9th, 1947, the Guardian wrote through his secretary to explain why he was encouraging Baha'i association with United Nations: "He feels that the friends should bear in mind that the primary reason that he is encouraging Baha'i association with the United Nations is to give the Cause due publicity as an agency working for and firmly believing in the unification of the human family and permanent peace, and not because he believes that we are at present in a position to shape or influence directly the course of human affairs! 

 Also, he believes this association will afford the believers an opportunity of contacting prominent and progressive-minded people from different countries  and calling the Faith and its principles to their attention. We should associate ourselves in every way with all movements of UN which are in accordance with our principles and objectives; but we should not seek to take the 277

278                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 initiative or... focus a glare of publicity and public attention on a very wide scale upon ourselves  which might prove very detrimental to our own interests. He considered, for instance, the 'Baha'i Declaration of 

Human Obligations and Rights'

 appropriate and believes this type of action to be wise and suitable." 

 Other references in words of the Guardian include the following. From cablegram dated April 16th, 1948, addressed to the National Convention of the Baha'is of the 

United States:             

 "Recognition extended to the Faith by United Nations as an international nongovernmental body, enabling appointment of accredited representatives to United Nations conferences is heralding world recognition for a universal proclamation of the Faith of Baha'u'llah" From cable of April 26th, 1948, a passage included recognition by United Nations as one of the achievements of the American Baha'i Community, "whose spokesmen are securing recognition  of the institutions of Baha'u'llah's rising world order in the United Nations." 

 From letter dated May 18th, 1948: "The ttcognition given your Assembly (as representative of the other National Spiritual Assemblies) by TJNO as a nongovernmental body entitled to send representatives to various UNO conferences marks an important step forward in the struggle of our beloved Faith to receive in the eyes of the world its just due, and be recognized as aninde-pendent  World Religion. Indeed, this step should have a favorable reaction on the progress of the Cause everywhere, especially in those parts of the world where it is still persecuted,  belittled, or scorned, particularly in the East." 

   All NonGovernmental Organizations

 make contact with United Nations through its Department of Public Information, section for NonGovernmental Organizations. The status of the nongovernmental organization has been defined by the 

Section for NonGovernmental Organizations

 in a letter written to the Baha'i United Nations 

Committee:                 
     "The Department of Public  

 Information does not accredit organizations, but aceredits the person nominated by an organization as an observer. 

 This system is similar to the accredit-ization of newspaper correspondents, which does not give acereditization to the paper, but to the man. Of course, the aecreditization of the observer or the correspondent is dependent upon the standing of the organization or paper. This may seem a fine line, but it is specifically designed to avoid the impression that we give status to organizations as such. The oniy way in which an organization can receive status from the United Nations is thtough having been granted consultative status by the Economic and 

Social Council."           

 This defihition of the Baha relationship to United Nations is important. 

 In referring to that relationship in public talks or publicity, the correct statement to make is: Baha'i observers are accredited from the Baha'i 

International Community    

 (or from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States if reference to the national nongovernmental organization is intended). 

     In 1947 a United Nations   

 Committee was appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of the United States, and Baha'i relations with United Nations have been channelled through that committee.

The work of the Baha'i International Community was assigned to our international observer at the United Nations, Mrs. Mildred R.

    CHARTER REVISION CONFERENCE
     When the United Nations    

 wrote its Charter in 1945 in San Francisco, the member nations realized that changing world conditions might necessitate changes in its Charter. It, therefore, arranged for a Charter Revision Conference to be convened in 1955. In anticipation of this significant  event each Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly was solicited for suggestions which might be incorporated in Baha'i proposals for Charter revision. Bearing these suggestions in mind, a carefully conceived pamphlet representing  the first united effort of all the 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 in a non-Bah~'i field was prepared. Entitled 

"Proposals for Charter Revision

 Submitted to the United Nations by the Baha'i International Community", a copy of this pamphlet, together with a covering letter written by the Executive Secretary, Mr. Horace Holley, was sent to each of the delegates at the Conference. In addition, copies were presented to officials of many universities, to librarians, and newspaper men. The distribution of this pamphlet is specially to be noted as a point of future reference. 

 Preceding the opening of the Charter Revi-Sian  Conference, a "Festival of Faith" was held in the San Francisco 

Cow Palace. The seven Faiths

 represented were: Buddhist, Christian-Eastern  Orthodox, Orthodox, Christian-Pro-testant, Hindu, Jewish, Moslem, and Baha. Mr. Arthur L. Dahi, Jr., representing the Baha'i Faith, read a prayer taken from the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Fifteen thousand people were present at the Festival and the programme  was both televised and broadcast by several nations, as well as being widely covered by the press.

     The Baha'i International   

 Community was represented in many international, regional and local conferences of United Nations NonGovernmental 

Organizations. Baha'i      

 delegations  chosen from many racial backgrounds attended international conferences held in the New York and the Geneva headquarters of the United Nations. 

 Their contributions to the discussion  on various subjects were highly constructive and received serious attention. 

 On May 2Oth — 2lst, 1959, at the New York headquarters, a United Nations Conference for NonGovernmental Organizations was held on the problems of technical aid given by the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the social and economic fields. In connection with those in the social field, a delegation representing the Baha'i International Community and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States presented a resolution recommending that NonGovernmental Organizations endeavor to obtain endorsements of the Genocide Convention from their respective organizations. 

 Typical of local conferences, in the United States two delegates were sent each year to the Kansas Conference organized for the NonGovernmental Organizations  in that state. 
                           
   THE BAHA'I APPEAL TO THE UNITED
NATIONS                    

 In May 1955, a sudden, violent storm of persecutions against the Persian Baha'is broke loose — wanton murder, rape, imprisonment,


<p281>

       THE BAHA'I FAITH AND THE UNITED NATIONS

 desecration of Baha'i graves, dismissal of Baha'is from all civil service, destruction of the dome of the Baha'i 

National Headquarters      

 in Tihr~n by government officials, and destruction of the House of the BTh in ShirAz. In short, these acts all denying human rights threatened the existence of the entire community of Persian Baha'is. 

 Cables to the ShAh and the Prime Minister from Baha'is all over the world brought no cessation of the persecutions. 

 The frenzy of the mobs, who were not only unrestrained but actually encouraged, reached such heights that the possibility of a widespread  massacre of the Persian Baha'is became very real. This massacre was, in fact, openly promised in the press and in public meetings. 

  In July 1955, Shoghi Effendi

 cabled the Baha'i International Community to lodge an appeal for immediate assistance with the United Nations. 

 At that moment, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations was meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, and it was to this Council, or to some division of it, that the petition would have to be addressed. 

 The chances that the Baha'is could present their case in time to save their coreligionists was slim. It was well known that the files of the Human Rights Commission contained  thousands of appeals for relief from religious persecution and that the United Nations was able to do very little to alleviate the distress of the victims. It was decided to send a committee to Geneva to make a desperate appeal for help. The Committee consisted of Dr. Ugo R. Giachery, Dr. Hermann Gross-mann,  John Ferraby, 

'Aziz Navidi and Mildred R.

 Mottahedeh, each coming from a different country and meeting within thirty-six hours of the time that the decision had been taken to convene. 

 First, the Committee tried to get one of the delegates sitting on the Economic and Social Council to present their case from the floor of the Council. 

 All delegates, except those from Communist or Arab countries, were interviewed  and to each a strong appeal was made. At the same time, the Committee pressed for an interview with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 

 Despite days of ceaseless efforts, only the personal sympathy of many of the delegates was won. Each passing day brought news of still more violent attacks on the Persian Baha'is and the date for the promised massacre drew steadily closer. The Committee redoubled its efforts but without effect. The head of the Human Rights Commission could offer little hope. Though many were friendly and sympathetic, no delegate or organization wished to speak up for the Baha'is. The day of the adjournment of the 

Economic and Social Councilwas

 drawing near. It was decided to seek the assistance of a competent lawyer to frame the appeal. Mr. Max Habicht was chosen, though at the time, the Committee did not know that it was this same lawyer who had represented the Baha'is before the 

League of Nations.         

 The appeal, together with the evidence of the persecutions, was presented to the Secretary-General,  to all members of the Economic and Social Council who had been interviewed, to the Human Rights Commission, to the Specialized  Agencies, and to the international NonGovernmental  organizations. 

 A press conference  was held and the news of the appeal circulated. 

 The Committee could do no more in Geneva. With hearts made heavy by a sense of their failure to save their Persian brothers from extermination, they left Geneva to return to their native lands to launch a publicity campaign  to arouse the public conscience. 

 A few days before the scheduled massacre, the Committee received the startling news that the 

Secretary-General, Dag     

 Hammarskjdld, yielding to the pleas of the American delegates and of the High Commissioner for Refugees, Dr. G. J. van Heuven Goedhart, decided to send Dr. Goedhart to meet with Mr. Na~ru'11~h Inti~m, chief Iranian delegate to the United Nations, and his brother, Mr. 

'Abdu'll&h IntizAm, Minister

 of Foreign Affairs in IrAn. The meeting took place in Bonn, West Germany, where the two brothers were visiting at the time. 

 Their government had been certain that the United Nations would not intervene to save the Baha'is since the provisions of the Charter for upholding human rights and fundamental  freedoms were morally, but not legally, binding. The intervention of the Secretary-General astounded the Iranian government. This intervention, the efforts of prominent Baha'is in lr6n, the appeals of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States to the American State Department, and the publicity campaign, brought an immediate

  end to the physical persecution and lifted the danger of massacre. 

 Economic reprisals against the Baha'is continued. 

 Baha'is who had been summarily dismissed  from civil service or from teaching posts were not restored to their posts. 

 They were still denied the fundamental religious right of assembly for worship, and their centers were still being held by the government. After months of attempts by individual Baha'is in TfhrAn and many appeals by the Americans to their State Department, Shoghi Effendi instructed the Baha'is to launch another appeal to the 

United Nations.           
Tn July 1956, Dr. Amin    

BanAni and Mildred Mottahedeli
again went to Geneva.     

 They spoke individually with the delegates of the Economic and Social Council, but were unable to get them to present the Baha'i case. Finally,. 

 Dr. Jose Vincente Trujillo, the delegate from Ecuador and Chairman of the Social Commission, opened the session of that Commission with the following words: In regard to prevention of discrimination  against religious minorities, we have received many complaints. One of these, which, in my estimate, is of great importance,regards the curtailment of rights of areligious group in a country which is an honored member of the United Nations and which has a good record in human rights matters — I am referring to the complaints of a new religious group called the Baha'is which have been distributed to the Secretary-General and other delegates. 

 I believe this matter should receive the close attention of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and should receive equal attention with other instances of religious discrimination. This new religion should be respected like all other religions in the world."' 

ENDORSEMENT OF THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION

 On April 10th, 1959, representatives of the Baha'i International Community presented to the President of the Human 

Rights Commission,  Ambassador

 Gunewardene of Ceylon, a statement endorsing the Genocide Convention. For the second time, the 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 representing Baha'i communities Further details of these appeals and the successful outcome appear in The Baha'i World, vol. xni~ pp~ 292 — 296.

       THE BAnAl FAITH AND THE UNITED NATIONS

 Approximately sixty Bahd'ts participated in the seminar at the United Nations on May 21 — 22, 1966, sponsored by the UN Committee,for the purpose of increasing their knowledge about the organization and learning how it relates to the Baha'i Faith. The seminar included a tour of the United Nations,films, slides, lectures auddiscussion. The keynote address was given by Mr. Erik Valters, United Nations Information Officer. 

  located in North and South America, Europe, Africa, 

Asia, Australia and New    

 Zealand, made ajoint effort in regard to the United 

Nations.                   

 Mr. H. Borrah Kavelin, Chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of the United States, made the following statement:  "Mr. President, I have the honor and the privilege to present to you, as the keeper of the conscience of the United Nations and therefore of the world at large, documents which represent an act of conscience of my fellow coreligionists of more than eighty countries and territories. 

 "The resolution they have adopted reads: 'Since the teaching and practice of the oneness of mankind is the cornerstone of the religion revealed by Baha'u'llah, His followers though-out  our jurisdiction recognize the vital importance of the Genocide Convention for assuring the protection of small and helpless races and peoples.' 

 "The Baha'is of the world have endorsed the Genocide Convention as an expression of their firmly held conviction of the oneness of mankind and of the human race. 

 "Nations, races and religious groups are called upon to enrich, through their own inherent  gifts, the common treasury of civiliza tion. Therefore, the destruction of any one of them impoverishes the whole of the human race. 

 "Upon the preservation of this basic noble principle depend all the other efforts of the United Nations. By endorsing the Genocide Convention, the Baha'is express, through us, the hope that all the nations of the world will rally around this great Convention." 

     Ambassador Ratnakirti      

 Gunewardene replied  as follows: 

    "Mr. Kavelin and Members   

 of the Baha'i International Community: I am greatly impressed  by the endorsement of the Genocide Convention by eighty National and Regional Assemblies of the Baha'is, coming as they do from countries and territories all over the globe. This is a most powerful expression of world opinion. It makes us feel that our work here in the United Nations is supported indeed not oniy by the Governments, but by the people themselves. 

    "The Genocide Convention   

 is a treaty by the people and for the people. It has been ratified by an impressive number of fifty-nine Parliaments for the purpose of protecting not the Governments  but the people themselves. 

 It is people who provide the backbone of human history,

284                THE BARA'J WORLD

  Representatives of more than forty Bakd'i communities participated in the third United Nations seminar held in New York, May 26 — 28, 1967. The seminar focused interest on those activities of the United Nations which relate to improving conditions for the world's population and to promoting cooperation between the nations. Four prominent United Nations officials highlighted the programme with challenging addresses. 

  and by destroying them, history itself is interrupted. 

 Millions of innocent men and women perished from genocide throughout the ages, but death did not silence their voices. 

 These voices have awakened and nourished our conscience. 

 It is with the ink of their blood that the Genocide Convention was written by the United Nations. 

 We have now in this Convention a meaningful compact between East and West for the preservation of mankind. 

  "The Genocide Convention   

 has already made an impact on human consciousness. 

 The word 'genocide' carries in itself a moral judgment which the world will not suffer to be circumvented or weakened. To weaken a treaty which deals with the protection of life would mean undermininglife itself. It is for this reason that nations have been unwilling to let the Genocide Convention lose its forcefulness by having its concept included in other documents which are not enforceable. 

 We hope that more nations will ratify the Genocide Convention and will adopt domestic laws against genocide. Let us rededicate ourselves to an affirmation of our belief in this great Convention which is so basic to civilization.~~ 

   The Second Indian National 
Conference of              

NonGovernmental Organizations

 on United Nations Information was held at Yigyan Bliavan, 

New Delhi, from April      

 3rd to 5th, 1959. This Conference was opened by the Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, with an address advocating the idea of the oneness of nations of the whole world, thus attaining the federation of all nations. 

 About one hundred nongovernmental organizations  of India were represented at this Conference, including political, semi-political, nonpolitical, social welfare, trade unionist and some religious organizations. The Baha Community  was represented by Mrs. Shirin Fozdar, Dr. K. K. Bhargava, R. R. Williams, and P. C. Auplish. 

 Among the most important resolutions passed by the Conference were those on peace, universality, universal education for peace, and a world language. 

 Several resolutions sponsored by the Baha delegates were also passed. 
    On May 17th and 18th,      

1960 the United Nations    

 Office of Publlc Information, in cooperation  with the Executive Committee of the NonGovernmental Organizations, called a meeting at United 

Nations Headquarters       

 to discuss problems of ca-operation "with the

  Mr. Asdrubal Saismendi, Deputy Director of UNESCO, was the guest speaker at the United Nations Instit ute he Id at Bahd'iHal!, Green Acre Summer Sciwol, Eliot, Maine, in August1966. 

 The institute was sponsored by the United Nations Committee of the National SpiritualAssembly of the Baha'is of the United States and consisted of a series of workshops on the peace-building efforts of the United Nations and the relationship of these activities to the Baha'u'llah.

 United Nations famfly in so far as its program affects the new nations." 

 Each organization  was invited to nominate two delegates and not more than three observers. 

 In addition, each organization was asked to invite a member of its own executive governing board. Some 400 delegates and observers attended. 

   The Baha'i International   
Community nominated  Eugene

 Moye and Mildred Mottahedeh as delegates and Harriett Wolcott as observer. Charles Wolcott participated as secretary of the Baha'i 

International Community.   

 During the final plenary session the nongovernmental organizations were invited to submit statements regarding their work in the "new nations". The Baha'i 

International Community   

 submitted the following which became part of the record of the conference: 

   "The Baha'i International  

 Community, representing the Baha'is of over eighty countries in all five continents of the globe, wishes to present  a few of its achievements in the new nations. 

 "Community centres have been established both in rural and urban areas. 

 In the urban areas, vigorous assistance has been provided the primitive peoples enabling them to integrate successfully into these more highly developed societies. 

 "Since a fundamental principle of the Baha'i Faith is education for all, schools at various scholastic levels form an important part of a continuously expanding educational programme for adults as well as children. 

 "Each Baha'i community endeavors to develop in its members a world point of view leading to a broader understanding of the fundamental oneness of the human race. This serves to eliminate the traditional prejudices between nations, races and religions. 

 "Since so many of our aims and those of the United Nations are identical, Baha'i communities  all over the world support a vigorous programme explaining the structure and pin-poses of the United Nations, an important part of which is the annual observance of United Nations and 

Human Rights Days.         

 "In the field of Human Rights, the equality of men and women has been firmly established in every Baha'i community. 

 In many of these communities situated in primitive areas where the status of women has been very low, women are now increasingly being elected to serve on governing bodies. Baha'is are active in the promotion  of all fundamental Human Rights, even to the extent of the sacrifice of their own lives to preserve and uphold these principles on which the ultimate peace and security of all peoples depend." 

 During the conference our observers and delegates had many opportunities to meet members of the 

United Nations Secretariat 

 and members of other nongovernmental organizations.  Those attending on behalf of the Baha'i International Community felt that the 1960 Conference was yet another step in the process of "strengthening our ties with the United Nations," one of the ten goals which the beloved Guardian had set for the World Center of the Faith during the Ten-Year Crusade. 

 In 1962, for the second time in the nine-y~ period covered by this report, persecution of Baha made it necessary to appeal to the United Nations for redress. This time the events took place in Morocco in the form of arrests and imprisonment of a number of believers on April 12th of that year. It was not until October 31st, however, that they were finally arraigned before the Regional Court of Nador, and not until December 10th that trial was finally held in the 

Criminal Court of Nador. Death

 sentences were imposed upon three, five were sentenced to life imprisonment, and one was sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen years. 

 As the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations was to close on the evening of the 21st of December, telegrams were sent to thirtyfive delegations appealing for help under the Genocide Convention, which is a part of International 

Law. The Baha'i International Community

 wrote to U Thant, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the British United Nations Association, quite independently, cabled U Thant requesting his intervention.'

288                 THE BAHA'I WORLD
                  May 23, 1955
                Mr. Dag Hammarskftild
Secretary-General
United Nations
New York, N. 1'.

             Dear Mr. Secretary-General:

 The Baha'i International Community, in its capacity of an international nongovernmental organization, submits recommendations for revision of the Charter of United Nations and the Statute of the International Court of Justice. 

 These recommendations constitute the considered d views of the twelve1 National Baha'i Assemblies representing the Baha'is of Irdn, India, Pdkistdn and Burma, Australia and New Zealand, 'Irdq, Egypt and Sikldn, Germany and Austria, Italy and Switzerland, the British Isles, Canada, Central America, South America and the United States. Their participation unites a wide diversity of national, racial and religious backgrounds in one common concept of the structure needed to establish justice and peace. 

 In submitting its recommendations the Baha'i International Community is concerned with the desperate condition into which the nations and peoples of the world have fallen. The seeds of destruction are sown within as well as without the present membership of United Nations. No minor and legalistic adjustment of the Charter, the Baha'is are convinced, can restore the supremacy of moral law in the conduct of human affairs nor seize control of events from the chaos which engulfs mankind. The Baha'is appeal to every enlightened and responsible statesman associated with United Nations to grasp, before it is too late, this providential opportunity to create a political organism commensurate with the new and unprecedented character of the world in our time. 

 The Baha'i recommendations are based upon three apparent truths: that real sovereignty is no longer vested in the institutions of the national state because the nations have become interdependent; ; that the existing crisis i.v moral and spiritual as well as political ; and that the existing crisis can only be surmounted by the achievement of a world order representative of the peoples as well as the nations of mankind. 

 The Bahd'iconcept of world order is defined in these terms: A world Super-State in whose favor all the nations of the world will have ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to maintain armaments, exceptforpurposesof maintaining internal order within their respective dominions. This State will have to include an International Executive adequate to enforce supreme and unchalkngeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the Commonwealth; a World Parliament whose members are elected by the peoples in their respective countries and whose election is confirmed firmed by their respective governments: a Supreme Tribunal whose judgment has a binding effect even in cases where the parties concerned have not voluntarily agreed to submit their case to its consideration. 

 Since action by peoples as well as governments is essential, the Baha'i recommendations include the proposal that consideration of revision by United Nations be accompanied by wide dissemination semination of the principles of international relations and the calling of peoples' conventions to register the general will. 

 Impossible as the achievement of world order may appear to traditionalist or partisan, mankind is passing through a crucial stage likened to that of an individual entering maturity and using new powers and faculties beyond the grasp of irresponsible sponsible youth. Unassailable is the position that any lesser international body represents a compromise promise with the forces of disaster and destruction. 
                       tion.

 In support of its thesis the Bahd'ilnternational Community presents with this letter an annex citing references to the sublect in Bahd'iwritings, and an annex proposing specific revisions. 
                                       Sincerely,

                                 BAHA INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

  1 Since the submission of these Proposals for Charter Revision the number of National Spiritual Assemblies comprising the Baha'i International Community has (1968) increased to eighty-one. See Baha'i Directory, p. 560.

THE BAHA I FAITH AND THE UNITED NATIONS                           289

       BAHA'I PROPOSALS TO THE UNITED NATIONS

                FOR CHARTER REVISION

  THE experiences of the last decade have demonstrated the need for certain fundamental changes in the charter of the United Nations if that organization is "to save succeeding generations  from the scourge of war.. ., reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small; to promote social progress and better standards of living in larger freedom." 

 In order to insure the realization of the principles proclaimed in the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations, that organization  must be given real authority and military power to maintain Peace and uphold international  Justice; it must operate in accordance with the principle of equality of nations large and small; it must become the guarantor of human rights, faith in which was so eloquently proclaimed in the Preamble. 

 The authors of the Charter foresaw a time when its terms would need revision and provided,  in articles 108 and 109, for changes and revisions. In this connection, the Baha'i 

International  Community 

 submits, in addition to its statement of principle, a number of specific and general suggestions listed below. 

  I.   Membership in the United Nations being an indispensable condition for the preservation of international peace, no nation should be allowed to leave the organization. 

 It is therefore proposed that Article 6 of the Charter be amended to read: A member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter maybe subjected by the General Assembly, upon recommendation of the Security Council, to economic and other sanctions, and, in extreme cases, may be corn-pelledby  force to abide by the principles of the Charter. 

  II.         In order to give the General Assembly more freedom of discussion, it is suggested that Article 12 of the Charter and all references to it which occur in any other Article (such as Articles 10, 11, 35, etc.) be eliminated. 

 HI. It is suggested that membership in the General Assembly be apportioned according to some form of proportionate representation and Paragraph 1, of Article 18 of the Charter, be amended accordingly. 

  IV. The Principle of the equality of nations large and small, proclaimed in the Preamble, must not be disregarded or contradicted in any article of the Charter. Therefore, it is suggested that Article 23 be changed to read: 

1.  The Security Council  

 shall consist of eleven Members of the United Nations elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years, no retiring member being eligible for immediate reelection. 

 2.  Each member of the Security Couqcil shall have one representative. 

  All reference to permanent members of the Security Council found in any of the articles of the Charter to be eliminated. 

  V. In conformity with Article 23 (as revised), Paragraph 2 of Article 27 shall read: Decisions of the Security Council shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members; provided that in decisions made under Chapter VI, and under Paragraph 3 of Article 52, a party to the dispute shall abstain from voting. 
                          
Paragraph 3 of Article    
27 to be eliminated.      

  VI. The maintenance of peace being a task incumbent upon all members of the United Nations, it is proposed that the first sentence of Paragraph 2, Article 47, be amended to read: 

The Military Staff Committee

 shall consist of the Chiefs of Staff of the members of the Security Council or their representatives. 

  VII. In the interests of justice, it is proposed that Article 50 be amended to read: Ifpreventive or enforcement measures against any state are taken by the Security Council, any other state, whether a member of the United Nations or not, which finds itself confronted with special economic problems


<p290>
290                 THE BAHA I WORLD

 arising from the carrying out of those measures, shall have the right to ask the Security Councilfor a solution of its problems. 

  VIII. Having been written and adopted during the course of the Second 

World War, the United      

 Nations Charter at times reflects the feelings and conditions which prevailed then and which do not exist any longer. 

 It is inappropriate  to perpetuate the use of the term enemy in relation to certain states which must inevitably  cooperate in the establishment and the maintenance of world peace. It is suggested that 

Paragraph 2 of Article     

 53, as well as references to "enemy states" in any other article of the Charter, be eliminated. 

  IX.       In the interests of Justice, which is the oniy principle upon which the edifice of durable peace can be raised it is proposed that the International Court of Justice be given compulsory jurisdiction in all legal disputes between states and Article 35 of the "Statute of the International  Court of Justice" be amended to read: 1.  The jurisdiction of the Court comprises all cases and all matters especially providedfor in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force. 

 2.  The states parties to the present Statute declare that they recognize as compulsory U,so facto and without special agreement, the jurisdiction of the Court in all legal disputes concerning: a. the interpretation of a treaty; b. any question of international law; c. the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation; d. the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation; 3.  In the event of a dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction, the matter shall be settled by the decision of the 

Court.                     

  X. It is recommended that the United Nations adopt a Bill of Rights, which guarantees to every individual freedom of speech, of the press, of religion, and of thought, as well as freedom from racial and religious discrimination, freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, equality of sexes, equality before law, equality of opportunity, and other basic human rights. The individual human being is a spiritual as well as a physical creation and the purpose of society is to provide for the evolution  of spiritual qualities in a framework of unity sustained by law.

IN MEMORIAM

       LEROY C. IQAS              

 February 15, 1896 — July 22, 1965 Leroy, as he was affectionately known though-out  the world by Baha'is and countless other associates, was the brightest luminary of a large and united family whose services to Baha'u'llah began shortly after the inception of His Faith in North America. 

 Leroy was born in Wilmington, Illinois, in the heartland of America, soon after 

Baha'u'llah's Message      

 first reached the West in 1893. His father, Charles toas, was of Lutheran background and had come from Munich to the United States in 1880. He accepted  the Faith in 1898 and served it faithfully until his death in 1917, as a member and secretary  of the House of Spirituality in Chicago, the first Local Spiritual Assembly. To him 'Abdu'l-Baha made a remarkable promise:". 

 thou wilt behold thyself in a lofty station, having all that is in earth under its shadow. ." He was "that wonderful man Toas", whose seed, like Abraham's, scattered around the globe in succeeding generations, to carry the news of the New Day. 

 Leroy's mother, Maria, born a German Catholic, accepted Baha'u'llah with her husband. For her son, she was "one of the angels of the American Baha'i community", and lived to. hear of his elevation to the rank of Hand of the Cause and to participate in the dedication of the 

Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Wilmette

 in 1953, to the erection of which both husband and children had greatly contributed. 

 Leroy, as many have heard, was the Guardian's  Hercules. 

 His "vigorous spirit of determination  and of noble enthusiasm," his "energy, judgment, zeal and fidelity," his "incessant activities and prodigious labours", his "tireless vigilance, self sacrifice, and devotion to the Cause in all its multiple fields of activity" — these arc the Guardian's words —  were greatly prized by Slioghi Effendi as "assets for which I am deeply and truly thankful." "I admire the spirit that animates you Eand] marvel at your stupendous efforts," he wrote to this "dearest and most valued coworker". 

 Leroy was a practical man, of outstanding attainment in business, shrewd, determined, hardworking, content only with success — all qualities essential to the achievement of the goals to which his life was dedicated. Yet such qualities are not unique. Leroy's rare gift was his spirit, which propelled him tirelessly — a spirit of impeccable loyalty and obedience to the greatest or least wish and guidance of the Covenant, as embodied in 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi. He was discerning, undeviating,  trustful in his orientation to the Covenant, and this was the true source of his "enduring and remarkable" services. "The path is thorny and the problems many," he wrote in 1957, "but the spiritual confirmations are great, and the blessings of the Holy Spirit unending. 

 I dare say, no one would trade his opportunity of service, and spiritual victory, for anything in the world." 

 Leroy himself described his life as moving through four episodes: his acceptance as a child and youth of spiritual truth and his meeting with 'Abdu'l-Baha; his years in San Francisco (1919 — 46); his return to Chicago (1946 — 52); and his transfer to Haifa, the World Centre of the Faith (1952 — 65). 

 These episodes provide a frame in which to examine his achievements. 

  From boyhood Leroy was sensitive to the light of the Spirit. When, in 1912, 'Abdu'l-Baha came to Chicago, Leroy led his parents to Him in a crowded hotel lobby by the radiance which enveloped Him. Although only sixteen, he took the Master for his guide, and was aware of His guidance at several critical periods of his life. He was present when 'Abdu'l-Baha laid the cornerstone of the Temple in Wilmette — his father had helped to draft the petition to the Master for permission to build it — and as a young man he taught classes on its grounds. Also at sixteen, after high school and some commercial training, he began work in the railway industry which he continued, chiefly with Southern Pacific Lines, for forty years, rising from an insignificant post to become Passenger Traffic Manager in the

292                THE BAHA'I WORLD
United States. In 1919     

 he was married to Sylvia Kuhiman, and together they set out for 

San Francisco.             

  In his own estimation, his years in the West were the "most productive". 

 (He evaluated them before transferring to Haifa.) 

 As his business career grewin rank and responsibility, so did the scope of his 

Baha activities. For Leroy

 had a creative vision matched by practical sense and determination, and his hopes for the expansion of the Faith were boundless. And he arrived in California at the threshold of the Formative Age, in which, led by the newly-appointed  Guardian, the American Baha'is would pioneer the establishment of the Administrative 

Order.                     

 Almost his first act on reaching San Francisco was to address a letter to 'Abdu'l-Baha, begging confirmation for all his family and his children unborn, and for his own severance, knowledge, and steadfastness "that this faltering  one may be quickened through that Divine Power, and thereby render some service which may be conducive to the happiness of the heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha." 

 He had heard the Master's Divine Plan Tablets read at the American Convention in New York that spring, and his desire to serve had been fully awakened. 

 Led by such pioneers as Mrs Goodall and her daughter Ella 0. Cooper, the Faith had been established in San Francisco and the Bay area for a quarter of a century, and opportunities of teaching were rapidly developing. Sylvia and Leroy opened their home to study classes, and before long Leroy was conducting, almost unaided,  classes of a hundred in San Francisco and Oakland. They had also moved to the Baha'i Centre, which they kept open for all occasions, and to these responsibilities were added Leroy's chairmanship of the San Francisco Spiritual Assembly, an office he held for twenty years, and membership of the Western States 

Teaching Committee.        

 At this time so few believers in the West were available to teach and conduct study classes that, as Leroy wrote, "the situation became extremely discouraging" and the burdens he carried affected his health. 

 He determined to change the situation, to train teachers, "that we should not again find ourselves in such a deplorable situation. 

 By nature I have always faced a situation and then tried to figure out the steps necessary for solving the problem. 

 Thus, during this period of intensive teaching and great stress my mind began to work on steps towards a solution... 

 Out of this period three different plans of teaching came to me. One was to establish in this liberal western area very large unity conferences... 

 Another.. was ... the revised teaching plan which ultimately found its consummation in the first Seven Year Plan. 

 The third was to. find a place where people could gather for a period of one or. two weeks for the dual purpose of deepening their understanding of the Faith and preparing them for public teaching.. 

 These ideas were the genesis of projects which mightily influenced the growth of the Faith in America and, indeed, in the Baha world. 

 In 1912, when bidding farewell to Baha'is gathered in San Francisco, 'Abdu'l-Baha had been greatly moved and had voiced His hope that "this amity shall lead to spirituality in the world, to impart guidance to all who dwell on earth." 

 Leroy remembered these words and sought to arrange an amity conference. 
He found support from      

Dr. David Starr Jordan     

 of Stanford University, Rabbi Rudolf I. Coffee and other civic leaders, but had to overcome some timidity among the Baha. 

 At last, they gave their blessing, and the Conference for World Unity, held at the Palace Hotel, 

San Francisco, on March    

 20 — 22, 1925, was a brilliant success. Shoghi Effendi, "much interested",  hoped it would "prove a starting point for further important developments", and in 1926 — 7, a series of World Unity Conferences  were sponsored by the Baha is in sixteen cities of the United States and Canada. Two decades later, shortly before leaving the West, Leroy took an active part with the Baha'is of the Bay area in arranging another series of four great public meetings at the Palace Hotel (1943 — 4), followed a year later by a wide proclamation of the Faith on the occasion of the first United Nations 

Conference in 1945. His    

 youthful vision had indeed attained maturity. 

 Leroy's association with Dr. Jordan brought him the offer of a scholarship for Stanford University: "he seems to me a young man of marked promise who ought not to lose the advantages, which may be extremely real, of a


<p293>
IN MEMORIAM                293
      Leroy C. Icas              

  college education." But Leroy could not accept, for his family and Baha'i responsibilities were already too great; by then his two daughters, Farrukh and Anita, had been born. 

 Ten years later this decision was fully vindicated when the Guardian wrote to him: "What the Cause now requires is not so much a group of highly-cultured and intellectual people but a number of devoted, sincere and loyal supporters who, in utter disregard of their own weaknesses and limitations, and with hearts afire with the love of God, forsake their all for the sake of spreading and establishing His Faith." (Though his secretary, November 14, 1935.) 

 For some time Leroy had been seeking to implement his idea of a Baha'i school, and had consulted several believers throughout California.  A fortuitous circumstance led him to John and Louise Bosch in Geyserville, to find that they had long thought on similar lines and had even expressed to 'Abdu'l-Baha their desire to dedicate their property to Baha'i service. 

 As John's seventieth birthday was approaching (August 1, 1925), they decided to invite the friends to celebrate it and the Feast of KamM under the Big Tree. 

 About one hundred came from nine communities; they discussed a unified teaching plan and resolved to meet there annually. 

 Consultation with the National Assembly brought the appointment of John Bosch, 

Leroy, and George Latimer  

 to consider the establishment of a Baha'i School; Geyser-yule was chosen for its venue and the first session opened in 1927. This is not the place for its history, unforgettable to early students, nor to extol all those who contributed to its development,  most notably Mrs. Amelia Collins, nor to appreciate the gift, in the School's ninth year, of its property to the National Spiritual Assembly, thus making it the first truly Baha'i school. But these words from Leroy are appropriate: "John and Louise were unique characters, and their devotion to the Faith, their spirit of dedication, is one of the strong pillars upon which the school is built. 

 The Guardian has referred to the Geyserville Summer School as the child of the 

Administrative Order.      

 This expresses the whole spirit of the school, how its goals are the goals of the Faith itself, namely, developing teachers, deepening the understanding of the believers, and confirming souls." "It would be no exaggeration to say," wrote Shoghi Effendi, "that the unique contribution which the 

Gey-servile  Summer School 

 has made.. has been to teach the friends and inspire them to live up to the high standard which the Teachings inculcate, and thus teach the Cause through the power of example." 

 (Though his secretary, March 14, 1939.) 

 Leroy's first decade in San Francisco had indeed been productive, and his efforts had widened to include the San Joaquin 

Valley, Southern California

 and Arizona. But in 1932, with his election to the National Spiritual Assembly — its youngest member — his activities became national and his labours truly herculean. 

 Shoghi Effendi greeted his election with a "deep sense of satisfaction" and looked to his "advice and executive ability" to "lend a fresh impetus. 

 to the work that the Assembly has arisen to accomplish." (May 30, 1932.) 

 He was at once appointed to the National Teaching Committee and served as its chairman for fourteen years. This was the period of the First Seven Year Plan (1937 — 44), which the Guardian characterized "as the first and practical step" in fulfilling America's mission under the Divine Plan, and midway in its course as


<p294>
294                 THE BAHA'I WORLD
an "urgent immense supreme task".

 (Cable to Leroy loas, May 14, 1941.) Leroy was already attuning himself to the coming challenge and, in May 1932, he submitted a plan of work for the National Teaching Committee which the Guardian found "most promising". But in fact it was Shoghi Effendi who was leading the American Baha'is toward their prodigious task, as his messages between 1932 — 5 amply attest, and Leroy responded to every word. Tn September  1935 he placed before 

Shoghi Effendi the Committee's   

 plan to introduce the Faith into the twelve states of the United States where there were as yet no Baha; the Guardian "fully and gladly" endorsed it, and galvanized the American Community in October by heralding a "new hour" in the Faith, "calling for nation~wide, systematic, sustained efforts in teaching field. .7' (Cable, October 26, 1935.) The following Convention received this astounding  call: ". Would to God every State •        within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of •    this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Baha'u'llah and establish structural basis of His World Order." The 

First Seven                      

 Year Plan came to birth to fulfil this tremendous dous challenge. 

 And it did fulfil it, for it established Local Spiritual Assemblies in tbfrty-four states and provinces of the United States and Canada (including Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia) where none had existed in 1937, trebled the number of localities in North America where Baha'is lived, and achieved its Latin American goals. it was "the greatest collective undertaking in the annals of the first Baha century,"1 and it was a battle for heroes all the way. 

 The records of that time are ample and may be sought. What here concerns us is Leroy's share, preeminently his chairmanship of the Committee which led the great campaign in 

     North America. The Guardian      

 called it the "all — important National Teaching 

Committee"                       

 and acclaimed its work as "truly stupendous, highly meritorious and magnificent in all its aspects. In itself it constitutes a glorious chapter in the history of the Faith in the North American continent. ." (To Leroy Loas, December 17, 1943.) And to Sylvia foas he 

1 Shoghi Hifendi, cited The      

 Baha'i Centenary (Wilmette Illinois, 1944), p. 171. 

 wrote that "without the steady faith and tireless devotion" which Leroy had "brought to bear on the teaching work of North America, the Plan might not have gone ahead as smoothly to victory as it did." (Through his secretary, July 6, 1944.) 

 The writer was privileged to experience six years of those "difficult but happy times", as Leroy wrote, when "we were struggling through the First Seven Year Plan, with all its implications of bringing about a balance between  individual initiative and group coordination,,  in the creative field of teaching." No words could describe the debt which the American Co~~ity owes to Leroy as chairman  and Charlotte Linfoot as secretary of the National Teaching Committee, in those years of incredible work, anxiety and strain, which were so joyously crowned with heart-thrilling victory. 

  In November 1946, Leroy received promotion and was transferred to Chicago by the Southern Pacific Company. Thus began a brief but useful phase, coinciding with the Second Seven Year Plan, when Leroy lived near the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 As a member of the National Spiritual Assembly he had been a Temple trustee since 1932, but now he was able to assist more actively as the inner ornamentation proceeded and plans for the landscaping were begun; For the last three years of this period he was National  Treasurer, a critical post for the completion of this project which had engaged the Baha'is during most of the twentieth century. 
       But further horizons were beckoning.

 In May 1948, Leroy represented, with four others, the International Baha'i Community at the United 

Nations Conference on Human      

 Rights in Geneva. He also participated in the first European Baha'i Teaching Conference in that city, where he spoke memorably on the Covenant.  Afterwards, he visited Baha'i communities in the ten European goal countries of the Second Seven Year Plan, and in 1949 became a member of the European Teaching Committee. It was the beginning of his association with Baha'i teaching in Europe. 

 Leroy's reputation outside Baha'i circles was also steadily increasing. 

 He was always a companionable man, with a ready sense of humour, and was warmly admired by people from all walks of life. "We believe in severance but not


<p295>
IN MEMORIAM                 295
separation from the world!"

 he wrote in 1933, and proved it by the scope of his social and humanitarian activities. Member of the Commonwealth,  Kiwanis and Cosmos Clubs in San Francisco, and of the Rotary, Skal and Union League Clubs in Chicago, he was also elected to the National Association for the Advancement of 

Colored People in San      

 Francisco as its first white member, and served on the executive committee of the American Association of Passenger Traffic Officers while working in Chicago. 

 As he added to his multitudinous enterprises much public speaking, and never concealed his Baha'i conviction, it is certain that his life was a continuous proclamation of the Faith of Baha'u'llah to his "legion of friends".1 

 Thus his sudden resignation from his high business connection, to assist the Faith at its World Centre in Haifa, astonished colleagues throughout the United States, who yet respected  a decision of such courage and principle. 

 The effect on his fellow Baha'is was no less far-reaching. 

 When, in December 1951, the Guardian raised him to the rank of Hand of the Cause, scores of letters and telegrams arrived from all parts of America and the world, from individuals and Assemblies, in loving tribute to his past services and to wish him well. 

 Only three months later these friends were stunned by the further news of his departure for Haifa. Again their messages flowed to him, in even greater number, filled with joy, pride, appreciation, and a sense of immense loss. 

 "We are bewildered by our loss of a friend and distinguished worker. 

 It is a shock which we feel deep within." (National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States.) 

 "Words are inadequate to express the feelings in our hearts." (Chicago 

Local Spiritual Assembly.) 

 "We were profoundly surprised, grieved and overjoyed all at the same time. 

       (Pasadena Local Spiritual  
Assembly.)                 

 "We are profoundly affected by spirit of dedication devotion obedience with which you have responded to beloved Guardian's summons." 

(New York Local Spiritual Assembly
in telegram.)              

 "You will be greatly missed by the friends 

1 Quotation from Circular  
No. 232, issued by the     

General Traffic Manager    

 of the Southern Pacific Company, to announce Leroy's resignation over the entire nation. 

." (San Mateo Local        
     Spiritual Assembly.)       

 To read these messages is to realize how deep-iy Leroy's years of service had influenced the American Baha'is. And his decision was significant in other ways, for it focused the thoughts of many on the needs at the World Centre, and prepared them to respond with like promptitude and sacrifice to the Guardian's call just one year later for pioneers for the World Crusade. 

 "It is the most difficult decision I have had to make in my entire Baha'i life," Leroy wrote to Paul Haney on the eve of his departure. 

 Yet events had been leading to this end for several months, and well before his appointment as a Hand of the Cause. 

 In the spring of 1951, Mrs. Amelia Collins, ever his devoted friend, on a visit from the Holy Land where she then lived, described the tremendous and sorrowful burdens of the Guardian. "I was deeply moved, saddened, and agitated," Leroy wrote. "Only once have I felt more anguish when the Beloved Master ascended. 

 ." In October he received a letter from Shoghi Effendi, expressing  the hope that "a time will come when you can devote more time to the work, and internationally  as well as nationally." 

 (Through his secretary, September 28, 1951.) 

 Striving to understand the implications of these words, Leroy consulted Milly Collins and his wife, drew up a statement of his personal position for Mrs. Collins to present to Shoghi Sifendi when she returned, and later was moved by his appointment as a Hand of the Cause to send this directly to the Guardian. He received from Shoghi Effendi an invitation to come for consultation,  but by February 15th the Guardian had reconsidered and wrote (through his secretary): what he needs, I might almost say desperately, is a capable, devoted believer to come and really take the work in hand here, relieve him of constant strain and details, and act as the secretary-general of the International Baha'i 

Council."                  

 We know from Leroy's letters that he faced then a "terrifically hard" decision, that his "steps... faltered," but that with the support of his wife — "a tower of spiritual strength" — he was able to reply at once, on February 25th: "Sylvia and I deeply moved privilege serve Beloved Guardian." He arrived in Haifa on March 17th, leaving Sylvia to settle their affairs V

 and follow, and carrying to the Guardian the love and greetings of a host of friends, many of whom had gathered in Temple Foundation Hall to bid farewell to one who for nearly forty years had served the Faith in America with all his loyalty and strength. 

  Before Leroy arrived in Haifa, Shoghi Effendi had already announced the enlargement of the year-old 

International Baha'i       

 Council and the functions of its members, in an historic cablegram  which first revealed his plan for a global ten-year crusade (March 8, 1952). 

 Leroy was both its Secretary-General and one of the four Hands residing in the Hoiy Land, and very soon he became the Guardian's assistant secretary as well. 

 Baha'u'llah Himself had inaugurated the World Centre of His Faith and had given it a charter in His Tablet of Carmet Over the years this spiritual Centre had unfolded its potentialities,  but its administrative development had only just begun. Thus Leroy found himself in the midst of enormous responsibilities, delegated  by the Guardian, which he shared in lesser or greater degree with his fellow members of the Council. With them, and under the Guardian's close direction, he sought to consolidate the Council's relationship with the civil authorities of Israel; negotiated for the purchase of a number of properties on Mount Carmel and near the Shrine of Baha'u'llah; established Israel branches of four 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 to take title to these properties; and defended the Faith against virulent enemies who, at every turn, tried to hinder and forestall the Guardian in his cherished plans. Alone, guided only by the Guardian, he supervised the construction of the drum and dome of the Shine of the Bib, thus bringing this noble building to its completion and full glory in October 1953. And he supervised the erection, in the space of two years, of the 

International Archives     

 Building, which was completed before Ri4vAn 1957.' 

 At the same time the progress of the Crusade needed constant stimulus and guidance, and in this Leroy had a significant share, both through a voluminous correspondence and by personal I The carved stone and components of these buildings were supplied from Italy by the Hand of the Cause tTgo Giachery, Leroy's task being to supervise their assembly and erection in Haifa~ contact in visits to various national and local communities. 

 He was also making friends in Israel, was a member of half-a-dozen clubs and societies, and lectured widely on the Faith, particularly to Rotary Clubs, from 

Jerusalem and Beersheba    
to Nazareth and 'Akka.     

 And he gave Press interviews which brought favourable and extensive publicity, not only in Israel but in the United States, 

South Mrica and Europe.    

 Not much imagination is needed to realize that Leroy was a busy man! 

 The fact is brought homemoreclearly if one turns to the Guardian's messages to the Baha'i world, announcing the fast-succeeding achievements at the World Centre during these years, 1952 — 7. 

 But only the few who lived and worked in Haifa at this time, handicapped by the austerities of a new State, the conditions of labour, the interminable procedures of officialdom, the excessive burdens  which they strove to carry, and even their own inexperience for the tasks assigned, could ever truly say what their life was like in this period of the Faith's greatest expansion. Looking  back on it in 1962, Leroy remarked, "When I think of the way in which I had to carry on the work here, alone, on foot, with no auto, in spite of every difficulty, of a new State, of new people, of situations within the community..  ." What a contrast, indeed, to his conditions  of work in America. And little wonder that those early years in Haifa changed him from a vigorous man in the prime of life — "Ioas could have been stepping off a Chicago bus," wrote a Chicago Tribune reporter, who was hoisted with him to the base of the dome of the Shrine on a 3-foot square wooden tray — to a man perpetually troubled in health, in need of long periods of rest and cure which he sought almost annually in Europe or America. Indeed, by October 1953, with the completion of the Shrine of the 8Th, his heart was already weakened,  and in January 1955 the Guardian was cabling him: "Be not anxious. 
Rest full month.           

 For Shoghi Effendi, having toiled for decades almost alone and in even more difficult circumstances, well appreciated what his Hands and Council were performing. As success followed success, Leroy received through Abdu'l-Baha RiM~yyih KMnum a number of cablegrams: "Tell Leroy loving appreciation...", "delighted victories. 

 2, "deeply appreciate splendid achievement". 

 And to Leroy's mother he had


<p297>
IN MEMORIAM                297

 written, in his own hand, when her son first came to Haifa: "The work in which your very dear and highly esteemed son is now so devotedly  and actively engaged is highly meritorious... his self-sacrificing labours will be richly rewarded  by Baha'u'llah." 

 (March 20, 1952.) One such reward was the naming after him of the Octagon door of the Shrine of the flAb, soon after he had stayed back from the public dedication of the Temple in Wilmette to complete the dome of the Shrine,' and another he must have realized when he accompanied Shoghi Effendi to the base of the dome on the Ninth Day of Ri4vAn, 1953, and assisted him to place beneath a golden tile some plaster from the room of the Bab's imprisonment at MTh-Kit The most memorable expression of the Guardian's appreciation  is contained in his last long message to the American Baha'i Community, sent only six weeks before his passing, in which he praises "the magnificent and imperishable contribution" made by members of that community, "singly and collectively, to the rise and establishment of the institutions of their beloved Faith at its World Centre, through the assistance  given by their distinguished representatives  serving in the lloiy Land...", and he lists all that had been achieved in "four brief years of unremitting devotion to the interests of the Ten-Year Plan. 
." (September 21, 1957.)   

 A book could be written about these "endur-ing achievements", but here only two will be specially mentioned. The acquisition of the Temple land on Mount Carmel involved most intricate negotiations. 

 The Guardian had chosen a singularly beautiful site at the mountain's head, overlooking both sea and city, with a view of the Shrine along Carmel's flank. Baha'u'llah had visited this land and revealed there His Tablet of Carmel. Except for the unique problems posed by its purchase, it was an ideal site. But its position was strategic and the Army controlled the property, which belonged to the 

Catholic Church. Leroy     

 needed over two years to resolve this tangle and obtain the title deeds. 

 The last service Leroy rendered to his beloved Guardian while he lived was the one most valued — "the final and definite purification, after the lapse of no less than six decades, of the 'The naming of the door was announced by Shoghi Effendi, in a message to the Intercontinental 

Conference in New Delhi, October

 1953, acknowledging Leroy's "assiduous constant care... 

 (Ba/nil World, vol. xn, p. 239.) 
Outer Sanctuary of the     

Most Holy Shrine of the Baha'i

 World. ." It was the climax of "along-drawn-out process" for expropriation by the State of Israel of the entire property owned and controlled by the Covenant-breakers, which surrounded Baha'u'llah's resting-place and the Mansion of Baha. (Shoghi Effendi, September 21, 1957.) In entrusting this task to Leroy, the Guardian had told him that all else he had done, even his work for the Shrine of the Nb, was as silver; to accomplish this assignment would be as gold. A thrill of happiness went round the Baha'i world when, on June 3, 1957, the Guardian cabled: "With feelings of profound joy, exultation and thankfulness, announ~... signal, epochmaking victory won over the ignoble band of breakers of His Covenant. 

 They had appealed to the Supreme Court against the expropriation order and had lost, and by September 6, 1957, they and all their belongings had gone from the precincts of the Shrine. On December 2, 1957, title to the Shrine of Baha'u'llah, the Mansion, and all other buildings and lands which the Covenant-breakers had owned there, passed on Leroy's signature to the Israel Branch of the United States National Spiritual Assembly, in an historic transaction witnessed also by the Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery and Mrs. loas. 

 We who today enjoy the supreme tranquillity and peace of those holy surroundings should pause to recall that neither the Master nor the Guardian ever walked there without knowing the presence of those tainted souls. 

 In all his services at the World Centre in the lifetime of the Guardian, Leroy knew full well that he was but an instrument guided and impelled  by Shoghi Effendi. Happily, he was an instrument uniquely prepared for the demanding tasks which were laid upon him. His forty years of preliminary service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, his unexcelled loyalty to His Covenant, his character steeled by experience to unremitting effort and perseverance, and his practical wisdom, provided the qualities which enabled him to bring them to fulfilment at that crucial stage of the Faith's development. 

 And now something must be said of his activities outside the World Centre. 

 For Leroy managed, between 1953 and 1964, to travel in four continents. His most important missions were as Shoghi Effendi's special representative to the first Intercontinental Conference in


<p298>
298                THE BAHA I WORLD

 Kampala in February 1953, when the World Crusade in Africa was launched; and after the Guardian's passing, to the last of the Intercontinental Conferences at the midway point of the Crusade, held in Djakarta and Singapore, September 1958. 

 Here, as so many times before and after, Leroy spoke so movingly of Shoghi Effendi "that every eye in the audience was in tears". He had the power to evoke the life, the spirit and the very presence of the Guardian, and there are many of us who will remember him in eternity for this. 

 Shoghi Effendi also sent Leroy to Frankfurt, Germany, in January 1956, to assist that National Spiritual Assembly with its project of erecting the first European Temple, and to con-suit  on teaching. 

 Again in July 1961 and in June 1962 he met with the German National Assembly on problems concerning the Temple. 

 Two memorable visits were made to the British Isles, the first in January 1955, on the occasion of the dedication of the British I-Iaziratu'I-Quds during the annual Teaching Conference, and the second for the month-long commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of 'Abdu'l-Baha's sojourn in Britain in September 1911. 
He participated in the     

Northern Irish Summer      

 School celebration on the very date of the Master's coming (September 4th); then spoke in Edinburgh and at the national celebration in London on September 8th, after which he met the National Assembly in session and visited seven other communities in England and South Wales. 

 It was a strenuous schedule for one not well, but Leroy's love for the Master carried him through as, in the words of the National Spiritual Assembly, he poured out "spiritual bounties" on the British friends. 

 For Leroy, teaching was "the creative phase of the Faith", the service which brought him the greatest happiness and for which he had a special genius. After the Guardian's passing and with the approval, sometimes at the request, of his fellow Hands, he found more and more opportunities to visit Baha'i communities in many lands, always awakening in those whom he met a deeper love for the Master and the Guardian; a greater consciousness of the significance of the World Centre, of the functions  of the Hands of the Cause and, after its election, of the Universal House of Justice; and an increased determination to play an active part in the 

Ten Year Plan. These       

 were his constant stant themes, the "spiritual realities"; to deepen understanding of them was, he believed, a particular responsibility of the Hands. He had always been a perceptive teacher — logical, persuasive, yet mild — but now, after his years in Haifa, wrote one Baha'i, "your spiritual power is entirely irresistible". 

 In 1958 he participated in the Intercontinental 

Conference in Chicago      

 and Wilmette, and later that year visited South Africa after the Conference at Singapore. In 1960 he attended the United States Annual Convention, spoke thrice at the Geyserville Summer School, and visited a number of communities in America. This was the year of his daughter Anita's marriage, followed closely by the unanticipated and tragic death of Farrukh, his elder daughter. Both had served the Faith internationally as pioneers, bringing much joy to their parents. In 1961 he met German Baha'is attending a regional conference in Frankfurt, and imparted "a new energy to the work" in Switzerland by visiting all twelve of their Local 

Spiritual Assemblies.      
In August and September    

 1962, though advised to rest for three months, he cut short his cure to go to Scandinavia (July 30 —  September 1), for a teaching tour which included  the Finnish Summer School in Labti, a meeting with the National Spiritual Assembly and Board members, and stops in Helsinki and Turku; meetings in Sweden in Stockholm, Uppsala, Gdteborg and MaImb; consultation with the National Spiritual Assembly of Denmark  and gatherings in Copenhagen; participation  in the 

Scandinavian Summer School 

 near Wilsingborg, Sweden; and visits to Bergen, Stavanger and Hetland in Norway. 

 On his way to the first Summer School of Luxembourg (Echternach, September 4 — 6), he stopped at the Temple in Frankfurt. 

 Although his public teaching was limited by his damaged heart, his meetings with the Baha'is brought them "wonderful contributions of knowledge, spirit and radiance". 

 The death of Shoghi Effendi in London in November 1957 had been for Leroy, as for the Baha'is of the world, a wholly-unexpected and grievous blow. Already he had overspent his health in the work of the World Centre. There followed his most taxing years when, as one of the nine Hands elected to serve in Haifa, he faced with them the incalculable problems of this unparalleled hiatus between the death of


<p299>
IN MEMORIAM                299

  the divinely-guided Guardian and the birth of the divinely-ordained 

Universal House of Justice.

 That body has paid memorable tribute to the services of the Hands of the Cause in this critical period. 

 For Leroy, except when teaching,  it was a troubled time, unfit as he was to sustain the stresses which beset them. The winter months of 1962 — 3 were particularly demanding, with the annual Conclave of the Hands, the crisis of the Moroccan persecutions, the final months of the Crusade, and the preparations for the first World Convention and election of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, to be followed immediately by the World Congress in London at the Albert Hall. In all this Leroy played his part. 

 Unhappily, in London he contracted pneumonia at the opening of the World Congress and had to recuperate in Germany until the October meetings of the Hands with the Universal  House of Justice, sessions leading to decisions of the greatest import for the future of the Faith. 

 After these meetings he departed for the United States for further convalescence in Washington, D.C. and Bradenton, Florida, where his family, always loyal and affectionate, surrounded him. Never yielding, he held study classes in both areas. 

 The news of his intended American visit had been the signal for an invitation in July 1963 from the 

United States National     

 Assembly to assist them in deepening the new believers and inspiring the community to greater teaching effort. They renewed their invitation in December;  the opportunity to plan a tour of the South and West came when Leroy accepted an invitation from the Hands in the Western Hemisphere to attend their January conference in Wilmette with their Auxiliary Boards. 

 Members returned  from that conference "aglow with spirit and enthusiasm. 

 ." for the approaching Nine Year Plan and their roles in it. 

  Then followed Leroy's      

 last magnificent service to Baha'u'llah. From February 22 to April 12, 1964, he travelled to meet the Baha of eight regions, in weekend gatherings in the following centres: Sarasota and 

Miami Beach, Florida;      
Atlanta, Georgia; New      
Orleans; Austin, Texas;    

 Albuquerque, New Mexico; Phoenix, Arizona; Riverside and 

Los Angeles, San Francisco 
and Oakland, California.   

 A photograph taken in Austin is evidence of the frailty of his physical constitution, which, strained by his heart and a now chronic bronchitis, was unequal to the magnitude of this teaching journey, and at its close his fatigue and weakness were such that he was unable to return to Haifa until October. But his spiritual powers were perhaps never greater, as he unfolded his lofty themes, made vivid for the Baha'is the "vital spirit emanating always from the World Centre," spurred them, particularly the youth, to arise as pioneers, and prepared them for the Nine Year Plan. He met nearly sixteen hundred believers, many of them newly-declared. 

 And at the close, he represented the Hands in Haifa at the Annual Convention which launched that Plan in the United States. 

 Significantly, when in Atlanta and Greenville, South Carolina, he sensed the latent capacity of the Deep South to recognize Baha'u'llah. 

 "The spirit of the entire area is afire," he informed the National Spiritual Assembly, "and if the blaze starts mounting you may have a conflagration..." And he also remarked to them on a new development, that "nearly all of the new Baha are young people the real source of the power for the rapid spread of the Faith.. 

 Too many to quote were the letters to Leroy of love and appreciation for this fruitful journey which crowned his closing years. While convalescing in Germany he received an encouraging message from the Hands in Haifa: 

"The House of Justice      

 is aware of the great need for the type of deepening in the Faith which you have been able to give the friends in America, particularly the newer believers and young people who are entering the Faith in such large numbers." 

 (August 20, 1964.) And a few days later came a tribute from the United 

States National Spiritual  

 Assembly: "We cannot express  in words how grateful we are to you and Sylvia for your visit and for the inspiration which you have given to so many hundreds of the newer believers." (August 25, 1964.) 

 It was fitting to include Sylvia, for she was ever Leroy's strong support, his champion, and his tireless companion in the last months of his life. 

 lie returned to Haifa in October, broken in health but rejoiced in spirit, surely, that he had carried out to the last ounce of his strength the Guardian's hope so long ago expressed: "You will, I am sure, persevere till the very end." 

 Leroy died, after some weeks in hospital, on July 22, 1965, at the age of sixty-nine, and lies

 buried in the Baha'i Cemetery on Mount Cannel, near to his fellow Hands and lifelong colleagues, 

Amelia Collins and Horace 

 Ilolley. His death brought many testimonies of grief and admiration from Israelis in all walks of life. He was remembered in memorial services at the Baha'i Temple in Wilmette, the Geyserville Summer School, and in Baha'i communities throughout the world. One will find Baha'i institutions bearing his name, and overlooking the town of Geyserville a Sequoia Redwood grove stands dedicated to his memory. 

 One coworker spoke for all when she wrote to 

Leroy in 1958: "What      

 T feel in my heart is, I am certain, echoed in the hearts of countless of the friends — deep and humble gratitude for the work you have done and the sacrifices made for our loved Cause." 
    We are assured by the     

Universal House of Justice

 that the name of Leroy loas is immortal in the annals of the Faith.

JESSIE REVIELL            

 March 23, 1891 — April 14, 1966 More than fifty years ago Jessie Revell was addressed by 'Abdu'l-Baha in these words: "0 thou who art firm in the Covenant!... Notwithstanding the lack of time, I write thee this letter that thou mayest know how dear thou art to me. As thou art brilliant and pure and haM no wish but to serve the Cause of God and promulgate the divine teachings, I pray and entreat at the threshold of God and beg for thee limitless assistance and bounty. Thou must engage in those regions, day and night, in service... 

 As to the children with whom thou art speaking, thy pure breath will undoubtedly exert its influence upon them. 

 (Star of the West, vol. x, p. 317) Jessie Revell's brilliant record of service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, extending from eariy in the century, came to an end with her passing in Haifa on April 14, 1966. 

 Her story is best told in the words of her devoted sister, Ethel Revell. 

 "My mother, my sister and I first heard of the Faith in Philadelphia — it was approximately 

1906 — through Mrs. Annie   

 McKinney, and attended the firesides of Mrs. 

Isabella 11 Brittingbam.  

 On the evening when Jessie first heard Mrs. Brittingham speak on the Faith, Jessie followed her to the door as the speaker departed and said, 'I cannot remember all you said tonight, but I want what you have!' 

 When she accepted the Faith she wrote to 'Abdu'l-Baha and mentioned that our father had passed away when we were very young. 

 The Master replied — I believe in these exact words — 'The realfatherhoodis the spiritualfatherhood. 

 Therefore  rest thou assured that thou art the beloved daughter.' 

 "In the early days of her Baha'i life, as there was but little literature available to the friends, Jessie, who was then employed in an office, would spend her evenings typing copies of Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha and sharing them with theflahA'is, whom turn would recopy themand pass them along to other believers. 

 "Jessie's dearest wish was to be of service to the Cause. 'Abdu'l-Baha visited Philadelphia in June, 1912. After speaking to the friends on Sunday morning at the Rittenhouse Hotel where He was staying, the Master took a short walk, during which time Jessie and a brother visited the various newspaper offices with material on the Faith which appeared in the papers the following day. 

 "During the meeting at the hotel, 'Abdu'l-Baha said to our mother that He would see us at nine o'clock the following morning at our house. 

 Excitedly, everyone spread the news and the humble home was crowded. The Master spoke to the friends most beautifully andi touchingly about the life of Baha'u'llah. 

 Mter-wards  He went upstairs, and each one had a brief interview with him. When Jessie's turn came, she said 'I would like to be of service in the Kingdom.' 

 'Abdu'l-Baha replied, 'You are a smiling angel; you will be of service in the Kingdom.' 

 "Jessie visited 'Abdu'l-Baha in New York City a few days before He sailed from America. As she was taking leave the Master said that Lie would see her again. Jessie always lived in the thought of again seeing Him on this earth. In 1921 she received a Tablet in which He told her she had permission to make her pilgrimage in the winter of that year. Everything was in order: the expense of her voyage was the loving gift of a Baha'i friend; her employer consented

       Jessie Revell              

  to her leave of absence and agreed to hold open her position until she returned; her plans were all made. 

 When the news reached her of the ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha she was completely heartbroken. 

 Slowly, painfully she reconciled herself to the realization that her meeting with the Master was not to be on this physical plane. At the suggestion of Mrs. Brittingham she postponed  her pilgrimage for a few years and was very happy she did so, because when she arrived in Haifa she was able to meet the beloved Guardian which would not have been the case had she gone at the time originally planned. 

 "One day during her pilgrimage Shoghi Effendi invited her to stroll up Mount Carmel with him to visit the Shine of the 13Th. 

 On that walk he said that the Baha'is must make a superhuman effort. Jessie often said there was something about the way the Guardian said 'superhuman' that engraved it for all time in her heart. 

 "Jessie constantly searched for ways of meeting souls who were longing for truth. 

 With this object in view she had just completed a course in public speaking when the invitation came to travel to Haifa to assist the beloved Guardian. 

 When she told of receiving this cable, she said she believed she lost consciousness usness for a moment, it was so overwhelming." 

 A tribute to Jessie Revell by Mr. and Mrs. Lyall Hadden published in the Bulletin of the Spiritual Assembly of Philadelphia at the time of her death describes her early services in that community: "Jessie's entire life was one of service to the Faith, first here in Pennsylvania where she served for many years on the Spiritual 

Assembly  of Philadelphia 

 and the regional teaching committee, and later in Haifa where she and Ethel were summoned by the Guardian in 1951. 

 "Her years of service in Haifa, her many travels throughout the world on behalf of the Faith, are well known to all, but we in Pennsylvania  have a deeper knowledge of, and a great love for, this little person who gave of her time and energy so cheerfully and efficiently. 

 No distance was too far for Jessie to travel; no demand upon her time too great in service to Baha'u'llah. 

 "When we first met the Revells back in 1936 both Jessie and Ethel were carrying out 'Abdu'l-Baha's instructions in a most energetic and able manner. 

 We had just arrived in the Philadelphia area from New York where we had been briefly introduced to the Faith. Almost immediately upon our arrival Jessie, Ethel and their mother came to call upon us, and every week thereafter these dear and faithful souls traveled the twenty miles to our home to further our instruction in the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah. After 

 we declared our faith they, true to the Master's wish, continued to visit every Saturday morning to instruct our three small sons. So effective were their teaching methods that at one children's session at Davison Ba1A'i School our boys were asked to refrain from raising their hands to answer questions and let some of the other children have the opportunity. 

 'Thy pure breath will undoubtedly exert its influence upon theni...' 

 "Many times we met the Revell sisters and drove them to Reading where they had engaged a room in order to hold Baha meetings. Whether one person attended, or a dozen, or no one at all, those two devoted believers were always there on the designated night, and our own knowledge was strengthened and deepened." 

 It is fitting that Jessie Revell's services in the Holy Land be glimpsed through the eyes of one


<p302>
302                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 of the countless pilgrims whose hearts she won. An account of her passing appeared in the Alaskan Baha'i News, September, 1966: "Late in 1950 two selfeffacing little ladies from Philadelphia, Ethel and Jessie Revell, received a cablegram: WELCOME 

YOUR PRESENCE  HAIFA — SHOGHI.

 These two lovely souls were overwhelmed and puzzled, but they soon began to pack... 

 "For Jessie, this was a return to the land of her heart's desire.. 

 What kind of woman was this 'little giant', barely five feet tall, who earned the trust, love and admiration of Shoghi Effendi, and became a loyal companion of Abdu'l-Baha Ri~iyyih KhAnum and the friend and counsellor of every pilgrim? The beloved Guardian received many letters from American believers but it was the rare Baha'i who, like Jessie, would write to him, as she did in 1948, to thank him for his peerless translation of 

Prayers and Meditations.   

 "En routeto ilaifathe Revell sisters found an additional opportunity to proclaim the Faith. Three hundred miles east of the Azores, a floating observance of World Religion Day was held on the S.S. LaGuardia by Jessie and Ethel. 

 Fifty people of various nationalities attended in response to the invitation listed in the ship's calendar." 

 Jessie Revell's services in Haifa were manifold: she was entrusted by the Guardian shortly after her arrival with the task of sending and collecting all his mail; this was a task to which he attached great importance as during his absences from the Holy Land no one had access to him except his "postman" whose integrity must be of the highest order. 

 Even after the Guardian's passing she continued to collect the mail, in spite of her age, until the election of the Universal 

House of Justice.          

 In 1951 she was appointed treasurer of the International Baha Council by the Guardian and after its election in 1961 continued to hold the same office. 

 Her services to the Guardian and to the World Center in these and other capacities brought her in contact with many people in Haifa where she was widely known and respected as a Baha. 

 "How Jessie loved to be with the pilgrims," Ethel 

Revell testifies. "She     

 loved to look after their comfort and received them with a loving welcome, visiting with them, helping them on their shopping trips. At times the pilgrims arrived very late at night from certain countries. 

 On one occasion a group of dear pilgrims came at about eleven-thirty at night. It was raining heavily. They were shown their rooms and made comfortable by Jessie. The next morning Jessie awakened to find she had slept peacefully all night in a wet raincoat!" 

 A pilgrim writes, "She won the hearts of all the pilgrims and saw the best, the true Baha'i, in everyone. In her quiet, unassuming way she would seek every avenue to serve her beloved Faith. 

 No task was too great or too small. Pilgrims around the world treasure the picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha in Philadelphia or some other small  token from the 

Revel! sisters. Dearly     

 loved by the people of Haifa, they would voice concern: 'Please talk Miss Jessie into getting a car — a little one will do; she goes back and forth so much; I worry for her.' A friend of 'Miss Jessie's' would get a special price in the souvenir shops. Everyone in Haifa knew her; everyone loved her. Her calm, assured manner, regardless of the turbulence about her, seemed to be in natural setting in Haifa. While the Shrines, of course, stand apart as the very core of pilgrimage, Haifa unfailingly brings to mind Jessie Revell." 

 Before his passing Shoghi Effendi had himself  announced that Jessie Revell would attend the Intercontinental Conference to be held in the United States in 1958,1 in addition to the Hand of the Cause he had delegated to represent him on that occasion. 
In 1961 she accompanied   

Abdu'l-Baha RiMflyyih     

 KThnum on her trip to Australia to open the Mother Temple of the Antipodes to public worship. When Abdu'l-Baha was taken ill, Jessie Revell, at her request, visited the New Zealand Baha'i community in her stead, bringing the spirit of the beloved Guardian to all the friends there. 

 "I trust and pray that some day you may be enabled to visit Persia, and there render a distinct service to the Cause," Shoghi Effendi wrote to her on December 17, 1928. 

 "Wherever you are, the Beloved will watch over you and sustain you, and you must feel encouraged to realize that your services, your faith and constancy, will in time be fully rewarded." 

 Ethel's words describe the joy her sister experienced in realizing this long-held hope: "Persia and Turkey were the last countries The Baha'i World, vol. xiii, p.323.

which Jessie visited.      

 She traveled to IrAn just seven months before she passed away. To be in the land of Baha'u'llah was such ajoy to her, to visit all the Holy Places such a sacred experience.  Then too, the believers were so thoughtful,  kind and hospitable in a quiet and efficient manner that she really felt at home. 

 It seemed to me that with that accomplished, she in a way relaxed somewhat. 

 A few days before she departed she said to me, 'Since I went to Persia, I seem to be living there all the time."' Advising the Baha world community of her passing, the Universal House of Justice cabled:

  Knight of Baha'u'llah      

 1892 — 1967 Mildred Eileen Clark was born on May24, 1892 in Manchester, Illinois, and terminated her earthly life at her pioneer post in Turku, Finland, on May 27, 1967. Pioneering was her chosen field of service from the earliest days of her association with the Baha'i Faith, and she never relaxed in this service. 

 In the first Seven Year Plan (1937 — 1944) assigned to the United States she pioneered to Denver, Colorado, and there married Mr. George Clark. In 1946, at the inception of the second Seven Year Plan, she offered to go to Europe and was requested by the European Teaching Committee to settle in Norway where, in 1948, she assisted in the formation of the first Spiritual 

Assembly of Oslo. In       

 January, 1950 she pioneered to the Netherlands and in 1952 was asked to go to Luxembourg to assist in making the necessary arrangements for the European Teaching Conference held there in September, 1952. 
Following this she returned

   Mildred Eileen Clark       

  to         Oslo and actively resumed her service there. While attending the European 

Intercontinental  Teaching

 Conference held in Stockholm in July, 1953, Mildred Clark volunteered to serve in Svolvaer, Lofoten Islands. She was one of the first to arise in the Ten Year Crusade, arriving at her post in August, 1953. For this service she was named a Knight of Baha'u'llah by Shoghi Effendi. She remained at this distant post for more than ten years, later returning to Norway. When the need for pioneers in Finland became apparent, she moved to that country, her final pioneer goal. 

 After her passing, messages expressing appreciation of the services of Mildred Clark reached the World Center from the National Spiritual Assemblies of the United States, Norway and Finland. 
In cabling the American National

Assembly the Universal     

 House of Justice described Mildred Clark's services as "adding lustre" to the "overseas annals American Baha'i community."

MARCIA         STEWARD do MATAMOROS Knight

 of Baha'u'llah 1904 — 1966 Marcia Steward was born in 1904 in Pasadena, California, to the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Rudolph Shiffman and to a Mr. Steward, one of the trio that founded the McCormick Harvester concern renowned in industrial history. 

She attended Girls' Collegiate
School in Los Angeles     

 and spent much of her childhood at her grandparents' home with its huge white columns, its great hail and double grand staircase  and landscaped grounds dotted with greenhouses and gazebos which spread down to the very foot of the canyon. She graduated in late 1920 and made her d6but to a waiting society at Midwick Country Club, followed by a fashionable tour of Europe with anaunt. 

 She was one of that large group of American exiles to Paris, where she lived for a good part of the 'twenties. 

 Marcia embraced the Baha'i Faith in 1938 and was eager to pioneer before the conclusion of the first Seven Year Plan of Shoghi Effendi. She sailed from New Orleans, en route to Santiago de Chile, where she lived in a pension in order to learn the language. 

 Within a year she was lecturing in Spanish on the Baha'i Faith in the University of Santiago.' 

 Marcia had launched upon a brilliant series of services to the Cause which the Guardian described, in his many letters to her, as "magnificent", "exemplary", "meritorious", and "unfor-gettable". 

 Determined to establish her residence in Latin America, Marcia purchased a rather elaborate hacienda on the outskirts of Santiago, entertaining the press and those in education and diplomatic circles. She wrote many articles for the press. 

 Latin countries do not pay for editorial articles, as the prestige that comes with their publication is deemed to be coin of the 

See "Chile and Three Crucial

 Years", The Baha'i World, vol. Ix, p. 880. 

 realm. When her funds were exhausted is not known. 

 There are some who feel that her real pioneering began only after her personal fortune  was expended. Marcia lavished her wealth, her abundant energy and eventually her health in the course of her service to the beloved Guardian in establishing the Faith in Latin America. 

 With the remnants of her means and the assistance of a friend or two, Marcia purchased a property in the mountains of Honduras, near Tegucigalpa. She named it "Karbih". It was her dream that it eventually become a hospice for pioneers and a summer school for nearby Baha'i communities. She acquired it for her beloved, the Guardian, and she was alone there most of her remaining years. An aged horse was her only tie with the outside world during the part of each year when abundant rains washed out the bridges and roads. She went cold and hungry in order to maintain "KarbilA". During these lonely years Marcia's companionship  was in a copious exchange of letters with Shoghi Effendi. 

 That beautiful relationship is glimpsed in the following few extracts from the letters Marcia received: "July 29, 1942 — lam thrilled by the news you give me, and I certainly urge you to resume your historic task in Chile, if you find it at all possible. 

 The formation of an Assembly in that country will be an imperishable crown for you in the service of this glorious Cause. 

 I long to hear the news of such a consummation and I will pray for it from the depths of my heart. Persevere in your magnificent and historic labors. 

 "January 23, 1944 — I am deeply touched by, and feel profoundly grateful for, your immediate  and exemplary response to my request. The Baha'is . will be thrilled to hear of the historic enterprise on which you have embarked. 

 I have already informed the friends in 'lhq and Persia, and sent them the envelope bearing the stamp and name of that faraway city (Punta Arenas), as a clear evidence of the high accomplishments of the American believers. 

 Persevere in your meritorious labors, however great the sacrifices required. 

 The Beloved is welipleased with you and is watching over you. Be happy." 

 "July 31, 1946 — May the Beloved bless continually your magnificent activities, sustain you at all times in your high endeavour, remove all

  obstacles from your path, and enable you to add fresh laurels to the crown you have already won in the service of His Faith." 

 "July 19, 1947 — ... you have, I assure you, been often in my thoughts and prayers, and the memory of your indefatigable and outstanding services has been a great encouragement to me in my labors. I greatly admire the spirit that so powerfully sustains and animates you, and I will continue to supplicate on your behalf the Almighty's richest blessings. Persevere in your glorious task, and rest assured that the Beloved is well pleased with your standard of service. 

    "October 25, 1949 — Your    

 magnificent services to the Faith, rendered so devotedly and energetically, under such difficult circumstances,  and in such distant fields, deserve the highest praise, and will increasingly attract the blessings of Baha'u'llah Who is well pleased with the quality of your achievements.. 
  "October 24, 1957 — May the 

Almighty, Whose Cause     

 you have served so devotedly and diligently, reward you abundantly for your truly historic services, and assist you, in the days to come, to enrich considerably the record of your splendid, your meritorious and unforgettable  accomplishments." 

 Marcia's greatest victory was to plant the 

Banner of Baha'u'llah     

 in the Marshall Islands in the Guardian's Ten Year Crusade in 1954, thus crowning an already distinguished record by joining the ranks of the Knights of Baha'u'llah.  Past connections with the United States government and an indomitable will effected her clearance into an almost hermetically  sealed area, which was then a bomb-testing  site, open oniy to government employees  and the native population. 

 In 1955 Marcia visited Texas en route from the Marshall Islands to "Karbild", her beloved retreat. She was aged by hardship and illness and was physically almost beyond recognition, yet the flame of the spirit burned bright within andher smile was still youthful. 

 She knew she was seriouslyill, possibly the effect of the radiation  in the Islands from which many of the natives had died or suffered a severe physical decline. After a period of recuperation she returned to Honduras. 

 Marcia next pioneered to San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador. Letters described the trips on foot from the city into the remote Indian mountain villages. Water was scarce and after spending two or three days with the indigenous people she loved so dearly, dry and caked mud had to be chipped from her limbs. She wrote that the Indians listened eagerly to the Great Message and that being with them was a great joy to her. 

 Marcia passed away in August 1966.1 picture her, as a schoolgirl, climbing the rooftops of His Kingdom and, in quiet moments, gazing up, up into the 

Heavens of His Knowledge. 
Francis Thompson's The    

 Hound of Heaven was her favorite poem. Borrowing some of its phrasing: 

God-intoxicated, Marcia   

 will ever hear His Breath behind her, His Footfall ahead.

306                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 dearly, Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Cause of 

God.                      

 The first sixty-three years of Charles' life ripened his native qualities and tempered his strength and will for all he would encounter and endure in the last nineteen years as a Baha'i pioneer. For Charles, though short in stature, was physically strong and stalwart in character and optimistic faith. He came into this world a child of the British working class and was ever true to his birthright, conscious and proud of the special inheritance of his upbringing. He had the inquiring, attentive mind of a student, but his education came from the mine and the sea. 

 He observed his fellow men with acumen and love, pondered on all that he heard and read, and carried into every experience of life his "torch of sincerity", not only as a guide to his own path, but as a light and stimulus to those about him. 

 Charles was a Yorkshireman, born in or near Leeds into a large family, chiefly of girls. Times were hard for them, but Charles learned both pride and love at home, watched "real life" in the procession of guests at his parents' boarding house, and was rooted in Christian teaching at his Church school and by hymns and Bible readings at home; he "loved a good sermon His parents were strict but fair and his mother seems to have been their chief support. "We all loved her greatly," he wrote, and was ever loyal to her memory. 

 Charles did not walk until he was nine, but by thirteen he was driving a pit pony in a coal-mine, and at fifteen he went to sea from Liver-pooi as galley-boy in a three-masted schooner plying between Truro, Cornwall, and Lancaster.  Later he returned to the mines, worked in cotton mills, and in 1914 sailed in a German ship carrying coal from Cardiff to the Canary Islands. 

 During this voyage the Great War began; after touching the Canaries and the Azores the crew were taken aboard a German warship, then returned to England. 

 Charles immediately joined another ship and sailed from London under sealed orders, with naval escort, to 

Archangel. Engrossed      

 by the customs, dress and work of the Siberian prisoners there, as he was in every place he visited, Charles made friends, was invited into their homes and eagerly inquired into their ways of life. 

 And he had always a special sympathy for animals and children. 

 Charles saw active service in both World Wars. On his return from Russia he enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps; after training at Hampton Court he was sent to France as a lorry driver. Stationed near Ronen, he often visited the tomb of Joan of Arc, whom he greatly admired. 

 (He was ever without prejudice  towards women.) 

 Between the wars Charles was restless, tried shipbuilding, factory and hotel work, and tram-bus driving, all in the North of England. 

 When the Second War came he managed to enlist by giving a wrong age, was sent to Brittany but was soon evacuated with British Forces, lived though the London blitz stationed at Richmond Park, was trained as a commando in the Welsh Guards, then transferred  to the Royal Air Force at Driffleld, from whence bombers were sent over Germany. Here he saw "terrible sights" in the returning planes and himself made many trips across the Channel. 

 At the end of the war he was sent to Leeds Hospital for major surgery. 

 By 1948 Charles was a storekeeper with Metropolitan 

Vickers in Manchester.    

 His war experiences had disturbed him greatly and he began to seek "mental reassurance" in various churches and religious groups. 

 Thus he came to the Manchester DahA'i Centre where, from the moment he read the Baha'i principles framed on the wall, his life attained its destiny. Under the guidance for six months of Alfred Sugar and John Craven, and through meeting on holiday in Edinburgh Isobel Locke (Sabri) and John Marshall, Charles recognized his faith and declared it. Within a fortnight he arose at a conference in Manchester to offer himself as pioneer to Belfast, most intractable goal of the British Six Year 

Plan.                     

 Charles has said that he knew instantly the truth of Baha'u'llah's teaching of the oneness of mankind because he had witnessed that oneness  in mass graves in France. Baha'i principles spoke to Charles' heart and mind because his whole life had led him to them. They were, henceforward, his constant motivation. 

 His pioneer road opened in March 1948 when, after Committee consultation in Birmingham  and a brief period of training in Cardiff, he departed by boat from 

Liverpool for Belfast.    

 There he found, after weary search, a room with the Copley family, who aided his teaching, and whose daughter Claire, then but twelve, later became a Baha'i. Moving amongst

 Charles William Dunning    

  the people of Belfast, Charles soon met its difficulties, "the suspicion and mistrust" —  "there is a terrifying bitterness here" — the religious antagonism which greatly puzzled him. 

 "For how can we say we love God, whom we have never seen, if we do not love all those around us, whom we can see?" 

 Nevertheless, he perceived that Belfast would "make great strides" should it come to understand the Baha teachings. Within ten weeks he was arranging the first public meetings, to which George Townshend and his son Brian came from Dublin to speak. 

 Charles spent one year in Belfast, during which he saw to his joy the first acceptance of Baha'u'llah, the arrival of Ursula Newman (Samandari) whom he highly valued, and the strengthening of the Faith by other pioneers and teachers. But that winter his health was gravely affected, for he suffered periodically from acute bronchitis. Wisdom indicated a change and he was sent to recuperate in Cardiff. 

 In Belfast Charles had learned what it is to pioneer: to strive to live as a Baha'i, to persevere despite setback, to rely upon prayer, and to sow widely the seed of the Faith. ". At times," he wrote, "things seemed so distressing, and what you worked so hard for seemed to be leaving your grasp. But as a pioneer you had to. steel yourself both bodily and spiritually, to face events as they arise." 

 All this he pondered in his months in Cardiff. 

 By June he could record in his notebook: for when these lines (were written) your pioneer Charles was happy and getting well again." 

 To Belfast he meant to return but it was not to be, for by then the need was greater to open Sheffield before the end of the Six Year Plan. It cost him "a severe battle, as I could not bring my heart from Belfast... 

 But soon I found out, a pioneer must go wherever he is sent and get down to it." And so he did, finding trying work as a baker, and participating in the intensive campaign to establish a Spiritual 

Assembly by RiKivAn 1950.  

 He served in Sheffield until 1953. 

 His life in these years was preparing him for his greatest battle, not only by active teaching but in thoughtful study of 

Baha'i Writings. In Sheffield

 he came to know of IJAji SulaymAn KhAn who met his death in the streets of TihrAn in terrible circumstances, with a song of praise on his lips. The vision of this intrepid martyr was to sustain Charles in his darkest hours in the Orkney 

Islands.                   

 Charles was prompt to answer the Guardian's call to settle the unopened territories in the Ten Year Crusade. He was sent to Glasgow to con-suit Brigitte llasselblatt and chose Kirkwall as his goal, arriving there in September, 1953. (Brigitte proceeded to the Shetland Islands and these two, exchanging visits, were a great consolation  to each other in lonely years.) Then in his sixty-ninth year, with winter closing in on these northern windswept islands, he set out to support himself as a salesman, trudging many miles in country and town. Little wonder that he ended in hospital. 

 In those days Kirkwall was not linked to the mainland by small aircraft nor was its isolation relieved by the motor car. Its narrow High Street was an unblemished vista of stone and old buildings, set off by a single great tree, and its people looked with suspicion on newcomers. Active as ever, Charles explored every corner of Kirkwall, learned its history, attended churches and lectures, and made friends where he could, chiefly in cafes and the street. ..... 

 Our work is to tell the people and leave the


<p308>

rest to God," he wrote.    

 But he was dogged by distrust and resentment, and the oddity of his face and figure called forth ridicule and even personal abusefroni gangs of boys who pursued him. 

 There were days when he walked that High Street supported only by his mind's picture of Jj%ji Sulaymcin KMn. "You are a true Knight of the Faith," wrote Ben Levy in March 1954, "a champion soldier of the Cause. Your privations sadden me, but your spirit gladdens me." 

 Indeed, Charles was not a fragile spirit. A lifetime of hardship had steele4 him for this post and he bravely maintained it alone for four years. 

 Gradually, teaching work developed, items appeared in the Kirkwall paper, and meetings were held when visitors came. But, essentially, Charles was left to win his goal alone — to win it by qualities of tenacity, devotion  and sacrifice which defy description but which, without doubt, opened the way for the founding of the Kirkwall Spiritual Assembly, the first in the island goals round Britain. Charles, however, did not see this; broken by ill health and persecution, for his own safety he was sent once again to Cardiff. 

 The shining event in Charles' life, his "greatest moment", was his pilgrimage to Haifa in January 1957. Quite simply, Charles loved Shoghi Effendi both as man and Guardian.  And the Guardian loved Charles, was cheered by his Yorkshire humour and touched by his pure-hearted sincerity. 

 He expressed a wish that Charles might visit Baha'i communities  in Britain before returning to Orkney and this was arranged. 

 On hearing the news Shoghi Effendi cabled: "Delighted. Assure Charles loving prayers accompanying him." 

 The thought of the Guardian accompanied Charles all through the last nine years he spent in Cardiff. 

 How many times, in gatherings of the friends, he recounted his unforgettable experiences of pilgrimage; nor will those who heard him ever forget. The theme of his words was always the same — the "radiance" and capacity  implanted in each human soul, the value of each one's contribution, the need to carry on the work of the Faith ever hopeful and assured. These thoughts imbue his notebooks, written in those years, with a dynamism and poignancy which may well in future make him better known as the vivid and unique man he was. Much of his writing was done on the bench outside Cardiff Castle, where, too, he taught hundreds of people about Baha'u'llah. 

 Charles had a bad fall in early 1967 from which he never fully recovered. 

 Yet he was as ardent in faith in his last months as he had ever been, and nine days before his death he arose and went out to attend the wedding of youthful Baha'i friends. 

 He passed quietly in his sleep on Christmas day. His life's story is best told in his own words: "I did at least go and I can assure whoever goes will have rebuffs. But remember this, no one can remeve the footprints you made, or the echo of your voice, or the smiles you gave and those you got in return, and as you go around in your travels, you will see beauty spots, all belonging to God."

        ROY FERNIE                 
  Knight of Baha'u'llah      

 1922 — 1964 Roy Fernie, Knight of Baha'u'llah and first pioneer to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, was the oniy son of Evelyn Granthame-ilayes and Cyril Fernie, owner of the C. Fernie Steamship Company in the Panama Canal Zone. 

 He was born on January20, 1922 at Ancon in the Canal Zone, but spent most of his school years in England with his grandparents. 

 Since Roy was the only son, his father definitely expected him to major in business administration and take aver the reins of the Steamship Company. 

 Accordingly, he sent him to business college in England. But Roy, from childhood on, manifested a tremendous variety of talents, none of them in the least related to the business world. 

 He had an excellent ear for harmony and learned to play both the accordion and piano by ear. He painted, wrote science fiction stories, directed stage plays, and was a superb actor. His abilities were so diverse they seemed to include almost everything but business. But his greatest ambition, he often said, was always to be a doctor. 

 When World War II broke out Roy was only too glad to escape what he considered to be the dull routine of business school and he joined the Royal Air Force. Because of illness he was discharged from the Air Force, but then


<p309>
IN MEMORIAM                309

        Roy Fernie                 

  emigrated to the United States and again entered the Armed Services. When the war ended he became an American citizen and lived for several years in St. Louis, Missouri. 

 By that time Roy's father had retired from active participation in the Steamship Agency, but he constantly kept hope that Roy would take over the business, and eventually, to please his father, Roy returned to the Canal Zone. It was there that he first heard of the Baha'i Faith. He was recuperating from a severe tropical fever at his sister's home in Panama City when he heard her mention a Baha'i girl she had just met. It was late in the evening, and to his sister's consternation he insisted he must meet the "Baha'i girl" immediately. 

 He was so dogged in his determination  that she called the girl and practically begged her to let Roy come over. 

 That same night Roy found himself in the headquarters of the National Spiritual 

Assembly  of Central America

 and the Antilles. The "Baha'i girl" was Elena Maria Marsella, secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly. Roy's family background was Anglican, but he himself had long since ceased to adhere to any "organized religion". 

 With his naturally inquisitive mind he had investigated many faiths but had never found one that seemed sensible or, in his words, "logical". 

 From that point onward Roy's life took a very different turn. He made his declaration in March of 1953; two months later he and Elena were married, and in another three months the newlyweds had answered the call of the Guardian and were settling their affairs and preparing to pioneer in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. 

 For Roy's father this was the last straw. He disinherited his son. This was a great shock to Roy who attached little importance to wealth, because he genuinely wished his father to understand what he called a "hew job that was worth more than a million dollars". 

 After many interesting adventures the Fernies found themselves on Abalang in the Gilbert and Ellice 

Islands. The beloved Guardian 

 had warned them not to teach the Faith but to make friends with the people and win their love. 

 From the first the Gilbertese were fascinated with this tall, lanky American with the brilliant blue eyes, the bubbling personality, the unfailing  sense of humor. He kept them constantly intrigued.  He put on magic shows for them, played the piano, sang with them, learned their language and started English classes for them. Although he could not openly teach the Faith, he actually taught all the principles by example. And before long he had a myriad opportunities to teach that way, for the missionaries began to suspect that the Fernies were not just visiting the Gilbert Islands to study the flora and fauna. 

 Soon they were hinting that the Fernies were a ''dangerous'' couple who were under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Th-vestigation  and Scotland Yard. The Colonial Government, without giving Roy an opportunity  to defend himself, accepted the accusations  as true. 

 Day by day the persecution grew more intense,  but it served oniy to draw the people themselves closer and closer to the Fernies. When finally a Catholic priest saw the word "Baha" on a letter addressed to the "danger-ous  Americans" he proclaimed the Faith for them. He obtained information about it from Australia, then wrote scathing articles in The Star of the Gilberts magazine which went to every island in the atoll. Meanwhile, one Gilbertese had actually declared his acceptance


<p310>
310                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 of the Baha'i Faith. Peter became Roy's constant companion. He could read English and he eagerly devoured every book in the Fernie library. The Guardian, in a letter to him, also told him not to teach his people yet, but to follow the example of the Fernies. 

 With the proclamation of the Faith by the Catholic priest, Roy, and Peter the first Gilbertese Baha, were constantly harassed, both by the missionaries and the heads of the Colonial Government. It was because neither of them displayed any hatred to their malefactors nor retaliated in any way that three hundred and twenty-five Gilbertese affixed their names to a document expressing sympathy with the Faith. 

 But time was short for Roy. First Peter was deported to his own island in the Southern Gilberts, accused of crimes he had never committed. 

 Then Roy was accused of being a divisive  influence, and was deported to Canton Island. 

 And he was alone, for the Acting Resident Commissioner, who favored the Fernies and the Faith, intimated that oniy Roy's name was on the deportation order. 

 For Roy it was truly a tragedy. He loved the Gil-berts  and the Gilbertese people with all his heart; had he not been deported he would have remained all his life in those 

Islands.                  

 He went to Hawaii to be as near as possible to the Gilberts, hoping always that as a result of the Colonial Government's investigation in London and the efforts of the 

British National Spiritual

 Assembly, he would be allowed to return. But it was not to be. He passed on to the Abh~ Kingdom on October 21, 1964, in Honolulu, Hawaii. 

 Before Elena left the Gilberts, after having tried to arrange for Roy's return in Tarawa, a delegation of Catholic "unimane," revered old men, who had served on the Island Council, came to her and said: "We want you to tell Mr. Fernie that we are sorry for what we did. We did not realize he would be deported. 

 We did not intend for things to happen that way. We liked Mr. Fernie and we wish he would came back." 

 The last letter Roy received from Shoghi Effendi, dated October 20, 1957, bore the following postscript in the Guardian's handwriting: "May the Almighty abundantly reward you for your vast, unforgettable and historic services in so remote an area of the globe; to graciously assist you to return to that field and there enrich the record of your splendid and enduring achievements."

    MABEL GRACE ClEARY        
   Knight of Baha'u'llah      

 1888 — 1965 In the Fall of 1937 Grace Geary attended public meetings given at the Brunswick Hotel, Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada, where she heard several lectures given by Mrs. Mabel Ives on the New Revelation of God, the Baha'i Faith. 

 Inspired by what she heard, Grace accepted the invitation of Mrs. Ives to join a study group to learn more of the new teachings. After a period of several weeks' study, Grace and a number of other friends arose to embrace the Baha'i Faith. From that point on Grace expressed her love for Baha'u'llah through courageous and indefatigable service. 

 Through her efforts the Cause of God in the Maritime region of Canada was established on an unassailable  foundation. 

 Early in 1938 Grace became a member of the first 

Spiritual Assemblyin      

 Moncton. The Geary home became a haven for traveling Baha'i teachers, a point of attraction in the entire area. Many visitors from other places were speakers at informal fireside meetings sponsored by Grace — the 

Hands of the Cause Dorothy Baker

 and Siegfried Schopflocher, Mr. Harlan Ober, Mrs. Rosemary Sala, and others. 

 During 1943 Grace joined Mrs. Doris McKay on a teaching trip to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island and in 1944 became a member of the first Local Spiritual Assembly to be established there. Several years later, on the advice of the newly-formed National Spiritual Assembly of Canada, she brought her wisdom to bear in the consultations of the Spiritual Assembly of Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
     While attending the first 

All-America Intercontinental 

 Teaching Conference in Chicago in 1953 the stirring message of the Guardian inspired Grace to offer to pioneer to the unopened  territory of Cape Breton Island at the beginning of the 

Ten Year Spiritual Crusade. For

 this dedicated and sacrificial service she


<p311>

    Mabel Grace Geary         

  was awarded the title of Knight of Baha'u'llah by 

Shoghi Effendi.           

 The difficult years spent in Cape Breton Island were surmounted by her unwavering faith and characteristic courage. Her volunteer services as librarian at the public library in Bacldeck afforded her excellent opportunities to spread the Glad Tidings of Baha'u'llah. 

 Always ready to meet a need in the Cause, she returned to Charlottetown in 1961 to help complete the Spiritual Assembly there. Called finally to the AbliA Kingdom Grace Geary must watch with tender pride and humility the rich harvest now being garnered in luxuriant abundance in the seemingly inhospitable soil of the Maritime region where she was among the first to plant with infinite loving patience the seed of a new truth.

   ELIZABETH G. HOPPER       
   Knight of Baha'u'llah       

 1883 — 1 967 Elizabeth G. Hopper, Knight of Baha'u'llah, died at her pioneer post in Funchal, 

Madeira Islands, on May   

 3, 1967, after fourteen years of dedicated effort for the promotion of the Dah&i Saith in those islands. 

 Miss Hopper was born on April 8, 1883, at flume, 

Allegheny County, New     

 York. She was an ambitious and spirited woman for her period. She completed her Bachelor of Arts degree at Cornell University, and entered the field of library science, serving for some time as senior librarian for an international agency for the United 

States.                   

 Her interest in education and new ideas led her to the Baha'i Faith. 

 She became a Baha'i during the prime of her life, and worked for the Faith with intensity and devotion. 

 She was a member of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha of Washington, D.C. for more than twenty years, serving it as secretary and on local and national Baha'i committees involved with teaching and publication. 

 Fragile in appearance, gentle in manner and yet possessed of tremendous will and a capacity for generosity and deep loyalty to the Faith and the friends she loved, Elizabeth entered the pioneering service during her late years. After years of service in her professional field, she had retired (in 1952) secure and established in her comfortable apartment in Washington, D.C. However, in 1953 the stirring appeals of the beloved Guardian for pioneers to take the Faith to the virgin areas of the world had become increasingly urgent, and were directed to the friends of all ages and backgrounds. In the sensitive heart of Elizabeth Hopper there was an irresistible prompting that bade her arise and respond to the Guardian's appeal. Although she was entering her seventies she heeded this inner call and changed the whole course of her life. 

 She offered to go as a pioneer settler to the virgin area of the Madeira Islands. Such was her determination that by September of 1953 she had given up her apartment, packed her belongings and set forth for her goal. Joining  her in this pioneer venture was another, younger Baha'i, Miss Ada Schott, who volunteered  to go so that Madeira would have a pioneer team to teach the Faith and establish a new community. 

 On September 20, 1953, Elizabeth and Ada landed in Funchal, Madeira's chief port and city, and cabled the news of their arrival. Their names were added to the World Crusade map and they were assured that they brought joy to the beloved Guardian, to the National As-w w

 sembly of the United States and to the Mrica Committee which supervised the pioneering efforts in the islands off the coast of Africa. The early months of that first year were mercifully pleasant for the two pioneers. They made friends and were courteously received and assisted by the people and the officials of that charming island. 

 By 1956 after three years of ardent prayer, patiently cultivated contacts and innumerable firesides, they were at last able to report the declaration of three new Baha'is in Funchal. The joy of this hard-won achievement brought new problems. 

 They were required to leave the island temporarily before their permanent residence visas could be obtained. 

 Then personal  circumstances made it necessary for Miss Schott to return to the United States. 

 This meant that Elizabeth was alone. She was seventy-six years of age at that time, feeling the inevitable handicaps of age, subject to bouts of discouragement, and yet impelled to continue the work of deepening, strengthening and teaching new believers and contacts. She appealed for help from additional settlers and through visitors from the accessible Baha'i communities. 

 There was an encouraging trickle of visitors who came and stayed for a time and added much happiness and help though their presence. She mentioned them all so lovingly: Mrs. Sara Kenney and her mother, Mrs. Ella Duffield, Mrs. Peggy True, Miss Trudy Eisenberg, 

Miss Katherine Meyer, Miss 

 Elsie Austin, Mr. and Mrs. Valine from the Canaries, Mrs. Elizabeth Stamp, Mr. Missaghieb, and others. 

 The friends tried to help by writing to her of tourists and visitors they knew who would come to the island, but to her great dismay no permanent settler could be found to come and stay. 

 During the period from 1956 to 1961 when Elizabeth was the only resident pioneer, her letters and reports to the United 

States Mrica Committee     

 unfold a moving account of the problems and situations which many pioneers must face. They are worthy of mention and reflection since we who view the pioneers at a distance may sometimes miss the significance and impact of the challenges they encounter. When the progress of the teaching work is slow and the area inhospitable, the pioneer must constantly struggle against discouragement and loneliness. Elizabeth fought this battle alone. 

Elizabeth G. Hopper        

 There was also the constant strain of cornmuni-cation in a language which she could not master. There were the subtle barriers with which cultural differences can impair understanding and confidence. Elizabeth grieved deeply over the "spiritual dropouts" she encountered when she had worked so hard to give a redeeming message. 

 She also had to deal with the conflict and confusion which can result from situations where actions and attitudes of the believers fail to uphold the moral standards and spiritual responsibilities of the Baha'i Faith. 

 Only once, during this lonely period, did Elizabeth look back in anguish. 

 In a letter to a dear friend she wrote of her loneliness and despair and wondered whether another place might have yielded better results. 

 But in the same letter her strength of spirit was expressed for she corrected herself, writing,".. 

 and then I have to remember that Madeira is in the Divine Plan and the Guardian wanted an Assembly there." 

 In this period of tests two of her most wonderful Baha'i experiences occurred. 

 She attended the Most Great Jubilee in London and also received permission to go on a pilgrimage to the Jloiy Land. How happy these two confirming experiences made her and how much she learned from seeing the devotion of the friends who serve at the World Center.

IN MEMORIAM                 313
     In 1961 a new BahA'ipioneer
arrived to spend six months.

 Elizabeth warmly welcomed and praised Mr. Joseph Kubik who came and helped with the Baha'i community responsibilities.  Then came a new Baha'i family from the Canaries. There was great happiness and activity for several months, and then again Elizabeth was alone. 

 In 1963, at the age of eighty, Elizabeth, still alone and with her hearing growing steadily worse, was urged by friends to return to the United States. She bad the courage to reply, "No, dears, I do not want to come back regardless  of how difficult things are becoming." Her greatest solace was reflection on the beloved Guardian's appreciation of steadfastness in the believers, and how reluctant he was to remove from his Crusade map the name of an area shown as settled. She knew that Madeira would always have a Baha identification if she remained and persevered in that difficult pioneer post. 
    Great happiness came to    

Elizabeth in 1964. She     

 felt near the end of her time. A Baha'i came to be with her, Mrs. Isabel Horton, who stayed with her until her end, giving her the assurance she needed that her lifelong accumulation of Baha'i literature and archives materials would be safely preserved. She passed away serene in the knowledge that she had been faithful to her pioneer trust, and that her weary body would rest in that island she had chosen. Elizabeth must have met that radiant "Messenger of Joy" confident of the promise of Baha'u'llah: "They that have forsaken their country for the purpose of teaching Our Cause — these shall the Faithful Spirit strengthen through its power. 

 By MyLife!No act, however great, ean compare with it, except such deeds as have been ordained by God, the All-Powerful, the Most Mighty. Such a service is, indeed, the prince of all goodly deeds, and the ornament of every goodly act." 

  Madeira is indeed illumined by the memory of this loyal pioneer. The Universal House of Justice in recognition of her self-sacrifice cabled the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 

States on May 5, 1967:

CATHERINE HEWARD HUXTARLE  
                           
  Knight of Baha'u'llah      

 1932 — 1967 The young people listened attentively as Clifford Huxtable answered their question about how he had met his remarkable wife. "I first met Catherine at a dance at the University of Toronto. I had never seen such a beautiful girl. 

 I was halfway across the room to ask her to be my partner before I realized that she was seated in a wheelchair. Instead of my dancing partner, she became my wife." 

 Catherine iluxtable was born in England on January 6, 1932. Upon her family's return to Canada she entered Havergal College at the age of seven. Following an almost fatal attack of scarlet fever in her tenth year it was discovered that she suffered from muscular dystrophy of a rare type which indicated a rapid decline and a greatly shortened life span which would probably  not reach twenty years. She was to be confined to a wheelchair for half her life. At sixteen her worsening condition made it impossible  to continue formal schooling. 

 Despite her physical limitations and waning strength Catherine developed into a self-reliant young woman of diversified interests. She attracted to her a widening circle of friends who accompanied her to concerts, ballets, theatres, art galleries, lectures. She became a gifted writer and an accomplished artist in needlepoint. In 1951 she and Clifford Huxtable, by then one of her determined suitors, embraced the Baha'i Faith; in 1955 they were married. 

 Catherine served on the Spiritual Assembly of Toronto with dedication and became an extremely effective and informed speaker. She had an unusual capacity for sharing the insights  gathered from her intensive study of the Teachings. The intimate "fireside" meetings in her home with Catherine presiding as gracious hostess were a source of confirmation to many; cynicism, doubt and the qualified acceptance of the power of God receded in her presence, so marvellously did she exemplify the Message she presented. 

 A friend records: "The overpowering combination of Cathy's serenity and saintliness of spirit, her nobility and radiance of character, and the sheer beauty of her physical person — a beauty at one time curiously both regal and winsome — served to almost blind one to her

  great humanness. Only after being with her did one reflect: she is a truly splendid human being, total and balanced and genuine. She lived to an unusual degree in a condition of consciousness of the presence of God, equally committed to the victory of the spirit and to the joy of a full human life. Perhaps this balance was the source of her power and tranquillity. 

 She seemed always to be simultaneously static and meditative, engaged in some higher communion, and soaring in an authoritative, graceful motion that the eye could hardly trace. 

 Wherever  she went she was described as a saint, a heroine and a true Baha. 

 She was perhaps never more saintly than when withstanding our fusty, needless solicitousness, the limitations we sought to impose on her Baha service, our unconscious projection on her of both our hidden doubts about the assistance promised in the Cause and our desire to see fulfilled in her existence our own deepest spiritual aspirations; nor was she more heroic than when accosted by our need for vindication of the power of the Faith to raise a saint in our midst; nor more a true Baha'i than when yielding to our efforts to come to her assistance xbith an empty cup, only to withdraw from her strengthened, renewed and with cup overflowing. 

 "One cannot imagine the countless subtle hurts and humiliations that arose from her physical condition nor measure the will she applied to overcoming them. Once I found her weeping in a brief and rare surrender to self-pity and rejection. 

 Her child had run to her for comfort and brushing the cold steel of her chair had turned away baffled and accepted solace from the housekeeper. Catherine asked for five minutes in which to pray and regain her composure, then invited me to introduce the friend I had brought to meet her. My companion, a cynical, pragmatic businessman emerged from his meeting with Catherine with an altered attitude, a confirming experience which led him into the Faith. 

 'What an incredible  power that woman has!' he commented. 

 'She tells me that there is a God, and I believe her. Furthermore I suspect that Catherine Huxtable must be one of God's favourite teddybears!"' The sensitive observer noting Catherine's special love for the pioneers and her frequent letters to those serving in distant areas would have known that inevitably she would pioneer. The passing of the Guardian whom she loved wholeheartedly crystallized her intention; in response, the Huxtables pioneered to Regina, Saskatchewan, to assist in rebuilding the Spiritual Assembly in 1957. That task successfully accomplished, a more distant and less hospitable goal was selected still farther removed  from their home base and offering fewer amenities and comforts. 

 The Jiuxtables founded the first Spiritual Assembly in the Gulf Islands, a virgin territory of the Ten Year Crusade. By this sacrificial service they joined the ranks of the 

Knights of Baha'u'llah.   

 In this remote outpost in the North Pacific Ocean, in 1962, as though in reward for this devoted service, Catherine bore a child, Gavin. Her happiness was complete. 

 When the call for pioneers in the Nine Year Plan was raised in 1965, again the hearts of Catherine and Clifford Huxtable were touched. They vohmteered to settle on the lonely volcanic island of St. Helena, final prison and restingplace of Napoleon Bonaparte. 

 Catherine confided to a friend on the eve of her departure for Africa: "I don't aspire to be a saint; I would rather be one of God's teddybears. 

 I am really no different from anyone else. It is just that I know I shall have less time than others; I cannot be like the unwary bird Baha'u'llah speaks of in The Hidden Words, Only by

 centering myself in the Covenant of God can my life or death have any significance. If I have a private prayer, it's this: Let my life and death count in the Faith!" 

 On October 25, 1967, just nineteen months after arriving at St. Helena, Catherine passed away. "The end came suddenly after only one day of discomfort," Clifford wrote. "Her last words were an earnest but not anguished prayer, 'I want to die."' The frail vessel which contained her triumphant spirit rests in the bosom of a soft green hill high in the centre of St. Helena looking out to the South Atlantic. From the uncertain and circumscribed fabric of her brief life Catherine fashioned a cloak of immortality, hers to wear through all the worlds of God. As she draws closer to His Throne of Glory, assuredly she is dancing.

 of Baha'u'llah 1900 — 1964 Alyce Janssen answered the call of the beloved Guardian to pioneer during the Ten Year Crusade and as a result of settling in Spanish Morocco joined the ranks of the Knights of 

Baha'u'llah.               

 To capture a picture of Alyce one would visualize neatly bobbed graying brown hair, sparkling blue-gray eyes, a small stature and an enchanting smile. 

 Deeply spiritual in nature and vivacious and loving in personality, her warm appeal and genuine concern for the rights and equalities of all races attracted manyresponsive souls who became confirmed in the 

Cause of Baha'u'llah.      

 Although handicapped by age and poor health Alyce successfully pioneered in several foreign lands including Switzerland, Italy and the Canary Islands. 

 As part of an interracial party of five crusaders, she assisted in establishing the Faith in Ceuta, Spanish Morocco. The writer of this memoir, whose family together with Alyce and others composed that pioneer team, recalls with profound tenderness the feeling of oneness, the mutual sharing of resources  both tangible and intangible, that marked every step of what might otherwise 

 Alyce Barbara May Janssen  

  have been a harrowing and distressing experience: the bedsprings without mattresses, the leaks in the ceilings, the unwanted lice, the bugs in the flour. 

 These physical inconveniences intensified our fervor and increased our dedication  to the goal we had set out to accomplish. The courage, understanding,love and fortitude that characterized the spirit of our dearly-loved spiritual sister, Alyce, as we met each new hardship,  was a splendid example and a source of great inspiration to us all. 

 Alyce ended her days on earth in Santa Rosa, California, on December 10, 1964, mourned by her family and a wide circle of friends whose lives she touched: the sad of heart for whom she performed countless deeds of kindness, the discouraged and disillusioned to whom she offered words of comfort, the little bands of Arab and Spanish children who clustered around to hear her beautiful stories related in her special brand of broken Spanish, and those to whom she so generously gave of her material goods. Our sadness at our loss is sweetened by the certain knowledge that Alyce has won an everlasting crown.

316                 THE BAHA'I WORLD
       MALCOLM KING               
   Knight of Baha'u'llah       

 1885(?)'1966 Dr. Malcolm King made his declaration of faith as a Baha'i in March 1931 and such was his capacity that he was elected as a member of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on April 20, 1931. He served with distinction on the Milwaukee Spiritual Assembly for nine years during which time he stressed that the Baha'is must ever be on the alert, seeking, planning, consulting and praying that they might be illumined with the glorious and effulgent light of the Hoiy Spirit and that Baha'u'llah would guide and direct them so that they could blaze a new path and unfold new vistas of social, spiritual orientation for the American Baha'i con~imunities and hasten the realization of the Kingdom of the Most Great Peace. Dr. King left Milwaukee to pioneer in the First Seven Year Plan set forth by the beloved Guardian (1937 — 19~). 

 He remained  a pioneer for the rest of his life, serving also in the Second Seven Year Plan, the World Crusade and even in the Nine Year Plan. 

 This stalwart pioneer concentrated his efforts on the Caribbean area. He taught the Faith of Baha'u'llah in Nicaragua, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Antigua, 

British Guiana and Jamaica.

 The Guardian appointed him a Knight of Baha'u'llah in October 1953 when he set out for British Guiana at the beginning of the World Crusade. 

     In Nicaragua Dr. King      

 worked diligently toward the establishment of a Spiritual Assembly. 

 Much time and effort were necessary in order to obtain official approval for holding public meetings and publicizing the Cause in that country. A statement of the aims and principles of the Faith was placed in the government records. 

 This delicate situation was handled with tact and patience by him. Weekly study classes were organized which interested and attracted all classes of people. Regular weekly broadcasts were given over a radio station that was heard throughout Central 

America.                   

 Later Dr. King settled in Haiti to teach for an indefinite period of time. He held meetings three times a week and worked to enable the Spiritual Assembly to become strong, virile and functioning. 

 He worked diligently to have the 

       Malcolm King               

  Faith registered in that country. While in Haiti Dr. King traveled to Santiago, Dominican  Republic, to start a regional project there. He then went to Kingston, Jamaica, to help work out an extension project before returning to 

Haiti.                     
    As a pioneer Dr. King      

 frequently felt the frustration of a foreigner in a strange country who does not speak the native language. 

 He feared that it would affect his teaching for he firmly believed that a professional interpreter lacked the motive to impart the spirit of the Faith in his translations. 

 Yet Dr. King's sincerity and great faith must have reached his listeners because he left behind him in each of his pioneering posts many believers and many assemblies which remained strong, active and pulsating with life. 

 Dr. King was distinguished for his knowledge of the Sacred Writings, many of which he could quote verbatim. He was an outstanding Bible scholar and so could relate his teaching work to the background of his listeners. He firmly believed in expansion and consolidation taking place simultaneously. 

 He followed all his lectures by a series of classes which were well attended. 

 He was an advocate of a direct

  type of teaching for he stressed the importance and significance of this age, that Baha'u'llah is a Manifestation of God, that this is the Day of God and that Baha'u'llah has come to establish the Kingdom of God, and the Most Great Peace. 

 In 1961 Jamaica became his last pioneering post. He was inspired, despite his advancing years, by the spiritual and dynamic power of the 

Teachings of Baha'u'llah     

 to the end of his life. Knight of Baha'u'llah Malcolm King, having served Baha'u'llah for more than thirty years, twenty of them as a pioneer in foreign lands, passed to the AbbA Kingdom in Jamaica at approximately eighty-one years of age on October 19, 1966. 
                             
      RICHARD H. NOLEN             
    Knight of Baha'u'llah        

 1914 — 1964 Richard H. Nolen was born in Almont, Michigan, March 14, 1914. At the age of five he contracted rheumatic fever which left him with a defective heart and curtailed his physical activity all his life. Compelled to seek quiet pursuits he developed a deep love of good music and a burning thirst for spiritual truth. As a young man he composed and arranged orchestral music and played in local orchestras. He investigated religion. In 1948, through an advertisement in the area newspaper, he learned of the Baha Faith and met 

Kenneth and Roberta Christian

 in Lansing, Michigan. His search was ended. He immediately accepted the Baha'i Cause and it became the dominating passion of his life. He participated in local, state and national activities and was a tireless, humble and successful teacher. 

 Responding to the call of the beloved Guardian  for pioneers to arise in the Ten Year Crusade, Mr. Nolen and his family immediately volunteered to go to a virgin territory. 

 It was suggested by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States that he go to the Mores Islands where the climate is mild. He resigned his job as a draftsman, disposed of his home and household furnishings, and with his wife and three children boarded a freighter which brought them to the Azores on October 8, 1953. For this sacrificial action, Mr. and Mrs. 317 

Richard H. Nolen             

 Nolen were designated Knights of Baha'u'llah by Shoghi 

Effendi.                     

 After a period of physical hardship, and handicapped in his search for employment because of lack of knowledge of the Portuguese language, Mr. Nolen found work with a building  contractor at a United States air base and later he was employed by the United States Government as a draftsman at Lajes Air Force base on Terceira Island. Life became considerably easier. Mr. Nolen applied himself diligently to a study of the Portuguese language in order to equip himself to teach the Faith. He traveled to all nine islands in the group, teaching,  presenting literature and raising the cry "YA Bah&u'1-Abh&' and in addition he also made several trips to meet the Baha'is of Portugal and Germany. 

 At RiQvAn 1958, the first Spiritual Assembly was formed on Terceira Island but it was not until December of that year that the first two native believers embraced the Faith. This was a time of great rejoicing and the Faith continued to grow slowly but steadily. By 1961 the local religious authorities grew concerned. The International 

Police summoned Mr. Nolen    

 and advised him that he must discontinue teaching the Faith or leave the islands. 
Despite these

  this point of no return where the outworn vessel rests. 

 obstacles the Spiritual Assembly continued to meet and study classes were held in Baha'i homes. 

 A functioning body of believers was left in the Azores when Mr. Nolen's failing health led to his reluctant decision, in 1962, to return to the United States. 

  Two more children had been born to the Nolens in the Azores, and although the eldest daughter had matured and returned to America earlier, there was still a family of six who settled in Tacoma, 

Washington, in August      

 1962 and enjoyed the sorely-missed activities of Baha'i schools, institutes and conventions. 

 Mr. Nolen now enjoyed the bounty of unfettered teaching of the Faith he loved. 

 After a prolonged illness which confined him to hospital, Richard Nolen was called to join the Concourse on high on May 5, 1964. 

 In tribute to Richard Nolen, the following poem was written by Preble 

(Hazel) Mon:               

  Ring of faith is on his finger, and nine fragrant heart's red roses at his feet; enwrapped in purest white silken lining, the memoried chalice that housed this Knight. 

  Ennobled is this glen where rain-washed sun sifts through trees lifting  their welcoming leaves to the muted harmonies of two worlds mingled here and now under these boughs. 

  I yield Thee thanks that Thou hast allowed Thy servant to find greater realms of Thine, and claimed in Thine own Name

  1882 — 1965 Mr. RafPi was born in 1882 in KirmAn, a small town in the southeastern province of IrAn. He embraced the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah       

 at the age of

  thirty and became one of its courageous, kind and generous servants. He was always re4dy to assist anyone in need and was constant in his support of Baha funds. When difficulties arose for the Baha'is in the backward and fanatical community of RafsanjAn, as they often did, he was a staunch, fearless and effective defender of the Cause. 

 After years of continuous and devoted service, he received permission in 1952 to make his pilgrimage with his family. The following

IN MEMORIAM                 319
year he attended all four  

InterContinental Conferences

 including that held in New Delhi from where, in response to the call for pioneers to open unsettled territories, he went immediately  to Tangier, Morocco, a goal of the 

Ten Year Crusade. For      

 this action his name was recorded as one of the Knights of Baha'u'llah. He arrived at his goal in October 1953 and established himself in the International Zone. When problems were encountered in obtaining residence permits, he promptly secured the services of two lawyers and after two months of persistent effort he succeeded in dissipating all misunderstandings on the part of the officials regarding the intentions of the Baha'is, following  which the necessary visas were granted for himself and other pioneers. 

 He participated in the formation of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Tangier. Later he moved successively to Rabat to complete the Assembly, and to Larache to open that goal area and assist in the formation of its Assembly. He remained there in spite of his delicate health and the inclement climate and was widely known for his hospitality, outstanding kindness and his simple and cordial manners. 

 When persecution of the Baha'is broke out in Na~1or he was advised to settle in a larger city. 

 He moved first to Rabat and then to Meknes. His ardent desire to be of service led him to establish residence not in the city but in the suburbs of Meknes in order to attempt to establish a new centre. He died there on June27, 1965, leaving behind children and grandchildren who continue to follow his example of consecrated service. 

 It is impossible to correctly appraise the contribution of an individual to the success of a collective endeavour. Nevertheless, all who had the privilege of knowing Mr. Rafi'i are unanimous  in their belief that his exemplary spiritual and material contributions had great impact in the achievements of Baha'i communities in North West Mrica. 
                           
    FRANCISCO PIMIENTA ARPUSHANA
   First Guajiro Martyr

Francisco Pimienta Arpushana

 was an Indian of the Guaj Ira area of Colombia. 

The Guajiros               

 are a seminomadic tribe composed of large castes or clans. Theirs is a relatively lawless life as they have no central authority nor do they turn to the government in settling problems arising from relationships among themselves. 

 Francisco was considered the chief of the Arpushana clan and wielded considerable authority and influence among his people. He embraced the 

Baha'i Faith in April      

 1964 and was distinguished from the cultural pattern of the area by his constant efforts to create peaceful relationships among the various castes, attempting to persuade them to seek unity in the Teachings of Dah&u'llah and abandon ancient feuds and blood revenge. 

 Through his teaching efforts and the example of his life, many Guajiros embraced the Faith. He accompanied the Baha'i pioneers on teaching trips and translated into the Guajiro language a number of Baha'i prayers. 

 For a long time the clan headed by Francisco had been engaged in a feud with another caste and a number of deaths had occurred on both sides. 

 The unresolved quarrel continued to rankle and outbreaks of hostility threatened to lead to more deaths. Francisco sought to bring about a permanent peace by arranging to meet with the chief of the other clan. Hopeful of reaching a peaceful agreement, Francisco accompanied by his seven-year-old son and an older male relative set out for the meeting by bus on April 15, 1966. En route to their destination the vehicle was ambushed. 

 Francisco  was killed by members of the enemy clan and his companion was injured. The child escaped unharmed. Although urged by his relative to use his pistol in self-defense and not to "die like a woman", Francisco refused to resort to violence. 

 One report indicated that eighteen bullets riddled his body. 

 Gathering with members of his family at his burial site, the Baha'i pioneers were addressed by an uncle of Francisco who later accepted the Faith: "Yes, of course, you have a complete right to be here. 

 Francisco was one of you, a Baha'i." 

 One day his son who witnessed the senseless slaying will perhaps understand how well his father lived and how gallantly he died.

320                THE BAHA'I WORLD
       EF14E BAKER               
March 25, 1880 — January    

 1, 1968  

Shortly before John Henry 
Hyde Dunn and Clara Dunn  

 left Sydney for Victoria late in 1922, Effie Baker had become disenchanted with the church. She and Miss Ruby Beaver were on the welcoming committee and were charged with the responsibility of arranging for speakers for the New Thought organization when 

Hyde Dunn visited Melbourne.

 One evening Effie noticed a benign looking whitehaired gentleman in the audience and made a note of intention to request him to come as a speaker for their group. The next meeting Effie was late in arriving and saw that the notice board in the vestibule stated that Mr. Hyde Dunn would be speaking on the Baha'i Faith. And so it was that Effie first heard of the Faith and accepted it that night. Miss Baker thus became the first woman believer in Australia. The first man to accept the Faith, Mr. 0. Whitaker, had accepted earlier in the year in Lismore, 

New South Wales.          

 Effie's first activities were in accompanying the Dunns on their subsequent visits to other States; she also attended Martha Root on Martha's first lecture tour which took her to New Zealand where she met Mrs. and Miss F. Blundell and Mrs. Margaret 

Stevenson, New Zealand's  
fir~t believers. The      

Baha'is of New Zealand    

 were planning a trip to the Holy Land and Martha suggested that Effie join the party. Effie then sold her home and left with the first pilgrims from the Antipodes. The party was made up of Effic, Miss M. Stevenson, Mrs. Blundell, Ethel and Hugh Blundell, though Hugh had not then accepted the Faith. They left Melbourne on Tuesday, February 10, 1925. 

 The party arrived in Haifa on March 13 where they were met at the train by Fujita who took them to the Western Pilgrim House where they were welcomed by Mrs. Corinne True. Shoghi Effendi asked them to see him before lunch. 

 Effie described this as a wonderful interview. 

 The party visited the Shrines the next day and then met with the Greatest 

Hoiy Leaf, whom Effie     

 eulogized. The group spent nineteen  days in the Holy Land and then proceeded to London for three months. Effie accompanied the others on the Guardian's instructions to visit the friends there and then return to Australia and work with the Dunns. 
The ladies                

       Eflie Baker               

  of the household of the 

Holy Family asked Effie   

 to stop over at Haifa on her return journey to 

Australia.                

 Having spent three busy months in England Effie returned to Haifa in June and found that Mirza JinAb-i-EAJiI, returning with his family to Persia from a lecture tour in America, had fallen ill while visiting Haifa, as had Fujita also, so Effie looked after them and the ladies of the household asked Effle to remain until Shoghi Effendi returned to the Holy Land. 

 When the Guardian came back to Haifa and took her to Babji, Effie offered her services to him in 

Haifa, but Shoghi Effendi 

 said she was to return to Australia. The next day the Guardian told Effie he had reconsidered her offer to remain in Haifa, and thus began Effie's eleven years of service at the World 

Centre.                   

 Besides carrying out the myriad tasks of hostess at the World Centre, Effie, being a photographer and an extremely artistic and talented craftswoman, was able to assist the Guardian by photographing events and places in Haifa. About 1930, when the need became apparent for the securing of photographs of historical places in Persia, it was decided by the


<p321>
IN MEMORIAM                321

 Guardian that Effie should travel there and take them. 

 To travel from Haifa to Persia by automobile across Syria and 'Iraq, in territory where bandits were common, was Effie's introduction  to an arduous but interesting and fruitful episode in her period of direct service to the Guardian. In all but a few places where it was too dangerous for a westerner to go, Effie photographed sites of 

Baha'i interest. Most     

 of the trip was accomplished by automobile  supplied by the Persian believers, but at times it was necessary to travel on horseback, or sometimes by donkey or mule. On one of these occasions while on a mountain track, steep and dark, she fell and injured her collarbone, but continued the journey. 

 A selection of the photographs taken by Effie during this period have been immortalized by their being selected by the Guardian for inclusion in The Dawn-Breakers. 

 In 1937 Effie returned to Australia. For a time she stayed in Sydney and then spent several years in her parent's home in Golds-borough, Victoria. The last years of her life were spent at the national tla4ratu'1-Quds where she lived at the invitation of the National Spiritual Assembly, from time to time visiting the friends in other States. 

 Effie's loyalty to the Guardian was absolute. Her dignity, humour and quiet unassuming manner made her a treasured companion of the friends. She had kept a day-by-day account of her Persian journey, but her modesty and humility were such that it was with some difficulty that she was finally persuaded to send a copy of her journal to the 

Universal House of Justice.

 Effie lived a true and exemplary Baha'i life, helpful, loving and affectionate and ever encouraging those who sought to arise to serve the Cause she loved so well. 

 In a letter addressed to Miss Baker on August 27, 1951, the secretary of the Guardian wrote: 

"Often Shoghi Effendi     

 remarks that if you were in Haifa, you would take some wonderful photos. 

 He considers that no one has ever captured the beauty of the place as you did, and your photographs adorn his own rooms, and the archives and the Mansion, just as they did when you were with us!" 

 A postscript to this letter, in the handwriting of Shoghi EfTendi, states: "Assuring you of my deep appreciation of your unforgettable services at the World Centre of our beloved Faith, and of my prayers for the success of every effort you exert for its promotion." 

 Death came to Effie gently, on January II, 1968. She was laid to rest in Mona Vale Cemetery beneath weeping skies, mourned by a wide circle of friends. 

JAMES HEGGIE              
                          
    FRANK ALBERT BAKER        

 1889 — 1963 Frank Albert Baker was barn on November 21, 1889, in Zanesville, Ohio. 

 German was still the family language, and he spoke no English until he started school. When he was a small boy 

    Frank Albert Baker        

  Frank would sometimes stand at his window at night, thinking about the Bible prophecies concerning the time of the end. 

 He felt that he might well be living in that time, and that perhaps during his lifetime Christ would return. Years later, when he told his father about the Baha'i Faith, his father replied that while he was too old to change he thought that this message was true, and he felt privileged to know of it while still in this world.


<p322>
322                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 •    When Frank was in his second year at Yale University he met Mary Stoltzenbach, and after a whirlwind romance they were married. 

 His family knew his bride and were delighted with his choice. He went to work in his father's bakery, where he stayed for seven years until Mary died of pneumonia. He then left Zanes-yule  with his two children, Conrad and Sarah, and became manager of the National Biscuit Company bread bakeries. 

 In the autumn of 1920 he met Dorothy Beecher, a young grammar school teacher, in Montclair, New Jersey, at the boarding house where she lived and he and his children usually ate dinner. They were married the following June and their first child, Winifred Louise, was born in May, 1922. Soon after her birth they moved to Buffalo, New York, where their second child, William King, was born. It was in Buffalo that they became actively involved in Baha'i teaching. When Dorothy first told Frank about the Faith, before their marriage, he was very receptive and felt that it was probably  true. 

 In those days new believers did not register, and he simply grew closer and closer to the Faith, gradually moving from his Lutheran past into active Baha'i participation. 

 When his daughter Sarah was almost thirteen Dorothy took her to hear Dr. Ali-Kuli Khan speak on 

The Seven Valleys. Sarah  

 was so deeply moved that she wept through it all. 

 That same night she told Dorothy, "Muzz, whatever happens, I want you to know that I am a Baha." It was only a few weeks later that she died of leukemia. 

 Two years after Sarah's death Frank established his own wholesale bakery in Lima, Ohio. At Dorothy's request they bought a centrally located house, with a large, frosted, old-English "B" on the glass front door which eventually came to stand for "Baha'i" when the house became the local Baha'i centre, which it still is today. 

 During their second year in Lima Frank was approached by a group of people who were studying comparative religion. They said, "Frank, you and your wife have something that we don't have. What is it?" He told them that they had indeed, but that he could not explain it as well as Dorothy could. They arranged an evening when she would tell them about the Baha'i Faith. The fourteen members of the group all came on a Tuesday, and those weekly gatherings were continued throughout that season. 

 It was Dorothy's first sustained, independent teaching, and she spent twenty to forty hours every week preparing the one hour class. The following April all fourteen members of the group accepted the Faith, and the first Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Lima. When the community began to grow, a number of ministers attacked the Faith from their pulpits. Frank's business was badly hurt, to the point that he was not at all sure that it would survive. The local Baha activity, which was largely centered in his home, increased dramatically  in response to the attack. It was primarily though his efforts that the community got free time on the new local radio station. With a public forum available, the attacks quickly subsided. 

 From that time until he left Lima to pioneer in 

Grenada, British West     

 Indies, sometwenty-five years later, Frank served uninterruptedly as treasurer of the Lima Spiritual Assembly and was frequently a delegate to the National Convention.  He contributed constantly, both directly and indirectly, to the life of the local, national and finally the international Baha'i community, 'primarily in nonverbal ways. When his son Bill was eight or nine years old he told him, "You know, your mother may well go down in history as a prominent BahA'L"1 He had a constant and profound appreciation of her work, and gave her unflagging moral support and encouragement as well as full financial backing. It was not only to Dorothy that he extended such support. Many pioneers could not have gone out without his help. He also took Baha'u'llah's teachings on the importance  of education very much to heart and helped several young people to go on to higher education. 

 All four of Frank's children became Baha'is, and two of them have been pioneers. 

 Conrad, Frank's oldest son, died in 1948, but Conrad's son, Dwight, has continued to give dedicated service to the 

Faith.                    

 In 1954 Frank and Dorothy, with Dorothy's mother, "Aunty Lou" fleecier, planned to pioneer in 

Grenada. By then Frank    

 had sold his bakery and retired. He and Aunty Lou were en route to meet Dorothy in Trinidad when the tragic news came of her death, when the air-'Dorothy thy B. Baker was appointed a Hand of' the Cause by Shoghi Effendi on24 December 1951. See The Baha'i World, vol. XII, p. 670.

 plane in which she was returning to the United States from a teaching tour in India exploded and crashed into the Tyrrhenian Sea. They returned briefly to Lima, and from there went to Italy, with Frank's two surviving children, Bill and Louise, for her funeral at sea near the island of Elba. At the Guardian's invitation he and Aunty Lou went on to Haifa. 

 This was Frank's oniy pilgrimage to the World Centre. The following year they proceeded with their plans and went to Grenada where Frank bought a home which he opened to the Faith and where he supported pioneers to help in establishing the Cause in towns and villages throughout the island. 

 Grenada and Lima continued to be his two bases until his death in June 1963 in Lima, shortly after his return from Grenada. 

 Frank was so generous, gregarious, relaxed and sympathetic that he fitted into almost any group and was at ease, and put others at ease, in almost any situation. He was totally faithful to his friends and wholly constant in his affections.  Even though he knew deep suffering during his lifetime, he remained outgoing and responsive to the needs of others. 

 He was grateful for the faith that sustained him and no matter what sorrow visited him he turned always to plans for the future. He taught by the example of his life more than by his words, and while his acts of kindness were performed without  fanfare, and indeed often almost secretly, he is known, loved and remembered for the fruits of his deeds. 

 Following his passing on June 10, 1963, the Hands of the Cause of God in the Holy Land cabled:

  STANLEY WILLIAM BOLTON    

  1892 — 1966 So often when one looks back over a human life, one is astounded by the small coincidences which appear to have influenced that life. A 

  Stanley William Bolton    

  chance remark, a teacher, or someone met over a meal are seen, later, as special threads in the fabric of human experience, giving colour and beauty to the finished design. 

 And when those special incidents are added by the touch of the Master's hand they are especially significant. I see such coincidences in the life of the late Staxiley William Bolton, whose deep love for Baha'u'llah is still felt by those who knew him best. 

 Late last century, in Canada, a young man, Hansford 

Bolton, married Mary      

 F. Linton who, on March 24, 1892, brought forth a son whom she named Stanley William. At the time the parents were living on the Second Line North Adelaide Township and young Stanley was sent to the Crathie School, on No. 81 highway. Here he came under the instruction of Mr. Eli Oliver. Did this Eli, I wonder, like Eli of the Book of Samuel, arouse in the young boy a listening ear to the call of God? 

 When he was thirteen years of age, Stanley Bolton left the influence of Eli Oliver and went with his parents to live at Strathroy, Ontario. While there he attended Stratliroy Collegiate on High and Princess Streets and displayed an aptitude for mathematics.

324                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 At the outbreak of World War I, Stanley joined the Canadian Armed Forces and served in France where he was wounded. On returning to civilian life, he joined the Fuller Brush Company and about three years later was transferred to Winnipeg, Manitoba. 

 Here in the spring of 1922 lie met and fell in love with Mariette Germaine Roy, an attractive girl from Quebec. Twelve months later they were married and, shortly afterwards, Stanley's company asked him to go to Australia as their representative. 

 They sailed on the old Makura, berthing in Sydney on September 24, 1924. 

 Stanley at once set about establishing the Fuller Brush Company  in his adopted country. During the next ten years he saw much of Australia, visiting each of the various 

States.                   

 Not long after their arrival in Sydney they were befriended by Dr. Coxon and his wife. This again seems to be the touch of the Master's hand, for one day the Coxons invited them to lunch. As Stanley and his wife walked up the path to the house, they saw their host on the balcony. With him was a striking looking whitehaired gentleman. Drawing closer they noticed the visitor wpre a lumberjack shirt having banded cuffs buttoned at the wrist. Mound his waist he wore a cummerbund and at his neck a bow tie. The two men left the balcony and walked down the path towards them. 

 They met on the path, Stanley and his wife making their first acquaintance with John Henry Hyde Dunn, the Baha pioneer to Australia. 

 Over luncheon, Mr. Dunn told them of the Baha'i Faith, a world religion. 

 He spoke of a universal language; he quoted Baha'u'llah's Words. 

 A deep spiritual curiosity was aroused in Stanley Bolton and his wife. 

 They became eager to know more of this amazing new revelation from God. 

 In the ensuing years, Stanley ]3olton en-deavoured to consolidate his business, while at the same time deepening his understanding of the claims of Baha'u'llah. 

 Finally he answered the Voice of God by declaring himself a Baha. In this his wife was one with him and they both devoted themselves to espousing the new Cause. 

 About the early 1930's the depression forced the closing of the Fuller 

Brush Company in Australia

 and Mr. and Mrs. Bolton returned to America where they both entered the 

Palmer School of Chiropractic.

 After qualification, they returned to Australia in 1934 and commenced a joint practice. By now they had four children, 

Marie Antoinette, Mariette
Elizabeth and sons Stanley

Philip and John Rend.     

 As a family they lived for the Cause of Baha'u'llah and, naturally enough, their material circumstances were so blessed they were able to do more and more for the Faith. 

 It was during 1936 that a third thread was woven into thepattern of Stanley's life, athread that was to make a dream come true. 

 Set amidst wild gums of the Australian bushland, seventy miles from Sydney, they built the home that was to become Australia's first Summer School. Mr. and Mrs. Dunn (who had become known affectionately to the Australian Baha as Father and Mother Dunn) laid the foundation stone for them. Here, at first, they spent leisure days, but in 1942 Stanley and his wife made the property their permanent residence. 

 Working more devotedly for the Faith, the Bolton property became more frequently used by other Baha'is for meetings of various kinds until 1952, when they handed over the property to the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Australia.    

 Thus was established the first official cultural centre for Summer and Winter Schools on this continent. 

 From the day of his meeting with Hyde Dunn, Stanley William )3olton endeavoured to serve the Cause of 

Baha'u'llah. Whether      
on the Local Teaching     

Committee, the Summer School
Committee, Temple Construction

 Committee  or as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly, he was forthright and definite in both thought and deed. Of the twenty years, 1937 —  1958, he served on the National Spiritual Assembly for seventeen, frequently as chairman. 

 A source of encouragement and inspiration were the words of Shoghi Effendi addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Bolton in a letter dated July 30, 1941: ..... When I recall your magnificent services, and especially when I remember the spirit which animates you in your task, I feel grateful to Baha'u'llah for having raised you up in that faraway continent, and inspired you to promote and establish His Faith. 

 He will surely watch over you both and bless the splendid work you are achieving. 

 The year 1953 brought to Stanley and his


<p325>
IN MEMORIAM                325

 wife the joyous privilege of representing Australia and New Zealand at the dedication of the Wilmette Temple and the bounty of going on pilgrimage to Haifa. From their pilgrimage, they brought back to Australia gifts from the Guardian of the Faith — a cream fez of 'Abdu'l-Baha and a sketch of the Shine of the Rib. Abdu'l-Baha R~Thiyyih KhAnum, too, entrusted to their care a picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha  as a young man, and peacock feathers and a Persian silk cloth. 

 Their Yerrinbool home was enriched by visits from many early pioneers, among whom were Keith Ransom-Keller (appointed a Hand of the 

Cause in 1933), Martha     
Root (appointed a Hand     

 of the Cause in 1939), and Siegfried Schopflocher (appointed a Hand of the Cause in 1952). It was Mr. Schopilocher who suggested "Bolton Place" as the name for the property. 

 Although with the passing years Stanley's physical activity had to be somewhat curtailed, his dedication to the Cause remained the passion  of his life. 

 Anyone who has been in the Faith for some years cannot visit the Ijaziratu'1-Quds without feeling the spirit, the vitality and the warmth of Stanley's presence. 

 I recall him as a man immaculate in dress, dynamic in manner, having a keen sense of humour and warmly spontaneous in friendship. Above all, a dedicated follower of 

Baha'u'llah.               

 The measure of his service to the Faith can be judged from the cable sent by the Universal House of Justice at the time of his passing:

      IBRAHIM CHALARJ            

  1879 — 1963 IbrAhim Chalabi was born in SulaymAniyyih, '1r6q, in the year 1879. His parents died when he was a small child. He went to Turkey in 1900 

     Ibrd him Chalabi           

  and studied in the old schools in Kalis. In the year 1910 he took up residence in Aqsar&i, Konya. In this period he was guided to the Baha'i Faith by his brother who had come from Cairo to visit him. 

 Mr. Chalabi was initially engaged in corn-merical enterprises and then for thirtyfive years served the Muslim community as a preacher and mu'adhdhin. 

 About 1951 when organized Baha activities commenced in that part of the world, Mr. Chalabi resigned from the abovementioned  spiritual position, was officially registered as a Baha'i and arose to serve as a teacher and administrator of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Mr. Chalabi engaged inactive teaching work in Saratli, Baymis and AqsarAi, and a great number of the Baha in these centers are among his spiritual children. 

 In 1955 he pioneered to Erzurum and enrolled a family of eight members who are now under the shadow of the Faith. He pioneered to Adrianople in 1957 and there served as a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly and as custodian of the House of Baha'u'llah. 

 In addition, he served as a traveling teacher, visiting other Baha'i

 centers where all the friends benefited from his presence. 

 In 1963, at the age of nearly eighty-four, Mr. Chalabi passed to the AbM Kingdom, mourned by a wide circle of friends and admirers, and leaving three children who have espoused the Faith which won their father's wholehearted allegiance and inspired his devoted service. 
                          
   FRANCISCO CHIRIVITO       

  Francisco Chirivito was neither young nor in good health when he accepted the Baha'i Faith in Calacala, Province of Bustillos, Bolivia, but he arose immediately to dedicate his remaining strength and health to its service, holding regular meetings in his home and traveling to attend Baha conferences. 

 He accompanied traveling teachers on their visits to the friends in the area and, although he was not literate, he was himself a splendid teacher. 

 With his assistance the membership of the Calacala community grew to eighty. 

 A friend records a description of the passing of Mr. 

Chirivito in January      

 1967: "After attending the National Convention Mr. Chirivito did not have enough for his trip. 

 He walked back to his village, a journey that took six days. He visited some huts on his way and talked about the Faith. 

 This is an example of his service. When returning home on foot from another Baha'i meeting during the rainy season we came to a river which he could not cross. We remained with him on the shore and during the night he passed away. Thus his sacrificial service to the Cause continued to the very end." 

ISIDRO C. JACHAKOLLO      
                          
   GENEVIEVE LENORE COY      

 1886 — 1963 Dr. Genevieve Coy, for more than half a century, served the Baha Faith selflessly and unceasingly with distinction in a wide variety of roles, as pioneer, teacher, administrator and author. 

 To have known Genevieve Coy was to have found a confidant and friend, and to have had one's horizons expanded beyond the limitations of self. She was keenly interested in the spiritual capacity within the individual, the creative energy with which the Teachings tell us all men are endowed, and through her written articles and spoken discourses Dr. Coy en-deavoured  to bring others to this awareness of their latent capacities. 

 Before she came into contact with the Baha'i Faith in 1911, Dr. Coy composed a poem, "Let Me Know Life", published in the early 

Baha'i magazine, Star     

 of the West (Vol. XXI, No. 4, July 1930, p. 101), of which the editors wrote: It was as if she had previously reached out subconsciously  for truth and had arrived at an attitude of mind and spirit which made the truth of the Baha'i Cause a complete fulfillment of her spiritual aspirations." 

 One felt that Genevieve Coy's Baha service was her grateful response to that fulfillment. 

 Of the many articles contributed by Dr. Coy to Baha'i publications over the years, none is more precious than the account of her pilgrimage  to the Holy Land, made between September 1 — 8, 1920, in company with Mabel and Sylvia Paine, and Cora Grey. 

 Genevieve recounted this visit in several issues of Star of the West (Vol. xii, Nos. 10 — 13, Sept. — Nov. 1921, pp. 163 — 214). From her touching word portrait of the Master is derived, too, a portrait of Genevieve 

Coy:                      

 "It is very difficult to remember much of what He said. Indeed, it was almost difficult to listen! I wished only to look and look at the beauty of His face! For that was what impressed me first, the exquisite beauty of the Master. It was like the most beautiful pictures we have of Him, with life and color added. His is a face of living silver — the wonderful silver of hair and beard, and the blue of His eyes. The side face is majestic  and sweet and loving. It was that which we saw most of the time. The full face is more dignified; to me it seemed more awe-inspiring. And yet, when He smiled, it was most exquisitely  friendly, and human! But He looked very, very tired... and yet the weariness was not, I think, a weariness of spirit. I cannot tell why I felt that way, partly because lIe can reach, as no one else can, the infinite sources of spiritual strength. 

 "I had no desire to speak to the Master; there was nothing that I could say. I do not

   Genevieve Lenore Coy       

  know what happened in my mind and heart. There was no shock, no surprise, no sadness, no thought of my own faulty past. 

 But I came to understand that for one who has been long in His presence, there can be no desire except to serve Him; that one's life would be happy only as one pleased Him; that one would be sad oniy as one grieved Him. 

 I felt then that I had begun to learn — that the will to serve was becoming greater, as I had prayed that it might.. 

 In 1921, after the passing of Miss Lillian Kappes who had served as director of the Tarbiyat School for girls in Tih~n, the Master asked whether someone from the American Baha'i community could be sent to Persia to carry on her work. "The Annual Convention of last year (1921) with His confirmation chose Miss Genevieve L. Coy, a specialist in the education  of gifted children and teacher of psychology  in one of the great State Universities, who this spring took her Ph.D. at Columbia University, New York," states the account of this incident in Star of the West. 

 "During the year she has been studying Persian and preparing for her work of teaching English to the children in Tihr~n. 

 She sailed from New York for Egypt, May 10, 1922. She will stop in the Holy Land on her way to Persia." Under her able directorship the school continued to grow in reputation and stature and became the foremost institution of its kind in Persia. Dr. Coy's description of the Tarbiyat School appeared in an article entitled 

"Educating the Women       

 of Persia", Star of the West, Vol. xvii, No. 1, April 1926, p.50. 
 Upon her return to the     

United States, Genevieve   

 Coy made a highly effective contribution  to the work of the Cause, serving for a number of years on the Spiritual Assembly of New York City. A friend describes this period: "I had the privilege of serving on the Spiritual Assembly at a time when Genevieve was chair-nun.  I was deeply impressed by her sensitivity to others; how she drew out the timid Assembly member and, with loving kindness, subdued the too vocal member. She was boundless in her patience with others. 

 She was never quick in passing judgment but always considered the motives of the individual. 

 It is obvious that her educational background, her training as' a doctor of psychology, gave her a deep insight into areas of thought and behaviour with which the average believer was unfamiliar. Her compassionate and warm nature drew many to her for counselling. 

 "Not oniy was she a fine administrator, but an outstanding teacher as well. Her own thirst for knowledge was contagious and a like thirst rapidly developed in her students. 

 She made any topic so interesting that soon one became fascinated with the Writings on the subject. Early in the Ten Year Crusade I remenTher that Dr. Coy gathered a large number of believers at the New York Baha'i Centre and had each one select for study one of the pioneer goals of the Plan. We were asked to go to the public library and return with all the information we could obtain about our particular subject. Genevieve made an adventure of learning. As a result of that research project, many of the participating believers pioneered to distant goals during the 

Crusade."                  

 Mr. H. Borrah Kavelin has provided this tribute to Genevieve Coy: "I have the deepest admiration for Genevieve  Coy with whom I was associated in service on the Spiritual 

Assembly of New York City  

 from 1941 onward. Baha'u'llah has written: '0 Son of Man! For everything there is


<p328>
328                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 a sign. The sign of love is fortitude under My decree and patience under My trials.' Fortitude, patience, detachment and integrity are the qualities that best describe the life and service of this devoted, highly competent and faithful maidservant of 

Baha'u'llah. Suffering     

 for many years from aphysicaldisabilitywhich caused her to walk with what must have been a painful limp, Genevieve Coy was always the essence of radiance and serene acceptance of God's Will. 

 "As a distinguished educator in the field of psychology, she was able to relate herself closely to the Teachings of 'Abdu'l-Baha and His example in dealing with the various problems that came before the Spiritual Assembly in the City of the Covenant, New York. She served on the Assembly for many years and was a tower of strength for all who sought her wise counsel. 

 By nature, she was modest and selfeffacing, but in relation to matters affecting the Faith she was a model of courage, conviction  and assurance. 

 Although shy, she had a wry sense of humour and was always a pleasant and cheerful companion. 

 "Her entire life was an example of total dedication to the Faith. Assuredly, her passing was an unqualified passport to the Abh~ Kingdom where loving arms awaited her arrival." 

 A contemporary of Genevieve Coy records: "Those of us who had the privilege of serving with 

Dr. Coy at Green Acre      

 Bali WI School of which she was senior administrator and chairman  of the program committee, would perhaps single out this contribution as one of her great services to the Faith, if not her greatest. She transformed Green Acre from a vacation place, where people of different religious and philosophical  persuasions met, to a school of education, Her experience as principal of the Dalton School in New York City, one of the first progressive schools in the United States, and her deep understanding of the Writings, contributed much to the success of Green Acre during the years she administered it. She was always considerate in her planning of the programs of Green Acre, taking into account the needs of those who were just approaching the Faith and of those confirmed and longstanding believers 'who had read everything'. 

 She found a way of including everyone in the classes and curriculum  and, avoiding rigidity, allowed for creati vity and exploration. 

 But study one must if he or she were to remain at Green Acre. The school could well be a memorial to Genevieve Coy. 

 In 1957, Dr. Coy retired from the Dalton School and looked forward to the freedom retirement would bring, but after six months she had had all she wanted of retirement and at the Intercontinental Conference held in Chic-cago in May 1958, she was one of those who came forward to the platform and volunteered to pioneer to Alaska or Africa. 

 Her physician suggested the warmer climate. She left immediately  for Salisbury, Rhodesia. 

 Her con-eluding  years of service were to be performed on a third continent. 

The National Spiritual Assembly

 of the Baha'is of Rhodesia has written: "Genevieve Coy came to South Africa as a pioneer very late in her life but was of tremendous service to the Faith during the period she lived here. While in Salisbury she lived at the National Baha'i Centre for a time, enabling many Baha'i friends to benefit from her vast knowledge of and experience in the Faith. She wrote two correspondence courses which were and are in wide use, one on Baha History and one on character development entitled 

'To Live the Life.'        

 "Genevieve was a devoted and dedicated soul, serving Baha'u'llah under great physical stress in the last years of her life in Salisbury. She was sadly missed by all when she passed away on July 31, 1963. How fitting that she was laid to rest next to the first African woman to accept the message of J3ah&u'11&h in Rhodesia!" 

 Genevieve Coy's life was a rich and faithful exemplification of one of her favourite passages from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha: "How wonderful it will be when the teachers are faithful, attracted and assured, educated and refined Baha'is, well-grounded in the science of pedagogy and familiar with child psychology; thus they may train the children with the fragrances of God. In the scheme of human life the teacher and his system of teaching plays the most important role, carrying  with it the heaviest responsibilities and most subtle influence."

IN MEMORIAM                329
       ~UBUI DANIEL              

 1910 — 1968 On January 4, 1968, at the age of fifty-eight, Mr. ~ubbi Daniel passed away following a short illness. 

 Mr. Daniel first received the Baha message in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1947. After embracing the Faith, Mr. Daniel rapidly distinguished 

       5ubki Daniel              

  himself as a well-qualified teacher. His particular interest, because of his orthodox Muslim background, was in gathering proofs from the Holy Books of other faiths, and esp&ially IslAm, pertaining to his newly-espoused religion. 

 Tn 1957 he moved to Cairo and succeeded  in enrolling four friends who, in turn, shared the message with their relatives at SuWtj, upper Egypt, in 1964. 

 When an outbreak of hostility directed against Baha occurred in 1965, Mr. Daniel was among the thirteen friends who were imprisoned and investigated. During his one-month  internment he took an active part in establishing good relationships with prisoners of other faiths, winning their love and sympathy.  An opportunity arose for Mr. Daniel to address a meeting held for the specific purpose of discussing the aims and purposes of the Faith with the Chief Officer, the Director and the Secretary of the prison whose interest was won by his lucid exposition. 

 On another occasion an invitation was extended to Mr. Daniel to address the weekly prisoners' meeting, usually addressed by a teacher of the Muslim faith. The real intention clearly was to render Mr. Daniel embarrassed before the attending prisoners when he would be subjected to provocative cross-examination by the Muslim teacher during the question period. In the discussion that followed Mr. Daniel's talk the Muslim teacher enquired about Baha'i moral and social laws. In explain-tion, Mr. Daniel described the renewal from age to age of the eternal spiritual verities of religion, and the evolving social teachings established by the Manifestations in keeping with the exigencies of the time. The teacher, angered by the explanation and the suggestion that Baha'u'llah had established the standards of justice for this age and had abrogated the Islamic tradition of punishing thieves by severing  their hands, arose to protest that Islamic law was unchangeable and represented the sole remedy for the ills of society. 

 His vitriolic defense of Muslim tradition aroused the bitter and vocal opposition of the prisoners to the old law and their recognition of the need to welcome the mitigation brought in the Teachings of DahA'u'I1&Ia. 

 In 1967 Mr. Daniel was again imprisoned, with twenty-six other Baha'is, from June 8 to November 13. During that time he was active in establishing friendly relations with other prisoners and wherever possible sharing with them the Baha'i Teachings. 

 Mr. Rawshan Yazdi was among the interned Baha and was well known to most members of the Muslim Brotherhood Association for his humane services at Port Said, which provided the opportunity  for the Faith to become a topic of discussion among the prisoners. With the approval of the detention camp commander and his officers, evening meetings, attended by twenty or more members of the Muslim Brotherhood and four or five Baha, were held for the purpose of discussing the Baha'i Teachings. 

 Often the meetings, held over a three-month period, would last until daybreak. Mr. Daniel's capacity to offer irrefutable proofs ofBah&u'11Th's fulfillment of Islamic traditions and prophecies, drawn from his deep know

330                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 ledge of the Muslim religion, amazed all those who heard him. He made an unforgettable contribution to the firm establishment and ultimate victory of the Cause. 

 Such was the rich life and blessed ending of Subbi Daniel. His wife and children stood firm and succeeded in arranging his interment in the Baha'i cemetery despite the strong opposition of his unsympathetic relatives. 

 May his soul abide in peace in the Kingdom of Abh~!

       To the National Spiritual  
Assembly of the United     

States, the Universal      

 House of Justice added the note that the passing of William deForge was an "inexpressible loss teaching work Western Hemisphere." 

 How befitting his life was Billy's departure from this earth! On May 3, 1963, the morrow of the Most Great Jubilee, he died suddenly of a heart attack while sharing the glad tidings of Baha'u'llah with strangers on a Paris-bound train. 

 I-laying left his own compartment to make friends in another, he was telling a French family about the Faith and with his arm around the shoulder of one of them had just made an appointment to meet them at the Paris Baha'i Center. 

 "Don't grieve," they later told his wife, "your husband was the happiest of men." 

 The personality of William deForge was so vibrant, the warmth of his heart so all-embrac-ing,  the area of his friendships so wide, that the news of his death was a shock that reverberated in many countries. He, whose life was completely  dedicated to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, had shared in the blissful Centenary celebration of "the accession of Him Who is the Lord of the Kingdom to the throne of everlasting glory"; he, whose dearest desire was the promotion of the divine institutions, had lived to witness the establishment of the supreme legislative body; he, who had contributed so much to the victories of the World Crusade, had just gone out from the center of the global thanksgiving for its triumphant conclusion; he, who so loved to be with people, had in the last few days of his life been among more than six thousand believers, spending the happiest hours with friends from all over the world; he who had proclaimed the principles of God's Hoiy Revelation far and wide spent his last breath talking of the oneness of mankind; he who had traveled to so many countries to teach the Cause of God, died while delivering the message to strangers in a foreign land. 

 In November of 1941 the Guardian had written to him,.., to promote the teaching work in the most effective manner, to consolidate the institutions of the Faith, to promote unity and cooperation among the believers, and to proclaim far and wide the regenerative principles and laws of this glorious Revelation." 

 How faithful was this steward to each one of these directives from the Sign of God! 

 William deForge was born in Jersey City on January 17, 1899, the son of a Canadian father whose parents had emigrated from France. Raised in that city, William married his childhood sweetheart, Catherine Marie de Garcia, and was a lifelong resident of the State of New Jersey. 

 For a period of eight years he organized and conducted the North Jersey 

Symphony Orchestra. Often  

 he compared the part that each individual had to play in the Cause to the various instruments of a great orchestra. For thirtyfive years, until his death, his work was in real estate in New York City, and he was a member of the New York Real Estate Board and the National Association of Realtors. 

 Mrs. Laura C. Wilhelm introduced Billy to theFaithwhichhe acceptedinApril 1933 andto which he gave so many years of devoted, self-sacrificing service. In the words of his wife, "The Faith came first; it was his whole life." Elected almost immediately to the Teaneck Spiritual Assembly he was a member of that Assembly, and for some years its chairman, until the family moved to Hackensack where an Assembly was formed, due largely to Billy's untiring efforts. 

 In the first Seven Year Plan his great capacity

IN MEMORIAM                331

  William deForge for teaching was placed at the disposal of both the National Teaching Committee and the Inter-America Committee. Under the auspices of the latter committee he made "an important voyage" in 19384939 to the virgin territories of the Dominican 

Republic and Puerto      

 Rico. "His success in these two countries was phenomenal. His list of contacts was so numerous that the Inter-America Committee was obliged to place them in its Baha'i Bulletin." 
He succeeded in contacting

President Jos6 Ramfrez   
Santefanez of Puerto     

 Rico who was thrilled with the message and the literature. The librarians of both San Juan and the Trujillo libraries stated that they would be happy to accept Baha'i books and place the Baha magazine, World Order, on their reading tables. 

 The newspapers wrote of his peace-bringing message. Over the years the National Spiritual Assembly  appointed Mr. deForge to the membership of various national committees. 

 In addition, because of his loyalty, his tact, his exceptional capacity for meeting people in all walks of life and the confidence he inspired, he was often entrusted with special missions. 

 He was the official observer for the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States at the United Nations sessions until he could no longer continue because of his tremendous responsibilities  as a member of the Auxiliary Board and chairman of the Western Hemisphere 

Teaching Committee.      

 As chairman of the latter committee  and its only continuous member for the entire decade of the World Crusade he guided its vast network of operations and, by his dynamic and enthusiastic leadership and his efficient attention to the innumerable details of its work, made a great contribution to the spread of the Faith in the West. 

 At RWv6n 1954 through his appointment by the Hands of the Cause for the Western Hemisphere to their Auxiliary Board, he took part in the inauguration of the historic mission of the Hands of the Cause. It is difficult to •   estimate his great services as "deputy, assistant and adviser to the Hands". 

 He combined the utmost loyalty to the institutions of the Faith ~    and steadfast adherence to principle, with a gentle warm sympathy for each individual. 

 While seeing clearly and feeling deeply the needs, the gaps between existing conditions and what they should be, always his loving enthusiasm  inspired the believers to greater dedication  and service. 

 "Galvanize" was a word he often used, and when he visited the friends he effectively galvanized their efforts. He was a dynamic public speaker and an effective attractor in intimate meetings. 

 His missions for the Auxiliary Board took him throughout the United States, Canada and Alaska, and most of the Latin American Republics. Following the 1958 Conference in Frankfurt, Germany, he visited eight European countries. 

     Billy exemplified Baha  

 hospitality and the warm, openhearted atmosphere of the de-Forge  home drew large numbers of people to their happy and instructive fireside meetings. Many friends now hold tender memories of the joyful hours spent in that home. 

 But Billy was host not oniy in his own house but in whatever gathering he happened to be in, for Billy loved people and his love for man was universal. Once, when ifihing out a visa application, he wrote in the blank for race: 

"Human                   

 Everything he did combined his love for God and his love for man. The calls at his office were as likely to be fox the Faith as for his business, and every call was answered with the same

 kindly interest. With the vision of the Cause always in his heart, he responded to the duty at hand. 

 His body now lies in the Bogneux Cemetery in France, the home of his ancestors. 

 He lived and died triumphantly for the Cause of God. 

  "Arise for the triumph of My Cause, that while yet on earth thou mayest obtain the victory."

   'ABDU'L-QADJR DIRI6Z       

  1888 — 1963 'Abdu'1-QAdir Diri6z was born in 1888 in Birecik, a town on the shore of the Euphrates in southeastern Turkey, and died in 1963 at the age of seventy-five in Ankara. After completion of his primary education, Mr. Diri6z successfully taught himself Persian and Arabic literature. 

 At the age of twenty-six he came to know about the Baha'i Faith through his uncle, the late Shibi 

~hay~h Muslim. Assisted    

 in his study by the friends in Gh6zi 'AntTh, he readily embraced the Cause. 

 Three times — first in Birecik, his home; then in Adana; and finally in Aksaray, a dependency of Konya — he was tried for being a Baha'i and imprisoned. 

 He defended himself on all three occasions bravely and with absolute faith and assurance, and was the cause of awakening many people to the truth of the revelation of Baha'u'llah. 

 In 1957, at the request of the National Spiritual Assembly of Turkey, Mr. Diri6z took up residence in the national Ijazfratu'1-Quds in Istanbul and engaged in translating the Baha'i Writings, teaching the friends, speaking at conferences and serving as a traveling teacher. Among the important translations made into oldTurkishby 

Mr. Diri6z are Nabil's     
Narrative, Esslemont's     

 Baha'u'llah and the New Era, and Kitdb-i-Fard'id. 

 His original writings in old Turkish include A History of the Baha'u'llah in Birecik and Memories, The Promised One of all Nations, and Ithbdt-i Ul4hiyyat ('Proofs of the Existence of God"). 
     At the age of thirty-three 

Mr. Diri6z married Miss    
~~ayriyyih Doktoruglu.     

 The three children of the marriage are all loyal supporters

      SALMAN DEQOMY              

  1905 — 1965 Salm6n Dloomy was one of the wellknown believers of 'IrAq, a faithful, steadfast and devoted Baha'i who served the Faith of Baha'u'llah until his last days. His entire Baha'i life was full of various brilliant achievements. He was courageous in defending the Cause, active and extremely zealous, and he served the Faith in many fields. He was the treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly and a member of the Spiritual Assembly of BaghdAd until the end of his earthly life. 

 In his professional career Mr. Dloomy held an important position in one of the best known banks in Bag~d6d. 

 By virtue of his constant contact with various merchants and government  officials he used to seek propitious occasions  to speak about the Faith. He distinguished himself particularly by his generous support of every achievement undertaken for the promo-

      Salrndn Dicomy            

  tion of the Cause in 'Ir&q. His last gift to the Baglichid community was a portion of land to be used as a Ba1A'i cemetery. His financial advice and the temporary aid he would generously provide to the National Spiritual Assembly were greatly valued and facilitated the vital work of the Cause in that area. 

 Mr. Dloomy's Baha'i marriage was openly conducted amid a large gathering of Baha'is and other friends and served as a means of publicly proclaiming the Faith in Bag~d~d. His zeal and devotion won him the love and appreciation of Shoghi Effendi who cabled him on the occasion of his marriage tendering congratulations, extolling his exemplary behaviour  and pledging prayers for unprecedented blessings. 
                          
       FRANCES ESTY              

 1878 — 1963 Mrs. Frances Esty's name will long be remembered by the Baha world for two particular actions: arranging for the painting of the portrait of 'Abdu'l-Baha by the distinguished Polish-American artist, Sigismond Ivanowski,1 and the establishment with the cooperation of her husband, Harold M. Esty, of the Esty Scholarship Fund in the American University at Beirut, Lebanon, for Baha'i students. 

 Mrs. Esty first learned of the Baha'i Faith from her mother, Mrs. John D. Larkin, who read much about it but never became a Baha'i. Two books that appear to have led Mrs. Esty to embrace the Faith were a compilation of excerpts from the Writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, probably given her by an early believer, and one compiled by the Reverend James Storer, a Christian minister in Buffalo, New York, which included quotations from The Hidden Words, 

Kitdb-i-Iqdn and Tablets  
of 'Abdu'l-Baha.        

 In 1912 when 'Abdu'1-Da.h~ visited Buffalo the Esty family was living in nearby Queens-town,  Ontario, Canada, but Frances was unable to visit Him, a fact she deeply regretted during the remainder of her life. 

 In 1927, in memory of 'Abdu'l-Baha and with the permission of Shoghi Effendi, Mrs. Esty established the scholarship fund already mentioned. 

 In 1930 Mrs. Esty attended the annual Baha'i Convention in Wilmette, Illinois, in company with Mrs. Grace 

Ober and Mrs. Harriett    

 L. Bush and was a guest in the home of Mr. Louis Bourgeois, designer of the Baha'i House of Worship. 

 That same year she compiled a collection of Writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha which was published under the title, The Garden of the Heart. In that year she also arranged for the painting of the wellknown portrait of the Master by Sigismond Ivanowski. 

 The portrait was completed in 1931.2 Soon afterwards 

Mrs. Esty visited Shoghi  
Effendi in Haifa, Palestine

 and there received permission from him to have the portrait sent to the Holy Land. 

 The following year Mr. and Mrs. Ivanowski personally carried the portrait to Haifa and delivered it to the 

Guardian.                 

 While Mrs. Esty was in the Holy Land, Mr. Ivanowski was inspired to paint another portrait of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 This one was hung in an upstairs room of Mrs. Esty's home where it became a beautiful teaching medium and an inspiration to Baha who frequently visited 1 The EaAd'f World, vol. v, p. 76.     ibid.,pp. 77 — 79.

  the room to pray and meditate. This portrait was sent some years later to the National Baha'i Archives in Wilmette, Illinois. 

 For many years Mrs. Esty served as a member r of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Buffalo. Many distinguished persons, Baha'is and nonBahA'is, were guests in her home in Buffalo and her summer home in Lakeview, 

New York.

 Suffering from Parkinson's disease, Mrs. Esty was confined from the early 1950's to a wheelchair and later to her bed. On January 13, 1963 she entered the AbliA Kingdom. Her close Baha'i friend, Mrs. Harriett Bush, who supplied d the facts for this article, wrote that Mrs. Esty was "a loving, sharing, friendly person, shy, but very firm and always courageous for her beloved Faith." 

            CHARLOTTE M. LINFOOT

                   JINAB-I-FAI2IL

 1 88O( ?) — 4 957 Mirza Asadu'llAh F6jil, one of the prominent teachers and scholars of the Faith, was born into a noble family in ThirftirflTh (B6bul), a city in MAzindar6~n, 

IrAn.                      

 His studies began during his early childhood at his home under the tutelage of his father. When he was in his teens he participated in the discourses given by notable scholars in his city who were the followers of ~hay~h Abmad-i-AtisA'i. 

 F64ilbecamearecognizedscholarwhen he was only twenty years old, His assiduous study made him an authority in the current knowledge of his time, in Arabic literature, philosophy, astronomy, logic and 

Islamic traditions. When   

 he was still under the care and tutelage of his teacher, a number of his fellow students chose him as their own teacher. 

 It was at this time that F~ji1 became acquainted with Baha'is who were his father's friends. 

 Moreover,  he had the opportunity to meet some of the survivors of Fort Tabarsi. F64i1 traveled to TibrAn with some of his own students in order to improve his knowledge and meet some of the outstanding scholars who lived in that city. At the same time, he himself used to teach. 

 In Tihxdn he was able to contact some of the prominent Baha. He expressed the wish to study the revealed Tablets of Baha'u'llah, The first of these which came to his hand was Bishdrdt 

("The Glad Tidings").      

 As a result of reading this and other Tablets and Writings of Baha'u'llah, he became an enthusiastic Baha'i Thereafter he immersed himself in the ocean of the Writings and improved his knowledge of the Faith. 

 He immediately began to teach the Faith to his fellow students in TihrAn and gradually he became known in the circle of his friends as a Baha. 

 Except for a number of broadminded friends who continued their admiration and friendship, the rest, particularly the MullAs, ostracized him. 

 F~jiI in this period wrote a letter to 'Abdu'l-Baha and expressed his acceptance of the Faith and beseeched the Master to advise him about his future services. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha encouraged him to teach the Faith. From that moment he left everything and became one of the bestknown  and most successful Baha'i teachers. 

 Shortly after, the Master gave FAglil a mission. 

 He was asked to travel to 'Iraq and meet MuIIA Mul2ammad Mzim, the head of the Shi'ah sect of IslAm. The purpose of his mission was to acquaint this important Muslim personage  with the Faith and assure him that Baha'is do not participate in political activities and are


<p335>
IN MEMORIAM                335
free of religious prejudices.

 He was to assure the MuIIA that Baha'is are well-wishers of the world and do not wish to harm any person. 

 The reason 'Abdu'l-Baha wanted FAQi1 to seek this interview was that at that time in Persia there had been violent confrontations between those who supported the concept of a parliamentary form of government and those who supported the monarchy. 

 In the ensuing confusion the Azalis, who were the active enemies of the Baha, joined hands with fanatical elements in the country and incited the heads of both factions against the Faith. To the monarchists the Rah&is were accused of being in favor of constitutional government and to the constitutional  faction they were accused of being supporters  of the monarchic regime. If the true position of the Baha'is were not made known to the prominent leaders, the Baha would be placed in very grave danger. Such a delicate and important mission was not carried out without considerable danger to the life of FThil and his companion, 

Mirza 'Abdu'1 ~Lusayn      
ArdistThi.                 

 In the first days of their arrival at Najaf which was the seat of the great MuIIA both these friends were arrested, chained, imprisoned  and later sent back to Persia. The letters and writings of F64ilwere confiscated. However, he was able to discharge the task entrusted to him by the Master as a result of these events. 

 An elaborate and exhaustive interrogation was conducted in the presence of the representatives of the Persian government and others during which F~i4i1 had the opportunity to explain the purpose of his mission and defend the Baha position. The details of these interrogations were conveyed officially to Mu1J~ K6zirn and through the Persian representative reached the ears of other political figures in the country. 

 FAdil served the Cause until his last breath, both in Persia and beyond the borders of his native land. 

 During his fifty years of service to the Faith he had the privilege of meeting 'Abdu'l-Baha three times: on his return from 'IrAq and before his visit to India; when he was sent by the Master to the United States; and upon returning from his teaching trip to America. 

 After the ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha the beloved Guardian asked F6411 and his family to come to the Holy Land and from there go to the United States to teach the Cause. The first visit of FAQi1 to the United States lasted more than one year. On the second journey he spent over two years in various parts of the United States and Canada. He won many individuals to the Faith in those countries and held lectures in synagogues, churches, universities and addressed various organizations such as the Theosophists and others. 

 A moving appreciation of F64i1's services abroad is found in a publication of the Baha'is of the United States, The Baha'i Centenary (1844 — 1944), a booklet describing the development  of the Cause in the West: "Undoubtedly the crowning event of the latter part of this entire period (1917 — 1920) was the arrival in this country of the distinguished Baha'i teacher from Persia, a precious gift from 'Abdu'l-Baha to the Baha teaching program in America for 'Abdu'l-Baha had said He would send us 'a rjpenedsozd.' 

 He did fulfill this promise in the person of JinTh-i-FAJiI who He said had been 'growing for a long time,' that 'lie was wise, well informed and a thinker, a revered person, learned, sincere, humble andseveredfrom mortal things.' 

 "JinTh-i-Th4i1's arrival in this country produced the greatest happiness. 

 Literally volumes could be written about his brilliant services. 

 He travelled from the Atlantic to the Pacific, visiting every Baha Center en route and in each Center he spoke before crowded audiences in churches, colleges, organizations of every kind. Indeed he travelled a pathway of Light, the Light of the Kingdom, and there is no doubt that thousands and thousands heard the Baha'i message proclaimed by him in a scholarly manner. He served sincerely and brilliantly, and, with wisdom, graciousness and eloquence. 

 He proved to be indeed 'Abdu'l-Baha's  'gift to America'. The story of his teaching  tour when recorded in detail will form a unique chapter in the Baha history of this country.., 

 his work was so deeply appreciated that it greatly surpassed any adequate expression  of gratitude." 

 Other teaching trips were undertaken by flQil. He spent about eleven months in India and briefer periods of time in various parts of Caucasia and Turkistan. 

 His last years were spent in the service of the Cause in Persia. He travelled to all the important places in that co~mtry and for some years served as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly as well as of the Spiritual 

Assembly of TilirAn. His   
services


<p336>
336THE BAHA'I WORLD

  were greatly valued by the beloved Guardian and all those who entered his presence benefited from his vast knowledge. 

 The Persian section of the early Baha'i magazine Star of the West was edited by FAjil and the portions in Persian script were written in his own hand. In addition he wrote and compiled  numerous books, some of which are encyclopedic works about the Faith. Perhaps his most significant work is a compilation of Baha'i history in nine volumes called Zuhara'? Ijaq. 

 He is the author of many articles which have appeared in Baha periodicals. 

 In spite of his prominence and scholarship F64iI was kind and humble by nature and was loved by all who came in contact with him. On December 26, 1957, when he was going to a Baha'i meeting he passed away of a heart attack and his seventy-seven years of service to the Cause of God were ended. A more detailed biography of F~ji1 is printed in the the seventh volume of Ma~vdbflz-i-Hiddyat. 
                              
       MARIO EJORENTINI              

 1887 — 1967  

Professor Mario Fiorentini    

 was a born artist. He had the great gift of being able to reproduce in drawings and colors the beauty of nature, which he saw with the eyes of a master, He was born and grew up in Rome. There he frequented the Academy of Fine Arts from which he graduated with distinction at the beginning of the twentieth century. He was fascinated by the great archeological riches of his native city, and he specialized in depicting, in various media, characteristic scenes of "old Rome" and other places. Some of his paintings found their way to foreign art galleries. 

 In his youth he had traveled to England, France, Spain and the United States, absorbing the beauty of the works of the great masters in architecture, sculpture and painting. He also became very proficient in the languages of those countries to the point where he could lecture with great facility on the history of art in any of them. Although he was born into a Jewish family which in the Middle Ages had been raised to the rank of nobility, he himself was not a follower of any religion, including  that of his forefathers, and considered himself an agnostic. 

Mario Fiorentini              

 The year 1935 found him in Palestine where he had gone at the request of the Italian Consular  authorities in Jerusalem to hold the first one-man Italian art show in that country. The success of his exhibit and the host of friends he won convinced him that he was justified in accepting a position of lecturer on art. He was also to teach English to beginners and to wouldbe teachers. When the Second World War started, he was arrested and interned in the prison of 'Aldd as an enemy alien, where he remained until by the intervention of some friends he was permitted to pursue his occupation without any further restriction. It was during this period that he visited Haifa and had the rare privilege and good fortune to become acquainted with the Baha Revelation,  by visiting the Shrine of the BTh on Mt. Carmel. 

 After this visit, he wrote some years later: "On leaving the Gardens I felt deeply transformed; from that day I knew with certainty that I had finally acquired a Faith, the culmination of all my spiritual aspirations, which I would be willing to serve with all my capabilities." 

 It was not until 1948, however, that this opportunity  came to him. On completion of the war he returned to Italy to care for his beloved


<p337>
IN MEMORIAM                337

 wife who had become afflicted with an incurable disease. 

 During the months of great sorrow and grief after her death, a painter who had been his schoolmate and who had already accepted the Baha'i Faith, brought him to our home in Rome, at Via Liguria 38. His earlier desire to serve the Cause of Baha'u'llah became fulfilled. After a few weeks of instruction he was formally enrolled, with deep joy and conviction. At last he had found a Faith in which he could believe. 

 From that time until his last day on this earth he became an example of activity and dedication. 

 He was one of the first members of the Local Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Rome and its treasurer. 

 He assisted efficiently in the translation into Italian of the Sacred Writings, undertook teaching trips to various cities of the country and, in 1953, at the begin-fling  of the Ten Year Crusade, he was elected to the 

Italo-Swiss National      

 Spiritual Assembly, the twelfth National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'i world, at its formation in Florence, becoming its treasurer for the 

Italian area. In 1961     

 he was elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of the lBah&fs of Italy, and became its treasurer. In 1964 he was appointed an Auxiliary Board member to the Hands of the Cause in Europe, a position he was holding at the time of his passing on December 16, 1967, a few months before his eighty-first birthday. 

 His two pilgrimages to the World Center of the Faith, one during the beloved Guardian's life, strengthened his faith, particularly because Shoghi Effendi had been extremely loving and kind to him. 

 That love and kindness he brought with him wherever he went, and his passing grieved everyone who knew him. 

 He was generous in his services to the Cause, jovial and entertaining, a highly cultured gentleman whose rich knowledge gave him a great advantage  in presenting the Faith. 

 Because of his profound understanding or art and archeology, he has friends and correspondents all over the world who feel his loss deeply. 

 We were in the Americas when the sad news of his passing reached us. We felt that the Faith had lost one of its most devoted and dynamic servants, that Italy had lost an illustrious artist and critic, and that we had lost a much loved friend, a companion in our work and a true brother in the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

UGO AND ANGELINE GIACHERY 
    KATHRYN FRANKLAND         

 1872 — 1963 Kathryn Frankland was a pioneer and trail blazer. 

 She had the boldness, the faith, the indomitable spirit, the restless drive of a pioneer. Yet she was little in size, attractive in appearance, physically frail, and gentle in manner. She was kind andloving and easilywon people's confidence, always ready to help, to encourage, to inspire. 

 Early in life she found her goal and never deviated from it. She worked for it tirelessly,  incessantly, and with great joy. And in her work she made many devoted friends all over the United States and in many parts of the world. 

         Kathryn Sherman FranWand  

 was born on January 20, 1872, in the little town of Richiand Center, Wisconsin. 

 Her mother was a Universalist and very broadminded; she felt that creeds should not obscure the underlying reality. 

 Her father's family were Presbyterians. They were very religious and great believers in prayer. But they were serious people, almost austere. Richiand Center was isolated and dull. Lifethere was too confining for alively, spirited girl like Kathryn. 

 She would often go to her little attic bedroom and pray for release. 

 When the opportunity came to visit her sister in Mitchell, South Dakota, she felt like a bird released from its cage. During her visit she met a young traveling salesman by the name of Alec Frankland. 

 Mter a brief courtship, they were married. The family was shocked. Her sister fainted when she heard the news. Her mother did not write to her for six months. Undaunted, Kathryn returned to Richiand Center to see her mother. 

 She knocked on the door and said: "Here is your new son-in-law." 

 The young couple moved to Chicago. For a while they lived near the fair grounds where the great 

Columbian Exposition      

 had been held. In 1901 Alec Frankland became a newspaper man. In that same year something happened which was to affect Kathryn deeply and shape her wholelife. 

 Through aneiglibour she learned oftheflah6iiFaithandimmediatelyshe decided to inquire further. 

 Few English translations of the Baha'i Writings were available and fragmentary copies were scarce and eagerly sought. Kathryn obtained a copy of Baha'u'llah's Tablet to the Christians. She took it to her room


<p338>
338                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  and read: "0 Concourse of Christians. Ye make mention of Me, and know Me not. Ye call upon Me, and are heedless of My Revelation... 
As she read she could not restrain her tears.

 Then and there she knew she believed. She was transformed. More than ever she wanted to learn. She attended the small gatherings where Persian teachers sent from the Holy Land explained d the beliefs, the principles and the history of the new Faith. The more she learned, the more convinced and enthusiastic she became. 

 . She held meetings in her home, and once when the teacher was absent she took charge. 

 To be one of the few to know of the Prophet of God for this age filled her with awe and happiness. 
.

 Kathryn loved children but did not have any of her own. A deep yearning for a child was in her heart as she wrote to 'Abdu'I-]3ah~t to declare her faith. In 1902 the reply came in the first of many Tablets she was to receive from the 

Master:
     "0 Thou Handmaid of God:   

 It behooveth thee to turn thy whole being toward the Kingdom of God, to sever thyself from all save Him, to fill thyself with the love of God, to clothe thyself with the vesture of holiness and of freedom from worldly things, to adorn thyself with the robe of heavenly bestowals, to be a great sign amongst women — that the Supreme Concourse may breathe from thee a sweet fragrance that will reloice the hearts and refresh the souls. 

 Teach thou every soul thou findest ready to heed the call of God, for truly this is better for thee than the whole earth." 

  She had expected a different answer. At first she was stunned with disappointment. 

 Then gradually as the message reached her heart she recognized the mission that had been assigned to her. It was a divine summons to teach, to spread the "Glad Tidings". This became the goal of her life and long before the end a host of "spiritual children" called her 

"Mother Frankland".        

 She wrote again to 'Abdu'l-Baha with a great longing that her husband become a believer. 

 She did not express this yearning, saying instead: "Master, do you know what is in my heart?" 

 From 'Abdu'l-Baha came the now classic words: "Be confident in the bounty ofthyLord. Verily He will make thee a manifest example and an evident prooffor the attainment 

    Kathryn Frankland          

  of His Kingdom in this glorious century... The Spirit knowetl'z the spirit, the Spirit addresseth the spirit, and the Spirit associateth with the spirit." 

 In one year Alec became a Baha'i. Now the Franklands served the Faith together. 

 Baha'i teachers were needed in California. In 1903 Kathryn and Alec moved west and settled in Fruityale (now part of Oakland). 

 There they met Mrs. Helen S. Goodall and Mrs. Ella G. Cooper, prominent workers in the early days of the 

Cause in California.       

 There they met the Mattesons who soon became Baha'is. 

 There they met Kanichi Yamamoto, the first Japanese to join the Faith. 

 Kathryn became ill. It was at this time that a thirteen year old Japanese boy in knee pants came to the Franklands and asked to work for $1.50 a week. His name was Fujita, and they called him "the little squirrel". 

 He went to school, did the housework and washing. 

 He was small, but his mistress was smaller and he would carry her down to the garden. While Mrs. Isabella D. Brittingham, a pioneer Baha'i teacher, was a guest of the Franklands, Fujita declared that he was a Baha'i. This marked the beginning of a long life of service that later took him to Haifa.

     From Fruitvale the Franklands

 moved to Los Angeles, then to Glendale. In 1909 they took their newly-adopted baby and went to live in Mexico City. There they received 'Abdu'l-Baha's first Tablet about teaching in Mexico. 

 They were living in their Tropico (Glendale) home when the Master visited 

California in 1912. Kathryn

 was suffering from poor health but nothing could prevent her going to San Francisco to attend the meetings at which He spoke. On one occasion, 'Abdu'l-Baha took two little girls, one of them Helen Frankland, in His arms and held them while He talked: "I longed very much to see you all..." (then to the children) ". to see you and to kiss you. All My endeavours are for the purpose that you may be happy." 

 In 1920, a year before the passing of the Master, Kathryn obtained permission to make a pilgrimage and was a guest in the home of 'Abdu'l-Baha for thirty days, accompanied by Mrs. Goodall, Mrs. Cooper and other friends. Abdu'l-Baha gave them many important teachings, saying, "This is the Lord's Supper... Now we have gathered in this spot through the grace of His Holiness, Baha'u'llah. 

 In the same way that we are gathered at this table, we hope that we shall be gathered at the table in the Kingdom of Abhd. His Holiness, Christ, gathered His disciples one evening at supper and bestowed upon them His teachings because it was near the time of His crucifixion. He gave them as much as was necessary." 

 After the passing of the Master, Kathryn devoted her life to serving Shoghi 

Effendi.                  
     In 1922, Alec Frankland   

 died. Kathryn who had always been protected found herself without support. She joined the staff of Equitable Life, purchased a car, learned to drive, and became one of the company's most successful agents. 

 In 1925, she assisted in the establishment of the first Spiritual 

Assembly of Berkeley.     

 When the first Seven Year Plan was announced  by the Guardian Kathryn wholeheartedly  devoted herself to it and worked continuously towards its goals. 

 In 1944, at the age of seventy-two, when most people retire from active life, she embarked on a new and strenuous project. 

 She again offered to teach the Faith anywhere in the United States where there were few or no Baha'is. With limited funds and failing health, her back encased in a steel brace, she went from city to city, and from state to state, staying months here, years there, but always teaching, consolidating  and building new Assemblies. 

 A poignant glimpse into the life of Kathryn Frankland is afforded by even the most cursory examination of the letters she received from Shoghi Effendi between the years 1924 and 1955, letters which reflect her deep love of the Cause, her unceasing service, the joy she brought the Guardian, and the pride and admiration her exemplary services evoked in him. 

 On November 11, 1924, Shoghi Effendi wrote, "I assure you of my deep affection and ardent prayers for the success of your spiritual activities." 

 On November 24, 1925, he paid tribute to her long service: "Your magnificent services, your patient endeavours, your great devotion to the Cause of God will ever be remembered with gratitude and joy." "Your past services, your presentday endeavours and self-sacrificing labours are deeply appreciated by me, and will always be remembered with emotion and gratitude," he wrote on December 23, 1927. 

 Learning of her intention to pioneer, the Guardian wrote on September 22, 1936, "I am deeply touched and encouraged by your most welcome letter. Your pioneer move and above all your spirit of devotion will as a magnet attract the untold blessings of Baha'u'llah. How glorious the pioneer work which you are undertaking! Persevere and be happy." On November 1, 1940 he wrote saying, "I wish to assure you in person of my keen and abiding appreciation of the splendid services which you have, during so many years and with such marvellous devotion, rendered our beloved Faith. 

 I will certainly continue to pray for your welfare and success from the bottom of my heart, and feel truly proud of your achievements.  Persevere and rest assured." 

 Kathryn's success in confirming in the Cause an Eskimo believer inspired the Guardian to write on July 24, 1943, "I wish to congratulate you on your splendid and indeed historic achievement. 

 I am deeply grateful to you, and greatly admire the spirit that so powerfully animates you in the service of our beloved Faith. 

 In 1946 he wrote of her "splendid and meritorious labours" and "magnificent efforts"


<p340>
340                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 and in a letter dated September 24, 1947, again voiced his pride in her: "I wish to express in person my deep sense of appreciation of your constant, your deeply valued and notable endeavours for the spread of our beloved Faith. I feel truly proud of the spirit that animates you.. 

 Kathryn was to outlive the Guardian whom she loved so deeply and served with such distinction. 

 The sustaining comfort of her last years is found in the bright promise contained in a letter written by Shoghi Effendi through his secretary on May 22, 1955: "The Guardian greatly values your own devoted services to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 He assures you of rich spiritual rewards, not only in this world, but in the realms beyond. Your record of service is truly magnificent, having started in the early days of the Faith in America, and continuing though the first and second Seven Year Plans, and now the Ten Year Plan. 

 He assures you of his prayers on your behalf, and sends you his loving greetings." 

 At the age of eighty-seven, she was granted permission to see the Guardian and to visit the Holy Shrines. 

 Then, while she was making preparations for her journey, news came of the sudden death of Shoghi Effendi. She was grief-stricken,  disappointed and disheartened. Hearing of this, the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land sent her a special invitation to make her tragically interrupted pilgrimage. 
    She responded eagerly.    

 Alone, frail, and with failing eyesight, she flew to the Holy Land and prayed at the Sacred Shrines. 

 On the way back she went to London and prayed at the tomb of her beloved 

Shoghi Effendi. Then      
she came home.            

 She served faithfully to the end. On Sunday, November 4, 1963, shortly before her ninety-second  birthday, she died peacefully in her sleep.

      HENRIETTE FROM            

 1875 — 1967 Miss Henriette From ascended to the AbliA Kingdom on July 19, 1967, after a long life of dedicated service to the Cause of God in Hawaii. Simple graveside services were held 

      Henriette From            

  at her request when she was laid to rest at Hawaiian 

Memorial Park. On August  

 20 a memorial service was held at the national IJa4ratu'1-Quds for "Frommie" as she was known to her many friends. 

 Miss From was born in Fr0rup, Christians-felt, Denmark, on August 25, 

1875. Leaving Denmark     

 for America at the age of eighteen, she trained as a nurse and later won a diploma as a teacher from the International 

Montessori School. She    

 became the beloved teacher of the children of the Baldwin family of Hawaii for twenty-one years and in this period learned of the Faith though Elizabeth 

Muther.                   

 Long before she became a Baha, Frommie told of a wonderful dream she had in which she saw a marvellous golden name written against a blue sky. Years later she was to recognize the letters as those of The Greatest Name. When she became a IBahA'i she wept, for she said the Master had come to America (1912) and she knew nothing about Him until she came to Hawaii. 

 While she wept, a bell-clear voice said: "You can meet 'Abdu'l-Baha any time you wish in His 

Writings."                

 Frommie contributed greatly to the work of the Cause in Hawaii. She served as secretary of the Honolulu Spiritual Assembly for many

 years and was always the "steady rock" that acted as the balance during consultation. She is warmly remembered by the friends not oniy for her loving spirit and tireless effort on behalf of the Faith but for the many contributions her generous nature led her to make. She always donated generously whenever an emergency arose and greatly assisted the early struggles of the Hawaiian community. 

 A charming and cherished contribution is the beautiful little Japanese garden at the entrance to the }jazfratu'1-Quds. The bequest of Frommie's property in Manoa to the National Spiritual Assembly enabled Hawaii to fulfill another of the goals given by the Universal House of 

Justice.                   
                           
     CHARLOTTE GILLEN           

 1869 — 1962  

Charlotte Thomas ZuTavern  

 was born on July 10, 1869, in Springfield, Ohio. 

 Her early schooling in the Word of God was in the United Lutheran Church. 

 She began the study of music at the age of eight and taught professionally when she was twelve years old. 

 She studied at Boston Conservatory of Music and later headed the music department of Stetson University, Deland, Florida. 

 During that time she played the organ and directed the choir in the Baptist Church, then hurried across the street to do the same for the Presbyterian congregation. 

 These early activities set the pattern for her future. 

 In 1894 she married Richard Henry Gillen, M.D., and a daughter, Evelyn June, was born. The family moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1901 where Mrs. Gillen opened the Seattle School of Music which she conducted for twenty years and where she became active in civic affairs. It was in Seattle that she learned of the Baha'i movement from Mrs. Ida Finch, proprietress of an art supply shop, who oniy recently had been attracted by Mrs. Isabella D. Brittingliam, an early itinerant Baha'i teacher. Mrs. Finch sold her store and joined a party of early believers in San Francisco who came on pilgrimage to the Holy Land to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha  in prison. 

 During Mrs. Finch's absence, Charlotte attended an Easter sunrise service on the shores of Lake Washington. She arrived early, praying and thinking of Ida's experiences. 

 She later related that she felt her mind suddenly illuminated by the presence of the Creator and the unity of 

Jesus and Baha'u'llah.     

 Religion, which had always seemed like music to her, proper and natural, took on a new meaning. She had listened to the sermons of every persuasion  with an intellectual interest but she was now flooded with an awareness that the Baha pilgrims were experiencing the reality of living with God though obedience to His Manifestation  and His Covenant on earth! 

 God was for them a vitaiworking force in their lives, not a beautiful, vague idea! In that moment, Mrs. Gillen's acceptance of the Baha'i Faith crystallized and she devoted the rest of her life to teaching its truth. 

 In 1912 she and her sixteen-year-old daughter traveled to Chicago to experience the fullest moment of their lives in a private interview with 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 As part of the ceremony when the Master laid the foundation stone of the Mother Temple of the West, Charlotte turned a shovelful of earth in the name of Alaska. 

 After the death of her husband in 1916, Mrs. Gillen divided her time between her Seattle school and an apple orchard the family had planted on Lake Chelan in eastern Washington. The village of Chelan was to be her home for many years. It proved a sterile ground for teaching and the few who were attracted moved onto other places, but it served as a spot to rest and garner resources between teaching trips. 

 In 1919, in response to the Tablets of the Divine Plan, Charlotte traveled through Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, financially assisted by Ella Cooper. 

 She stopped in small towns, spoke to women's clubs, penitentiaries, where-ever  there were listeners. The high point of this trip, she records, was in giving the Message as guest speaker at the community New Year celebration in the rotunda of the new courthouse  in Boise, Idaho, and, with characteristic wit, she notes that the low point was country hotel bedbugs. 

 A Tablet from the Master dated October, 1919, addressed to Helen 

Goodall and Ella           

 Cooper, reached her on Christmas morning at 

Douglas, Wyoming:          

  "Convey to Mr. and Mrs. Killius, Mrs. Charlotte 

Gillen and Mr. Hyde Dunn   

 the utmost love and kindness on my behalf. On their behalf I address the following supplication:


<p342>
342                THE BAHA'I WORLD
     O     Thou Omnipotent Lord!

 These souls have given up their rest, their happiness, tlieir]oy, and their comfort, have left their (homes) in order to raise the call of Thy Kingdom upon the seas, the plains and the mountains. They are giving the Glad Tidings of Thy Manifestation, are bestowing sight to the eyes, hearing to the ears. They are unloosing the tongues, vivifying the dead and purifying the unclean. 0 Divine Providence! Be Thou their companion during their travels, for they are helpless and lonely and they are firm in Thy love. Thou art the Powerful and the 

Omnipotent."              

  Another Tablet from the Master dated June 21, 1921, was received, addressed "To the MaidServant of God, Charlotte Z. Gillen" which said in part: "0 Thou who art attracted to the Kingdom of God! 

 'Abdu'l-Baha's associate, day and night, is the mention and thought of the friends. Praise be to God, thou art striving in service; thou hast a pure heart, and art bestowed with a luminous souL No matter how much man may be sinful, yet divine pardon and forgiveness is greater than his sinfulness. Be thou confident in the infinite graces. The friends of God in those regions are the recl>ient of the di vine favors and the reflectors of the heavenly bounties. 

  During the long years in the conservative village of Lake Chelan, where she lived from 1916 until 1944, the Tablets of the Master were her solace. 

 During this time she played the organ for the Catholic mass at 9.00 am. and for the Episcopal service at 11.00 a.m. In those days women did not run orchards without assistance, nor attend university, nor entertain people of all races, nor discuss international affairs, nor develop friendships with persons from all walks of life, nor drive old rattling cars around dangerous mountain roads. Fortunately, the village's need for an organist was greater than its frustration and bewilderment at her nonconformist ideas and behavior. However, it was a place of deep loneliness. Charlotte missed contact with the Baha world. 

 There were few books, oniy carefully copied letters and Tablets. At the age of fifty-five  she enrolled at the University of Washington where she studied music and gave the Message for three years. She also attended Washington State Agricultural College during this period. Tn 1937 and 1938 she held two-day summer schools at her Chelan orchard, which were attended by approximately fifty 

Baha. The small Caucasian

 town had never before witnessed a gathering of different races united in the love of God. To her grandchildren who had often heard of but had not witnessed such a gathering, this scene, so familiar to most Baha'is, provided a wonderful, beautiful and lifelong memory. The friends gathered there, later scattered to the corners of the earth as they arose to take their places in history as pioneers in the Seven Year Plans, the Ten Year Crusade or the Nine Year Plan. 
   In 1942, during the first  

Seven Year Plan, Charlotte 

 made her first visit to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar since 1912. Two years later she sold her orchard, attended the Centenary 

Celebration in Chicago     

 and commenced a five-year teaching tour of the United States, remaining awhile in Arlington, Virginia, to maintain the Assembly there. 

 In 1950, in response to a call for home-front pioneers, she settled in Laramie, Wyoming  to maintain at nine the membership of the only Assembly in the State. At the age of eighty-one  she enrolled at the University of Wyoming in order to establish a Baha'i College Club and make contact with youth. It was here that she met one of the most beloved friends of.a long lifetime, the young music student, Daniel Jordan. 

 She was present at the dedication of the Temple in Chicago in 1953 and, leaving Wyoming, served during the next four years in Wenatchee and Monroe in Washington State where she created Baha'i centers. 

 In 1959, sustained by the Tablets addressed to her by the Master forty years earlier assuring her of divinepardon and companionship, urged on by her love of Shoghi Effendi and by the sorrow of his passing, deeply moved by the courage and loving guidance of the Hands of the Cause of God and determined to give every ounce of her own strength to serve the Faith she loved, Charlotte Gillen at ninety years of age attended the National Convention, visited Ohio, Indiana and Michigan to give a last greeting to relatives and set forth to that frontier  which had been the object of her love and prayers for many years, Alaska. 

 An Alaskan friend records: "Charlotte Gillen brought two special gifts to Alaska, a symbolic link with 'Abdu'l-Baha and an unparalleled  example of steadfast, determined


<p343>
IN MEMORIAM                 343

 service despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles. 

 She did much to infuse into the consciousness of the Alaskan Baha'is the personality  of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Ills ever-abiding presence. 

 She lost no opportunity in this endeavor. A Baha'i teasingly told her once that he knew of one place she had never been, the AbliA Kingdom. 'Oh, yes I have!' 
was her instant retort.    

 'The day I saw 'Abdu'l-Baha' "She imparted a measure of the private, intimate feelings of the friends when they lost their beloved 

Master in 1921. During     

 a meeting commemorating the Ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha, after reading aloud from God Passes By about the passing of the Master, she lowered the book, gazed off into the distance and recounted  those touching moments: 'I can remember it as if it were yesterday. 

 It was nine o'clock in the morning in San Francisco when the friends first got the word that 'Abdu'l-Baha had passed.' Then she related in moving terms the shock, the sense of loss and despair which swept over the believers. 

 "Aware of her unique role as the only Alaskan to have entered the presence of the Master she strived to pass on and preserve this link with the past. 

 She gave gifts of books to babies born of Baha parents so that 'they will have something from someone who knew 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 "She was candid and forthright and her indomitable spirit and restless energy were always directed to the service of the Cause. The hesitant, inactive or disobedient person was rarely comfortable in her presence. Her candid manner sometimes embarrassed the Baha and amused their friends, one of whom said, 'Oh, you Baha'is! Every time Grandma Gillen says something, you worry about how it's going to affect us!' But her candor disarmed them and brought them closer to the spirit of the 

Faith.                     

 "From Mrs. Gillen we learned the meaning of constancy. 

The well-meaning Baha'i    

 who, out of concern for Charlotte's advanced age suggested that it was no longer obligatory for her to fast, received a scolding: 'Young man, I've been fasting for fifty years and you're not going to stop me!' And he didn't. 

 "Her Civil War widow's pension was inadequate and her meager savings were being rapidly depleted. 

 It was a trembling delegation that visited her one day to suggest that the expenses and hardships of living in Alaska may 

     Charlotte Gillen           

  be too much for her. Alert to the dilemma of the friends, she eased the tension and soon had everyone laughing. Ste had pioneered for more than a year in the north. Her life's dream had been fulfilled and the pledge she had made to herself as a young woman to serve 'Abdu'l-Baha in Alaska had been redeemed. 

 She left contented  that she had done her part." 

 The spirit of Charlotte Gillen's entire life is sunm-ied up in the words she used, at the age of ninety, as she played with vitality for a group of singers, urging them to "Wake up! Wake up! Christ has returned! Sing your hearts out!" 
                           
       MARIAM HANEY               

 1872 — 1965 Mother Haney, as she was affectionately called in her later years by the great number of friends whose lives were influenced by her strong and loving guidance, was one of the precious early believers in America. 

 Born November 13, 1872, in New York City, Mrs. Haney's maiden name was 

Mary Ida                   
y


<p344>
344                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Parkhurst. After she embraced the Faith, the name "Mariam" was given her by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and was always used by her after this gift had been bestowed by the 

Master.                    

 At the age of twenty-one, she was united in marriage with an attorney, Charles Freeborn Haney. The year was 1893. The marriage of these two spiritually receptive souls took place in the very year that the Cause of Baha'u'llah was first mentioned in North 

America.                   

 Mr. and Mrs. Haney heard of the Faith in Chicago, in January 1900, through two American  believers, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Greenleaf, and they became Baha'is almost immediately. This contact with the Cause was the culmination  of years of questioning investigation and search for truth, which yielded them no convincing  answer until they came in contact with the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 
  From the outset of her     

Baha'i life Mariam Haney   

 became very active in serving the Faith. In those early days there was little Baha'i literature and the source of inspiration and encouragement to the friends was the flow of letters and Tablets from the beloved Master to the individual believers. 

 Mrs. Haney for many years acted as a clearinghouse for these precious  Tablets, reproducing them and circulating  them widely amongst the small but steadily growing band of followers of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 One of her first services of an international character in those early years was to accompany Mrs. Lua Getsinger, the great early American teacher of the Faith, to Paris, when Mrs. Getsinger at the instruction of 'Abdu'l-Baha journeyed to that city and had an audience with the ShAh of Persia, who was visiting Paris. The purpose of this interview was to plead for justice for the severely oppressed Baha'is in Persia and a halt to the endless persecution to which they were being subjected. 

 In February 1909 Mr. and Mrs. Haney had the bounty of a pilgrimage to 'Akka and spent nine days as guests of the Master in His home within the walls of the prison city. 

 Those never-to-be-forgotten days as the guest and student of 'Abdu'l-Baha were the highlight of Mrs. Haney's Baha life. 

 As a special gift she received  the Master's blessing on her unborn son, Paul, who would later be appointed a Hand of the Cause by the beloved 

Guardian.                  

 Stenographic notes of the utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha upon the occasions when 

Mr.                        
       Mariam Haney               

  and Mrs. Haney were in His holy presence were taken by Mrs. Haney, and subsequently these pilgrim's notes were published, at the instruction  of 'Abdu'l-Baha, under thetitle A Heavenly Feast. 

 After basking in the sunlight of the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Mariarn was almost consumed with grief as the days of her pilgrimage came to an end. On the final day the Master promised her that if she ever needed Him, He would be with her. In later years she often said that manytimes in herlife she did call upon Him and knew that He came to her assistance. 

As Mariam left His Holy    

 Presence she was able to hide her tears until she was safely aboard ship. Then there was no stopping them, she wept and wept. Later at home when she received the first letter from 'Abdu'l-Baha, He had written: "I was with you when you were weeping on the shjp." 

 The Haney family was residing in Washington,  D.C., in 1912 when the Master twice visited the capital city of the United States, and thus they had the bounty of participating in many of the events of His memorable sojourns there. 

 At the conclusion of 'Abdu'l-Baha's stay in


<p345>
IN MEMORIAM                345

 America, Mrs. Haney journeyed to New York to have one last glimpse of the Master she loved so completely and by Whose utterances she had set the course of her life. 

 The last spoken words of 'Abdu'l-Baha in America, when He addressed the friends who had gathered on board the S.S. Celtic on December 5, 1912, to bid Him farewell, were recorded stenographically by Mrs. Haney and comprise the final address published in The Promulgation of 

Universal Peace.          

 Following the death of Mr. Haney in Illinois in 1919, Mrs. Haney wrote to 'Abdu'l-Baha asking Him where He wished her to go with her son to best serve the Faith. 

 He instructed her to return to Washington, D.C. After attending the Annual 

Convention in April 1920  

 in New York City, Mrs. Haney proceeded to Washington and immediately, at the request of the Baha'i Temple Unity, at that time the governing body of the Faith in the United States, became the Secretary of the newly-established National Teaching Committee, serving in that capacityfor several years. This committee published a series of Bulletins reporting the news of teaching activities throughout the United States and Canada, and containing inspiring addresses and Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha This Bulletin was compiled and edited by Mrs. Haney. 

 In a Tablet addressed to her, the Master expressed Ills happiness at receiving this Bulletin and indicated that it was "very acceptable". 

 One of the foremost interests of Mrs. Haney throughout her Baha'i life was the interracial work to which she dedicated herself unceasingly.  She was a member of the con~rnittee of arrangements for the 

"First Convention for Amity

 between the Colored and White Races", held in Washington, D.C., in May 1921. This convention was called at the express instruction  of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and was the forerunner of many such gatherings held subsequently in different parts of the United States. 

 Mrs. Haney's love for this aspect of the teaching work of the Faith was deep, and to it she brought tremendous enthusiasm and awareness  of its supreme importance as stressed so often by the 

Master.                   
  From 1924 to 1935 Mrs.    

 Haney was the Associate Editor of the Baha'i magazine Star of the West and during this period also served on many national committees appointed by the 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 She was a member  of the Editorial Board which produced the first two volumes of The Baha'i World, the international periodical record of the worldwide  activities and progress of the Faith. 

 Throughout the remaining years of her life Mrs. Haney continued to serve the Faith by carrying on extensive correspondence with believers in different parts of the world, including pioneers, deepening them in the Teachings, sharing with them precious quotations from the Sacred Writings, and encouraging  them in their Baha activities. 

 In 1944, as the first Baha'i century drew to a close, the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States prepared for the occasion a centenary volume constituting the record of the response of the American believers to the call of Baha'u'llah. 

 The historical material on Baha'i teaching in North America appearing in this volume was prepared by Mrs. Haney at the request of the National Assembly. 

     Another servicewhich Mrs. 

 Haneycontinued to render in later years was the writing of "In Memoriam" articles for the successive volumes of The Baha'i World, particularly those commemorating  the lives and work of the early believers. 

 From the outset of their Baha'i lives, both Mr. and Mrs. Haney were blessed in receiving numerous Tablets from 'Abdu'l-Baha, encouraging  them in their services to the Cause of God and testifying to their steadfastness in the Covenant. 

 A few quotations from some of the Tablets addressed to Mrs. Haney seem appropriate to this memorial: 

     "He is God!               

 0  thou dear maidservant of the Blessed

     "He is God!                

 o thou who art firm in the Covenant! 
     Thy letter was received.   

 Its entire content was the utmost of supplication and invocation toward the 

Kingdom of Abhd. Truly     

 I say thy respected husband, Mr. Haney, and thyself — both of you are firm and faithful, and are servants of the Kingdom of Baha'u'llah. You have no other aim except the goodpleasure of God, and are longing for the realization of no other hope except servitude at the Divine Threshold. 

 lam pleased with both of you." 

   "He is God!                

 o thou who art attracted by the breaths of the Holy Spirit: Thy letter was received. The text and the meanings were proof of firmness and steadfastness in the Cause of the Glorious Lord;. 
     "0 thou leaf of the Blessed

Tree!                      
     Thy letter was received.   

 Although thou hast encountered great difficulties, and wert afflicted with violent trials, yet,praise be to God, that thou art patient and thankful, and art engaged in the praise and glorification of the Forgiving Lord. 

 Thou art not downhearted, but art free. Thou art not complaining, but offering thanks to the Lord. 

 Thou art not lamenting andsighing, but art spendingthydaysin the utmo.stjoyandfragrance. This is the characteristic of every assured believer. 

 When man becomes firm and steadfast in faith — during the days of ordeal — he is long-~uffering  and thankful; and while he enjoys composure and tranquility, he is a loyal servant. Praise be to God that thou belongest to this class. 

  Following the ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Mrs. Haney gave to the beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, from the very outset of his ministry the same quality of devotion and complete  obedience which had characterized her relationship to the Master. During these thirty-six years she was blessed by receiving fromthe Guardian agreatmanyletters, guiding and encouraging her in her services to the Faith. Many of these letters conveyed also beautiful and moving expressions of appreciation  of her labors for the advancement of the Cause. Space does not permit the inclusion of any wide selection from those precious communications. 

 However, the words addressed to her by Shoghi Effendi in his own handwriting early in 1957, only a few months before his passing, are indicative of the bounties he bestowed upon her and the esteem in which he held this devoted pioneer of the Faith in 

America:                   

 "May the Almighty bless your efforts, guide and sustain you always, and aid you to enrich the record of your unforgettable services to His Faith." 

     When the Universal House   

 of Justice was informed of Mrs. Haney's passing on September  1, 1965, that Supreme Body immediately sent a beautiful cable to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, the text of which provides a befitting conclusion to this memorial:

  "Glory to Thee, 0 my God! 

 But for the tribulations which are sustained in Thy path, how could Thy true lovers be recognized, and were itnotfor the trials which are borne for love of Thee, how could the station of such as yearn for Thee be revealed?" 

  The above words from the Pen ofBah~'u'11Th and those which conclude this account, best describe the brief life of Sayyid Ilasan who suffered greatly in his love for the Cause, and in his twenty-eighth year chose death so that his longing soul might find joy and reunion at the Threshold of the Beloved in the spiritual world. 

 Born in Needeh, a village near Sukij in upper Egypt, Sayyid Ijasan established himself in Cairo where, in 1964, he first accepted the Faith through one of his relatives from Suh~j who also lived in Cairo. 
In turn, Mr. Ijasan


<p347>
IN MEMORIAM                 347

       Sayyidljasan               

  shared the message with his young wife who quickly embraced it, and together they looked forward to a life of active service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 In 1965 Mr. IJasan and his wife and six-month-old daughter were among those arrested and imprisoned in a wave of persecution directed against the Baha community and accused of religious heresy, political subversion and high treason. During the interrogation Mr. Itlasan was required to write a report about his involvement in the Baha'i Faith. Fearlessly he wrote at the top of the report, in large capital letters, "A11Ah-u-AbhA!" 

 In searching his person the authorities found a short Baha'i prayer which they seized as evidence and concerning which they questioned him. Unflinchingly  he answered that the prayer was engraved on his heart and could not be effaced. 

 The investigation continued for four days during which the child became ill and required medical attention which was denied. Sleeping on the floor of the prison worsened the child's condition. 

 The attempts of the mother to invoke the kindness of the chief officer to assist her ailing child were greeted by brutal unkindness. Powerless to assist, Mr. ilasan was forced to witness the inhuman treatment of his wife and child in complete patience and utter surrender to God. On the fourth day his wife and baby were released. In the night, the child died. 

 On the following day Mr. Ijasan was released on bail, while some others were sentenced to prison. 

 He returned to his home to find his infant daughter dead. His wife had been taken to their home village by her brother who was also the cousin of Mr. Ijasan. 

He encouraged Mr. Ijasan   

 to follow his wife to the village where an atmosphere of intolerance, bigotry and fanaticism prevailed. 

 In an effort to make him recant his faith, the villagers set upon Mr. Ijasan, beating and torturing him. lie was spat upon, scoffed at, wounded about the head by a blade, throttled, and driven through the village in outworn clothing amid the hateful shouts and curses of the mob. Not a single word of complaint was uttered by Mr. Ijasan and he endured the indignity and excruciating pain with the God-intoxicated tranquillity that characterizes the martyr who esteems suffering in the path of service a demonstration of fidelity.  Joyfully, triumphantly, his voice rang out above the noise of the crowd: "Y& BahA'u'1-AbhA!" 

 Failing in their attempts to force him to recant his faith, the authorities contrived a forced divorce between the couple, the wife being required to remain in the village. 

 Mr. Ijasan returned to the desolating loneliness of Cairo. Grieved by the death of his child, deprived of the solace of his wife's companionship, rejected by his kin and townspeople,  and living in a danger-fraught situation inwhichtheBahA'is wereforbidden to associate with each other, the young man surrendered to the irresistible impulse to seek the release of his spirit into the next world, and so died by his own hand on July 16, 1965. 

 Despite the blighting difficulties that beset her, his wife has remained firm and steadfast, accepting persecution and loss with deep spiritual content. 

 She still lives at her home village, virtually a semi-prisoner, and refusing all offers for remarriage. 

 "Thy might beareth me witness! The companions of all who adore Thee are the tears they shed, and the comforters of such as seek Thee are the groans they utter, and the food of them who haste to meet Thee is the fragments of their broken hearts.

      LUCAS HILLANES            

  With the passing of Lucas ilillanes in July, 1965, the Baha'i community of Bolivia lost one of its most active and outstanding native Indian teachers. 

 Before embracing the Baha Cause he was known in his home community of Jancarachi, Province of Alonzo de Ibafiez, as a profoundly spiritual man. It was his habit to go into the mountains to pray, to cross his hands and turn his face to the Almighty beseeching His blessings.  He did notlike to cheat orlie. 

 His constant search for the spirit of truth was one of his distinguishing characteristics which was often the cause of misunderstanding and suspicion among his neighbors. 

 Mr. Hillanes' spiritual yearnings were fulfilled when he learned of and accepted the Baki'i Faith. 

 He wholeheartedly dedicated his life to its service, sponsoring meetings in his home community and voluntarily accompanying traveling teachers to the villages of the area. In time his health declined and his activities were curtailed, but he continued to use the BaWt'i prayers until his passing. 

 As the Baha gathered for a training course in the community of Totoroco the news reached them of the loss of their coworker. Mrs. Hillanes walked four leagues (approximately twelve miles) to tell the Baha'i friends of the passing of her husband. Prayers were immediately  offered for the progress of his radiant soul on its homeward journey.

      ALETHE HOLSAPPLE HOGBERG  

 1897 — 1966 Eight months short of seventy years was the life span of Alethe Holsapple 

H6gberg. The Baha Faith  

 was the influence from the beginning of Alethe's long, productive life. 

Her gand-mother,  Leonora 

 Stirling, who raised Alethe, was one of the earliest American Baha'is. 

 With her husband, Carl Siqurd, who became a Baha'i in 1948, Alethe established the first Spiritual Assembly of Tnglewood Judicial District, California. In 1953 they volunteered to pioneer to Sweden but these plans did not materialize. Instead they remainedin California where Alethe became known as "The Secre-ta~",  serving in this capacity a Local 

Assembly, the Regional    

 Teaching Committee and the Committee for the Blind, In 1956 the Hogbergs pioneeredto Auburn, California, which formed its assembly in 1957. 

 A second attempt to pioneer to Sweden was successful in June, 1960. While Sweden was Carl's native land, to Alethe it meant a new language, new friends, and a new way of life. Her knowledge of English and the Baha Writings was of special value as she assisted in the translation of Gleanings 

From the Wriringsof Baha'u'llah

 and Balzd'iPrayers into new Swedish  editions. 

 She helped in the teaching work in the way she favored best, working quietly in the background in a constant spirit of service. 

 With the death of her husband in 1962, she felt the additional frustrations of one alone in a foreign land with meagre command of the language. Leaving Sweden, Alethe arrived in Kodiak, Alaska, to assist once more in the formation of a "first" Local Assembly and again she became the secretary. 

 In 1963 Alethe resumed her career as a social worker in Auburn, California. 

 She was actively teaching and formulating exciting plans: retirement — a trip to Brazil to visit her sister whom she had not seen since 1934 and whom she had at times deputized during her forty years of pioneering — pilgrimage—  a return  to Sweden — on to Norway — perhaps to resettle in Scandinavia. 

 These dreams ended in Auburn in June, 1966, when an automobile accident released her soul from the cage of her body. 

 Her soul is freed; her spirit lives in the hearts of those who knew and loved her; and her service continues though a most fitting memorial — the devoted services of her daughter, son-in-law and two granddaughters.

of GhAzi-'AntAb, Turkey.  

JinTh-i ChaiN Effendi     

 went to Egypt in 1872 during the Turko-Russian wars to visit his uncle and, during his four-year stay in Egypt, he embraced the Faith. After his return to his homeland he was the cause of enrolling his relatives and many others.

     Majdu'd-Din Indn           

  JinAb-i Majdi fn~n successfully completed his studies in the schools of Rushdiyyih, and then at the American College in Ghdzi-'AntAb and thus acquired fluency in the Persian, Arabic and 

English languages. From    

 the beginning he revealed much interest in reading and translating  the Baha'i 

Writings.                  

 At the beginning of World War I, during his last years of college, he was called for military service and sent to Palestine. 

 While there he requested permission to travel to Haifa and succeeded in visiting 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 During his visit the Master prayed for him and said "God willing, they will not send you to Beersheba." Later he was informed that all his friends had been sent tofleersheba where they were ailkilled. 

 JinAb-f Majdi In~n became a target of persecution in IYrfi He was tried by a military court but was acquitted. It was no longer feasible for him to remain in Ghgzi-'AntTh so he moved to Istanbul and worked as a translator and served as secretary of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly.                  

 In 1930 during an outbreak of hostility directed against the Baha'is he was arrested and brought to trial, but he was well defended and won an acquittal. On another occasion he was pursued but was freed without trial. 

 Mr. Majdi Jn~n married in 1926 and four children were born to him, ills three Sons predeceased  him but he is survived by his daughter. He passed away in 1967 after a lengthy period of illness. 

 In addition to serving on administrative bodies on both the local and national level Mr. Jn&n performed invaluable services in the field of translation. His translations of many of the most important 

Writings of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha

 and Shoghi Effendi will keep the memory of his services alive for generations. 
                           
    YADU'LLAH KARIMiI          

 19 15 — 1966 Though UAJi Asad, a devoted Shaykhi, prepared  the people of his native Says&n, in the remote seclusion of A4hirbAyjAn, in Persia, for the appearance of the Promised One even prior to the Advent oftheBAb, itwasnotuntildecades later, when Baha'u'llah was immured in the fortress-prison of 'Akka, that the descendants of these people heard of, and embraced, His divine Cause. Having accepted it, they clung to it with such tenacity that nothing could shake their faith. 

 None of the guileful machinations that a cunning foe could devise — no propaganda of vilification over a broadcasting system specially contrived for that purpose; no allurement  of pomp and power by association with the Establishment in the erection of a massive mosque; not even intimidation and threats to their lives — could succeed in undermining their belief or dampening their ardour. 

 Infuriated at their failure to win back the Baha'is by these means to the Muslim fold, the priests — headed by one of deeply evil intent —  inflamed the passions of the mob and urged action. 

 Anyone who arose to carry out their behests was promised full support for any deed he perpetrated and total immunity from its consequences. 

 BAIA KMn responded to this call. He prevailed on two ruffians to assault Yadu'llAh Karimi, born of Baha'i parents, who had lived in SaysAn all his life. He was fifty-one years of age at this time, married, with seven children. They chose to make an example of him because of his ardent devotion, his unflagging loyalty, his unwavering steadfastness. 

 The opposition he encountered served but to intensify the

    Yadu'lldJi Kailmi          

  fervour of his longing for sacrifice that he had always cherished in his heart. 

 As no threat could make him recant his belief, they beat him to death. 

 It was on the 25th day of December 1966, that our beloved brother laid down his life for our precious Cause. 

 The local physician, biased against the Baha'is, specified the cause of death in the certificate he issued, as heart failure. The SaysAn friends, however, questioned the validity of this document and, in consequence, Yadu'11Th's body was taken to Tabriz for an autopsy. The ensuing report confirmed that his death was due to internal injuries caused by heavy blows dealt by some blunt instrument on his head and body and a warrant issued for the apprehension of the murderers. The body of our martyred brother was then taken back to Says~n and accorded a befitting Baha'i burial in the presence of the local believers and some police officers. 

 To round off their nefarious deed, the miscreants smashed the windowpanes of the new mosque in broad daylight before a crowd of Muslim and Baha onlookers and laid it to the charge of nine Baha'is. Accused of vandalism, these nine were each sentenced to six months' imprisonment and a heavy fine. Their sentence was confirmed at the retrial that was ordered. 

  GIIULAM-UUSAYN KAYVAN      

  ChulAm-Husayn Kayv&n was born in TibrAn where he received his formal education and mastered the French language in addition to Persian and Arabic. 

 Succeeding his father, Ism6iii KMn Sartip ~hayb~ni in the service of the fr~nian 

Ministry of Post, Telegraph

 and Telephone, he soon attained fame and rank because of his native intelligence and his frank and independent character. 

 In his youth he was interested in politics. His exceptional talents and his outspoken and courageous discussions with political leaders of the newly-established constitutional government of IrAn made him a popular companion and colleague of those leaders. However, his overwhelming passion for truth and his quest for knowledge caused him to lose patience with their vacillations and partisan manceuvres and he soon broke awayfrom ailpolitical affiliation. 

 During this period of uncertainty and disappointment he made the acquaintance of ArbTh Siy~vash a devoted 

Baha of Zoroastrian      

 origin. Arb6b Siy~va~h was by no means erudite, but he possessed the blessed gift of unaffected sincerity and a heart burning with the desire to serve his beloved Faith. Finding Mr. KayvAn a pure and righteous soul earnestly in search of truth, he began telling him about the Faith in his own simple language and reciting passages from the Baha'i Writings with much force and fervour. 

Increasingly Mr. Kayv&n    

 grew impressed by the Tablets he had studied and the sincerity of his teacher. As he related afterwards, he marvelled at the power that could cause a Zoroastrian to learn quotations  from the Qur'an in order to convince a Muslim of the divine origin and authenticity of this new revelation. 

 Mr. Kaywin subsequently met other Baha'i teachers including Ij4ji Abu'1-Ijasan Amin, Dr. Araspi KhAn 

Hakim and ~hayk~ Mubam-mad 
IbrAhim F~PJi1-i Shfr6A    

 and was profoundly  affected and transformed though contact with these venerable souls. He was especially influenced by F&Ji1 who possessed outstanding spiritual qualities and was also a wellknown theologian and mystic. 

 Mr. Kayvftn, his mother and two of his five sisters embraced the Faith and became sincere and steadfast servants of the Cause of God. 

 Mr. Kayv~n traveled in Europe and while in

  Ghuldm-Husayn Kay vein England mastered the English language. It was during this period that he twice visited the Holy Land and was so captivated by the Guardian that he returned to his own country completely galvanized and determined to devote his whole life to the service of the Cause. 

 In spite of his official position he was proud of his service as a Baha'i and, heedless of the intrigues of the envious, he used his vast knowledge and remarkable  capacity in teaching the message of Baha'u'llah to his countrymen. Even when his enemies succeeded in making him retire on a meagre pension, he joyously welcomed the opportunity of devoting all his time to the service of his beloved Faith, translating, teaching  or speaking in Baha'i meetings. On behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly of Inin he spent almost a year supervising the construction  of the tomb of the Hand of the Cause of God Keith Ransom-Kehier, in IsfdMn. 

 In 1954, despite his advanced age, he arose to participate in the Ten Year Crusade, setting out on a journey to Africa to visit pioneers. 
In consultation with the  

National Spiritual Assembly

 of North West Africa, he settled down in Kenitra, Morocco. There he lived alone in a hotel, contenting himself with very little material comfort and devoting his time and effort to the service of God. Toward the end of his life he attended the Great Jubilee in London and returned to his goal town spiritually  jubilant and determined to rededicate himself to his pioneering work. 

 He spent the remaining months of his life in the city where he had helped create a strong Baha'i community whose strength was demonstrated by the steadfast  Moroccan friends who were imprisoned and condemned to death because of their adherence  to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 He died in 1965 and, because of certain problems encountered in Kenitra, was buried in the Baha'i cemetery in Rabat, where already a number of Persian pioneers are buried. 
                          
   MIRZA ALI-KULI KHAN       
  1879(?) — April 7, 1966     

  Mirza Ali-Kuli Khan was born about 1879 in KAshTh, Persia, into a family which traces its genealolgy to King Nawshfrv4n the Just. His father, Mirza 'Abdu'r-Rahim KhTh Zarnibi moved to Tihr&n in 1880, becoming Mayor (Kalaintar) of that city. The youth was educated at the ShAh's Royal College, specializing in French and English. When the Mayor, aBah&f, died, Khan was fourteen or fifteen, took tutoring  and translating positions and at seventeen was translator of foreign publications in the Secretariat of the Prime Minister. 

 Becoming a Baha some years later, with two friends he wandered across Persia, dressed as a dervish, and teaching his new religion, often at considerable  risk. 

 Drawn by his love for 'Abdu'l-Baha he then left TibrAn, secretly and without resources, and spent arduous months sleeping on floors and traveling steerage to reach the Holy Land in the spring of 1899. Having served the Master well over a year as amanuensis, he was sent by Him to the United States as interpreter to the great Baha'i philosopher, Mirza Abu'1-Fajl, arriving in 1901. The following year Khan became secretary to the Persian Minister at Washington, D.C., and in 1904 married Florence Breed1 of Lynn and Boston. 

 The couple had thee children, Rahim, Marzieh and }Taniiideh. 

 With his wife and infant son, Khan made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1906, going on 1 The Baha'i World, vol. xu, p. 703.

  to Persia and returning as Consul to the United States. 

In 1907, when Persia      

 was in a state of crisis and looking to various European countries  for help, Khan decisively intervened in favor of American assistance, and was accordingly  instructed by his government to seek technical and financial aid in the United States. In 1910 — 1911, he was Chief 

Diplomatic Representative 

 and Charg6 d'Affaires in Washington.' 

  Always a patriot, Khan's  

 aim was the same as that expressed by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1912: "...establishing a perfect bond between Persia and 

America." (The Promulgation

 of Universal Peace, VoL I, p. 32.) In 1912 Khan was able to receive 'Abdu'l-Baha in a befitting manner at the Persian Legation in Washington, bringing leading Americans into the Master's presence and translating a number of His addresses, one of them the farewell address on board the Celtic. 

 When, at the suggestion of President Wilson, Persia sent a Peace Delegation to the Versailles Conference, Khan was a member, he and his party traveling to France on a transport as guests of the United 

States.                   

  See the references in 

W. Morgan Shuster The     
Strangling of             

Persia.                   

 With the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary, Khan later headed the Persian Embassy at Istanbul. From 1921 to 1923 he was Chief Minister of the Crown Prince Regent's Court in TibrAn, and was later appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the Five Republics of the Caucasus. One of oniy a handful of Baha'is in the Diplomatic Corps, he then retired to private life. 

 In continual touch with the Guardian as he had been with the Master, he had the honor of serving the youthful Shoghi Effendi (en route to Oxford) in Paris, and of another pilgrimage to Haifa in 1924. 

 Khan's state title, Nabilu'd-Dawlih, was conferred on him in 

1911 by Abmad ShAh. Among 
his decorations are the   

Gold Decoration  of Learning

 with honorary Ph.D., the Lion and Sun Class I, and Persia's highest order, the 'Timth6i' which bears the SiPh's portrait. 

 A member of the National Spiritual Assembly  of the United States in 1925 and 1926, his name appears in the Declaration of Trust. He served on a number of Local Assemblies, including  New York, Washington and Los Angeles, and spoke from countless public platforms, including early talks on the Baha'i Faith for the Harvard classes of philosopher William James. 

 His eloquence was almost proverbial: the press reported how he once, in New York, delayed the sailing of an ocean liner, at high tide, when a traveling Persian dignitary was late. Confirming many souls in the Faith, he taught from the deep philosophical  grounding received from the Master and Mirza Abu'1-FaKII. 

 Khan's Baha'i translations include many Tablets, an early version of the 

Iqan, The Seven Valleys   

 and the Four Valleys, and The Baha'i Proofs. 

 Never to be compared with the magnificent later renditions by the Guardian, these provisional translations were vitally needed in the Occident at that time. 

 As yet another service to the union of East and West, he brought to the United States a number of Persian students, including his Baha'i brother's two sons, 'AbbAs-Kuli and Allah K. Kalantar, and a niece, Baha'u'llah, the first Persian woman ever to be received at the White House. 

 The last decade and a half of Khan's life was spent mostly in Washington.

  In another communication to the National Spiritual 

Assembly on December      

 13, 1967, the Universal House ofJustice assured the believers that "her services will never be effaced from the records of the Kingdom". 

 This precious and esteemed servant of Baha'u'llah was born in Qazvin into a Baha'i family of Zoroastrian origin. In her childhood she was mentioned in the Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed to the Zoroastrian believers. He prayed for her promising future. 

 Mrs. Khusravi attended the Baha'i Girls' School of Qazvin and while obtaining her secondary education in Rasht contracted tuberculosis of the backbone which confined her to bed for years. While convalescing she continued her study of the BaWi'i Teachings. 

 In response to her request for prayers the beloved Guardian wrote to her on February 25, 1938, expressing his sympathy and assuring her of his prayers for her complete recovery. 

 Her health regained, Mrs. Kliusravi undertook  travel teaching trips in Qazvin and Zanjdn, encouraged by the Hand of the Cause of God Abi%'1-Q~sim Faizi and Mr. Jshr~q Khdvari. Her foreign pioneering services commenced in 1941 when she arose with the first throng of pioneers to

 from her post in 'frAq by the hostile actions of the authorities against Irdnian Baha'is she returned to Persia and at the request of the National Spiritual Assembly commenced her services with the Baha'i youth in ArAk, SultAn-AMd. 

 In 1951 she again pioneered abroad, this time to Kuwait, and there married Mr. Khusraw Khusravi theirs being the first Baha marriage to take place after the establishment of the Spiritual Assembly of Kuwait. Since its inception  in 1957 Mrs. Kihusravi was active in formulating the programmes of the Baha'i Summer School of Arabia and served as a teacher of courses on Acquiring Baha'i Attributes and other subjects. 

 Despite local social difficulties and the restrictions on the freedom of women in the area, Mrs. Khusravi made many journeys to visit various Baha'i centres and isolated friends, by whom she is warmly remembered for her gallant example, sage advice and helpful instruction.  Her understanding of the significance of pioneering, her loving admonishments and her outstanding hospitality won her many friends among the Baha youth of Arabia. 

    In 1958 dear Farkhundih   
was happy to attend the   

Frankfurt Conference      

 and in 1963 she travelled to London to attend the 

World Congress.           
     At Rijvtin 1967 Mrs. Khusravi

 was elected Secretary of the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Arabia. In    

 the same year she travelled with her husband and two daughters to visit her father, mother, brother and sister, pioneers in Morocco. On the return journey Mrs. Khusravi was killed in a motor accident near IskandarOn,

 Turkey on September 9, 1967. Her husband and two daughters were oniy slightly injured. The dear friends and pioneers in Iskandanin were a great comfort to the bereaved husband and to the two little daughters, Nura and Lewa, aged fourteen and eleven respectively. 

 Schooled by her early suffering perhaps, Farkhundih KNnum possessed the quality of patience in an outstanding measure and the capacity to forgive those who sought to hurt her. No unkind word or thoughtless deed disturbed  the deep spiritual tranquillity that surrounded her life. Through her untimely death the Baha of Arabia have lost a true sister. 
                           
   SUSAN GOLDEN KILFORD       

 1883 — 1967 Miss Susan Golden Kilford, our beloved "Killie", at the age of eighty-four, passed to the AbhA Kingdom on October 6, 1967, after a very brief illness. Only a few months previously, she had fulfilled her longing to make the pilgrimage to the Holy Land. 

 Killie first heard of the Faith in 1923 and had been a Baha'i for over forty years. She knew Dr. Esslemont personally and entertained, amongst other visitors, Martha Root when the latter visited the Bournemouth area. 

 She lived five years at the nursing home, named RhJv6n by Shoghi Effendi, of Sister Grace Challis at Broadstone, and was a member of that early Bournemouth Assembly on which Sister Challis, Miss Florence Pinchon, and Miss May Cheesman also served. 

 Tn 1935 Killie spent five months in the United States and Canada and there met many of the early American believers whose illustrious names are now household words throughout the Baha'i world. 

 She attended the two-day Congress held in the Foundation Hall of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Wilmette, upon the completion of' the clerestory of that edifice. She was asked to speak on the progress of the Faith in England, and was perhaps the first Baha of Britain to speak in the Mother Temple of the West. 

 Returning in January 1936, Killie settled in London, became a member of the 

London Spiritual Assembly  
and served on various committees.

 She also served as hostess at the London Baha'i Centre open daily to enquirers. In 1954, when she was over seventy years of age, Killierespondedto the call of the Guardian for Baha'is to settle in Cathedral cities and selected Winchester as her goal. Mter working there alone for two or three years the Faith became firmly established and in 1962, before the conclusion of the Ten Year Crusade, the Spiritual Assembly of Winchester was formed. 

 Killie was a source of love and inspiration to everyone. 

 We shall miss her but know that she must be serving even more happily in the 

AbIa~ Kingdom.             
                           
      MARGARET LENTZ             

 1879 — 1965 Margaret was born in Cuxhaven, Germany, where she had a carefree, happy youth in a well-situated  family. 

 The First World War caused her to search for a deeper sense of life and after many years of disappointment her longing was finally fulfilled and Margaret was introduced to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Here she found her real home. Soon after she joined the radiant spiritual army of the Blessed Beauty she received  permission for a pilgrimage to the Most Holy Places of her new religion and to meet Shoghi Effendi, so much loved by her. These days were the highlights of her new life, and forty years later she still could refresh the spirit of young and old believers with her accounts of her experiences in the Holy Land. 

 After returning from the Holy Land she offered her services in all fields of Baha'i work and soon went to Geneva where she served together with Anne Lynch for many years in the International Baha'i Bureau as one of the most talented assistants of Emogene lloagg.1 These years in Geneva were the ones which deepened her still more firmly in the Cause, and Margaret developed outstanding qualities of absolute firmness in the Covenant, and strict and always immediate obedience to the call of the beloved Guardian. 

     When the Ten Year World    
Crusade started, Margaret  

 offered to pioneer in Germany, but the German 

National Spiritual Assembly
asked her to serve in Austria.

 Immediately she obeyed The Baha'i World, vol. x, p. 520.


<p355>
IN MEMORIAM

      Margaret Lentz             

  and went to Vienna where she was one of the very first pioneers after the Second World War — and this was exactly the place where she was most needed. Her keen and most delightful sense of humour, her fwmness in the Covenant, her deep and unfailing love for 

Shoghi Effendi             

 — these outstanding qualities were a source of attraction to the friends of that long-deprived community. 

 Together with the first Austrian believer, dear Franz P Ollinger, and the newly-arrived  pioneers from Persia, they reestablished the Baha'i work in that country. 

 After the purchase of the Ija4ratu'1-Quds in the Thimiggasse 1 2she became the "house-mother" for many years, much loved by all the friends and guests. 

 When she was eighty-three years old Margaret  broke her hipbone. During this period the book Thi ef in the Night by the Hand of the Cause of God William Sears became the focus of her life. 

 Thee days before the accident occurred this popular publication was received by the National Spiritual Assembly. Margaret avidly read the book and immediately decided to translate it. When she went to hospital with her broken hip, her only wish was to obtain enough paper to continue her translation work. When finally she was able to leave the hospital 355 she still was unable to sit up, but preferred to stand, and so she built herself a writing table out of several trunks and could thus continue with her translation by standing before her self-made writing table nearly the whole day long. Sometime before the conclusion of the Ten 

Year Teaching Crusade      

 Margaret finished  her German translation of Thief in the Night. 

   Soon afterwards Margaret's 
health failed considerably.

 She could no longer stay in the busy Ija4ratu'1-Quds, so she went to a private old people's home in Klosterneuburg, near Vienna, where she opened one of the so-much-needed localities of the Plan. 

 Until her end Margaret was a tireless worker in the Baha'i Faith and a constant source of pleasure and joy to everyone.

   ANNE SLASTIONA LYNCH       

 1892 — 1966 With the passing of Anne Lynch, a unique and beautiful chapter of service to the Baha'i Faith came to an end, in this world, to add its lustre to the immortal annals of the followers of Baha'u'llah. 

 Born in Russia in December 1892, Anne fled her home at the end of World War Ito settle in England. 
She first heard of the     

Baha'i Faith in Italy      

 in 1926 from Mrs. Loulie Mathews, accepted it immediately, and spent the remainder of her life in service to Baha'u'llah, giving unstintingly of her capabilities and talents. 

 After a visit of several months' duration to the Guardian in the Holy Land early in her Baha'i life, she went to Geneva to help in the work of the International Baha'i Bureau, and later became its head. Her services in this post, which were directly under the guidance and supervision of the Guardian, were to last continuously until 1957 when the specific functions  of the International Bureau had been fulfilled. 

 At the request of Shoghi Effendi, Mrs. Lynch remained at her post in Geneva throughout World War H, sending out from that centre news of the growth of the Faith and encouragement to the friends in the wartorn countries of Europe. 

 She was thus enabled to help and


<p356>
356                THE BAHA'I WORLD
   Anne Slastiona Lynch       

  comfort those who sorely needed contact with their Baha'i world family. 

 Mrs. Lynch's extraordinary aptitude for languages made her services to her beloved Faith particularly valuable. She was completely fluent in Russian, French, English, German, Italian and Esperanto. 

 Some of the important translations and publications produced during her years at the 

International IBahA'i      
Bureau are: The Hidden     
Words (Russian — 1933); Baha'u'llah
and the New Era (revised   

German —  1939 — 1946); Baha'u'llah

 and the New Era (Zan-ienhof translation — Polish). In addition she was responsible for the translation and printing of a number of news bulletins into various languages including the European publication News Exchange in English, beginning  in 1945. The latter is referred to by Shoghi Effendi in his message The Challenging Requirements  of the Present Hour. In the period 1945 —  1948 she published and distributed a bulletin in Esperanto. 

 With the establishment of twelve National Spiritual 

Assemblies in Western      

 Europe the specific functions of the International DahA'i Bureau and of the office of the European Teaching Committee, which had worked in close cooperation under the direction of the Guardian, came to an end and the Cause of God in Europe was launched on a new phase of development. 

 With this work completed Anne, for the first time in her life, found the opportunity  to fulfil her cherished desire to serve as a pioneer for the Faith. Although frail and failing in health, she set forth on a new adventure, a new path of service, which she trod until her death, pioneering in Neuchatel, Vevey and several other places around Lake Geneva. 

 She would often speak of 'Abdu'l-Baha's words as He looked across Lake Geneva during his visit to Thonon: "There is much work to be done around this lake." It gave her great joy to take an active part in the pioneer work which 'Abdu'l-Baha said should be done. Her profound knowledge of the Teachings, her many years of experience and her wisdom contributed to her success as an outstanding teacher. 

 Until her last days on this earth, she continued to serve her Faith with an exemplary zeal, selfless devotion, steadfastness and courage which are her priceless legacy to those who follow after. 
    In a letter from Shoghi    

Effendi dated October      

 28, 1945, is found a fitting tribute with which to conclude: "This is to assure you again of my abiding gratitude for, and appreciation of, your splendid  services to our beloved Faith, despite the formidable obstacles you have encountered. The Beloved is well pleased with you, and will abundantly reward you for your perseverance, your devotion, your loyalty, and zeal in His service. 

 Rest assured, and neverlose heart. lam continually praying for you and your dear coworkers in that land. Persevere and be happy.~~

Feliciano Mamani, a Bolivian

 Indian of Negro-Kayma, Poop6 Province, was noted for his high sense of honesty and integrity. 

 He had an inquiring mind and had eagerly searched for truth, a quest which was rewarded when he embraced the Baha Faith in 1960. 

 He immediately  arose to teach his neighbors and volunteered his services as a traveling teacher.


<p357>
IN MEMORIAM                 357

 The believers of his community could not read or write. 

 Through the efforts of Mr. Mamani a small private boys school was established in Negro-Kayma which functioned for three years. 

 He obtained the use of a building  for the holding of classes and maintained the teacher. The pupils memorized Baha'i prayers and songs and were taught the history of the Central Figures of the Faith. Literacy classes were conducted for adults who learned to read. Drawings and visual-aids were used in teaching them about the Baha Faith. 

 One of the boys who attended the school went on to become a literacy teacher in 

Dejahuta.                  
    Whenever possible Mr.      
Mamani attended Baha'i     

 meetings and conferences, always eager to increase his knowledge of the Faith. In 1962 he attended the National Conference in Sucre, returning to his home community on foot, a journey lasting nine days. He spent the nights in the mountains and taught in villages along the way. He reached Negro-Kayma in a weakened condition due to lack of food. Although his health was affected he continued teaching and receiving visitors in his home, until he fell ill on one of his journeys and, after a brief stay in hospital, passed away on May 11, 1966. With quiet dignity his wife now carries on the work her husband commenced and to which he gave his life, teaching her children the verities of the Baha'i Cause so that it may be the star of guidance to their lives.

 1905 — 1968  

     JEAN MANY BEARS            

 19 10 — 1968 The Many Bears learned of the Faith from Dr. Arthur Irwin and his wife, Lily Ann, and accepted  it in October 1961, the first Canadian Indians of the Blackfoot tribe to become Baha'is. They immediately became active in carrying the Faith to others of the Blackfoot tribe and their determination and enthusiasm contributed greatly to the formation, at RigivAn 1962, of the Spiritual Assembly of the Blackfoot Reserve, near Calgary, Alberta. 

    Edmund Many Bears          

  Edmund was a recognized leader among the Blackfoot people, as his father had been before him, and was accorded the courtesy title of Chief. He had served actively on the Indian Band Council and in a tribal organization called the Brave Dog Society. 

 By occupation he was a farmer and although he had little formal education he had a thirst for knowledge and a deep desire to improve the condition of his people. 

In the Baha'i Teachings    

 he found a solution to the depressed state of his people and a heightened understanding of the spiritual capacity and noble station of man. 

 Edmund and his wife, Jean, were instrumental in forming,  in 1961, the Native Friendship Club, the purpose of which was to foster friendship and understanding between Indians and non-Ifndians by freely meeting together in social fellowship. 

 It was here that they encountered the Baha'i Faith. As an outgrowth of this club, the Calgary 

Indian Friendship Centre   

 was established about 1964, and Edmund served as director for a period of time. 

 Although dogged from the beginning of their Baha'i lives by ill health and the need of frequent medical care, the Many Bears and their white Baha friends made many teaching trips


<p358>
358                THE BAHA'I WORLD
     Jean Many Bears            

  throughout the Canadian west, winning friends among people of the Peigan, 

Blood and Cree Indian      

 tribes. They also visited other Indian tribes in the States of Montana and Washington.  Jean had a compelling and quiet manner, and was a very effective teacher. 

 On many occasions she confirmed people in the Faith. Edmund was an especially effective teacher in the Blackfoot tongue and frequently at Baha'i gatherings was asked to intone prayers in that language. He possessed a gentleness, strength and assurance which marked him as a leader. One could feel a spiritual strength emanating from him during periods of prayer. 

 A friend writes of them: "They were very genuine, loving Baha, inflamed with the spirit of the Cause. Due to ill health and the many pressures put upon those who move between two cultures, it was often with great personal sacrifice that they continued their service to the Cause.~~ And again: "They each had a profound understanding of and respect for Baha'u'llah and His Teachings. One felt a certain peace and tranquillity in their company — quite assuredly a combination of their Indian heritage and the influence of their newly-found but well-beloved Faith.. Their teaching efforts and the example of their lives created a bridge of friendship between the Indian and white communities, and their influence assuredly will direct in some measure many whose lives they touched." 

 Succumbing at last to the physical frailties which had plagued them they died but several weeks apart. Even in death they taught — those attending the memorial service held by the Baha'is of Calgary described it as an outstanding  demonstration of love and brotherhood.

    LUCY JANE MARSHALL         

 1879(?) — 1967 The early dates are uncertain. 

 Lucy Jane Marshall, third of the five children of Richard and Ann Brailey Marshall, was born in Nottingham, England, probably in 1879. The family emigrated to the United States in 1882, lived in the Chicago area, went back to England for a while, then returned to America to stay. In the Fall of 1912, the time of the visit of 'Abdu'l-Baha to California, Lucy's story begins to come into focus for us. The family had settled in San Francisco. Lucy at thirty-two was a trim and efficient little stenographer with intense bright eyes. 

 She worked for a shipping firm, Goodall, Nelson and Perkins, which later became the Pacific Steamship Company. Her sister Elizabeth married into the Goodall-Cooper family, and so contacts opened up between the 

Marshalls and Ella Goodall 

 Cooper, one of the most outstanding  and beloved of the early American Baha'is. 

 In October of 1912, when "Aunt Ella" and her mother took the lead in arranging meetings with 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Marshall family came. 

 Elizabeth took longhand notes as best she could. 

 Her little boy, now a kindly San Francisco physician, remembers that the "Great Man" gave him marshmallows. 

 But for Lucy a lasting transformation came about. Whether or not she had any verbal exchange with the Master, she shook His hand, and her life became centered iii the Teachings He exemplified. 

 When formal membership records were kept in San Francisco the names of Lucy and her father and her brother Charles were there.

    Lucy Jane Marshall         
                           
     San Francisco's Baha'i     

 history is illumined with the services of many outstanding teachers and servants of the Faith. 

 Lucy's light is a modest one but absolutely constant, in the records she is never listed as speaker or teacher. Instead she served on the Spiritual Assembly almost continuously until in her eighties, and sometimes she was a member of as many as four local committees and two national ones. 

 Year in and year out she helped to produce the community newsletter with its careful covering of local events and its astonishing enrichment from national and world sources, items gleaned largely from the letters Lucy had received from friends abroad. 

 Her personal correspondencewas prodigious. She had a talent for seeing all pioneers as equally wonderful, and kept in touch with as many as she could, sending little gifts when possible. On the National Contacts Committee where she was chairman for two years she took part in writing about the Faith to people listed in 

Who's Who. Person-to-person

 was Lucy's style in reaching out to others. 

 The other national committee on which she served for many years was first called the Esperanto, then the Universal 

Auxiliary                  

 Language, and finally the World Language Committee. An ardent student of Esperanto herself, she maintained classes in the language season after season in her home, and sometimes  they merged into Baha'i study classes. 

 Hospitality was the other wing of Lucy Marshall's unobtrusive way of service. 

 Her father had built a fine two-flat home at 20 Broderick Street, around th& corner from their ifirst house on Wailer Street. 

 They rented the lower flat, lived in the upper, and had beehives on the roof, withLucy as beekeeper. 

 In the big basement was the workshop, for Richard Marshall Was a skilled cabinetmaker. 

 He kept .a printing press there too, and did a considerable  amount of printing for the Baha'is. 

 Meetings  of mahy sorts were held in the family flat. While other Baha families shared in this kind of service, it was the Marshall home that twice became the regular center for the Nineteen-Day Feasts. 

 Andit was Lucy who became the heart and center of the Marshall home. Her sisters married and moved away. Her mother died in 1932 and her father tenyears later. Her brother Charles, ill for many years as the result of a stroke, stayed with her in the flat until his passiiig in 1953. Still their home was virtually the. 

 Baha'i Center. And whatever the other friends brought for the feast, Lucy made the tea and served it graciously. 

 She had room and welcome for out-of-town visitors, expected or not. Martha Root stayed with her. 

 Another highlight for her was the coming of the first group of Persian students, nine young men, in 1944. They had been given permission by the Guardian to come to America to continue their studies, and they went directly to 20 Broderick Street in San Francisco, telegraphing their parents from there that they had arrived safely. Thee of them forever after spoke of her place as their American home, though they moved away to go to school and later to teach. Lucy treasured their lasting friendship. 

 It seems that her round of duties from typewriter to writing-desk to telephone and cookstove,  and her faithful visits to the sick, never degenerated into drudgery. She had a remarkable  capacity for enjoyment. Her eyes would shine with enthusiasm whether she was with the world famous teacher or the shy new believer. 

 She had a glorious time traveling in Europe with her fellow Esperantist Martha Root when the International 

Esperanto Conference      

 was held in Danzig in 1927. Later that z

 same year she seems to have enjoyed immensely reporting, with Louis Gregory, the 

Nineteenth Annual Baha    

 Convention of the United States and Canada held in Montreal. 

 And when she found she could not attend the 

Convention and Centenary   

 celebration in Wilmette in 1953, she promptly paid the way for a new Baha'i to go in her stead. 

 She made trips to Hawaii and Alaska with Baha'i interests uppermost. 

 And there were motor jaunts with her family to Yosemite and Glacier National Park where, as they came upon bears and other wild creatures, she told her young nephews the Mowgli stories. 

 Tn 1963 she was one of the most enthusiastic of the visitors to the Baha'i World Congress held in London. A photograph of her there1 has caught her sparkling expression of wonder and delight. 

 A year later, when someone at the last minute dropped out of a group leaving for Pine Springs, Arizona, to attend an Indian Council Fire, she was playfully asked if she would like to go. "I was just waiting to be invited!" she said, and in five minutes she was ready. Cheerfully she rode the long distance, slept outdoors in a sleeping bag, and with her courage and good spirits contributed much to that inspiring occasion. 

 In her last days, as her faculties dimmed, she never lost her cheerfulness, nor her childlike faith in Baha'u'llah. Loving friends stayed by her and felt privileged to do so. On January 26, 1967, her eyes closed in their last earthly sleep.

     LOULIE  ALBEE MATHEWS 1869(?) — 1966

  Loulie's contribution to the teaching work of the Faith is inestimable. 

 Her services over a period of many years in various fields of activity demonstrated the great reliance which she placed on prayer and through which she continually sought guidance. 

 She first heard of the Faith from a Mrs. Cocheran. 

 One morning she was shown to a room in Mrs. Cocheran's house. On the table was a single rose and above it hung the protrait of a man of noble bearing in Oriental dress. His eyes penetrated her very soul! 

 It was as though she was drawn by a magnet, a mysterious Baha'i News, June 1963, page 9. 

 attraction, which she could not understand. When She asked the identity of the man in the portrait, Mrs. Cocheran replied: "It is 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Son ofBaM'u'11Th, the Great Prophet Who has recently come to earth in our own times to reveal the Word of God to all mankind. I am sending you on New Year's eve a book. It contains the key to that which you are seek-111g. 
You must begin to study    

His Teachings."            

 The promised book arrived at exactly one minute past twelve (January 1, 1914). It was the Kitdb-i-Iqdn 

(The Book of Certitude)    

 and on the flyleaf Mrs. Cocheran had inscribed 

"To a Baha'i Teacher."    
Loulie pondered: "Could    

 I ever achieve such a mission ?" 

     Sometime later, Loulie     

 and her daughter Wanden (now Mrs. Andrew Kane) were motoring to their country place in the White Mountains and met with an accident when a speeding car ran into them. Loulie was thrown from the vehicle and severely injured. She was carried into the nearest house which proved to be that of her cousin, Harry Randall, and his wife, Ruth, two wellknown early American Baha'is. 

 When Loulie regained consciousness, there on the wall opposite her bed hung the same portrait of 'Abdu'l-Baha Both Harry and Ruth were eager to share their knowledge of the Faith with her. 

 During the weeks before she was able to return to New York, many hours were spent speaking about 'Abdu'l-Baha and His great wisdom and love. His interpretation  of the 

Words of Baha'u'llah       
became a reality to her.   

 Day by day she absorbed more and more and felt the power of this wondrous Cause. 

 When she was able to return to her home, completely recovered, she accepted the Faith wholeheartedly and became active in the New York community. 

 At one of the Nineteen Day Feasts a letter was read from Edith Sanderson of Paris, in which she made a plea that a member of the community come to Paris to help in the teaching  work. Loulie, with the consent of her husband, accepted and sailed shortly afterwards  for France. 

 She settled at the Hotel France et Choiseul, and rented a room on the ground floor for the meetings. At that time there were many Persian believers passing through Paris who always attended the meetings.  One evening Loulie was passing the tea when one of the Persian friends held up his cup; his flowing sleeves fell back and exposed wrists

  that had been severed from the bone. She drew back in horror: "What has happened to you?" His answer came with a sad smile: "I was imprisoned for my Lord, my hands chained above my head." 

 When the friends departed, she questioned her soul about the Faith she had embraced: Did she really know the Station of Baha'u'llah, the Manifestation of God? Could she have borne the chains and prison for His sake? Before she could teach, she concluded, she must first know herself She decided to write to 'Abdu'l-Baha: "Dear 'Abdu'l-Baha, I think I must go home. 

 I don't know enough about the Faith to conduct a class and a Center, and besides I am not good enough.. 

 She laid the stamped envelope on the table planning to post it later. Just at that moment a visitor was announced. He was a tall Persian friend who had come directly from Haifa and the presence of the Master. He handed her a small envelope addressed to her in the handwriting of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Alas! 
she must have it translated.

 She thought of a Persian friend who knew English perfectly and who would translate  it without delay. 

 "The determination to return home is very dear to the heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 The home is the center from which ftfe radiates to all horizons. Do thou go home and be humble andobedient and by-and-by thou shalt become 'Abdu'l-Baha's lion and roar across the 

Seven Seas."               

 These three episodes became the signposts of her future life. From then on she became an instrument to serve the Cause she loved so well. 
     After the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha

(Novem-ber  28, 1921) Loulie

 gave to the Guardian of the Faith the same love and devotion which she had rendered the Master. 

 In 1928 Loulie had the inspiration to establish an International Lending  Library which would have its seat at their villa in Portofino, 

Italy. She wrote to Shoghi Effendi

 to ask if they should include only Baha'i literature. 

 His prompt reply was to "include the Sacred Writings of all religions". Mahy friends entered into the spirit of the idea as a means of spreading the Faith in Europe and the library issued its catalogue and began operating, when suddenly Loulie succumbed to a virulent form of pneumonia. She hovered between life and death for weeks. 

 Her daughter's cabled request for the Guardian's prayers brought a prompt response: "Your mother's work is not finished. She will live to complete it." The faithful doctor who did not believe in miracles saw one now with his own eyes! He did not understand that Shoghi Effendi's prayers had returned her life, but he repeatedly said that nothing in his medical career had prepared him for her recovery. However, he told her she could no longer live near the sea. No New York, no Portofino. 

 She must make her home in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado — "Destiny is a thing apart from knowledge, it is a dimension not in books but descends upon us, in the measure of the Supreme Being's will and no man knoweth." 

    The salubrious Colorado    

 air, the high dry altitude, soon restored Loulie's health. Her vitality restored, her activity increased. 
They moved to Pine Valley. 

 The winds and storms of the future held no tea or. She chose the name "Temerity" for her home, a ranch which was destined to become the school for the pioneers to Latin 

America.                   

 In 1933 Loulie, accompanied byher husband, undertook a teaching journey to the Antipodes and the Pacific. On the ship she interested many souls, one of whom had travelled on the Cedric

362                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 with 'Abdu'l-Baha. She contemplated going to India and, as always, sought the Guardian's advice. 

 He replied:  

     "Dear and Prized CoWorker:1

 feel it would be wiser not to dissipate your energies in so vast a field as India. I would urge you to concentrate on the South American continent for the present, with particular attention to the Hawaiian Islands where the work you have performed is so deeply appreciated. Japan and China are, moreover, fields where, if feasible, you could render notable and timely services. I would also urge you to induce, whenever you find the occasion suitable, some of the friends to settle permanently in South America. Your experience, judgment and devotion fully qualify you in making the proper selection and in encouraging the friends to follow your noble example. 
Lovingly and gratefully,   

Shoghi"                    

  With her husband, known to us all as Matt, Loulie began her work in the 

Latin American field. She  

 visited Panama; Lima, Peru; Valparaiso  and Santiago, Chile; the Chulian lakes; Buenos 

Aires, Argentina; Rio      

 de Janeiro, Brazil; the Philippines. Each place was blessed with a dramatic and inspiring episode which made its mark and assured its future in the Faith. An account of some of Loulie's travels in which she fulfilled the promise of the Master that she would become a lion and "roar across the Seven Seas" has been left us in her book Not Every Sea 

Hath Pearls.               

 As interest grew in Latin America the need for pioneers became urgent and Loulie conceived  the idea of establishing a training center at her Pine Valley home, "Temerity", for all who would volunteer to serve in that capacity. It filled a great need in preparing pioneers to settle in the goal countries. 

 After several years the property was deeded to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States. It was commandeered later by the United States government and purchased for military training  purposes. Thus another chapter was closed. 

 Loulie will long be remembered throughout the Baha'i world. 

 Her brilliance, her never-failing sense of humor which opened the minds and hearts of those who heard her and unfolded  the treasures of the Divine Revelation of Baha'u'llah, made her famous as a Baha'i teacher. 

 Her devotion to the Guardian was a star to her life; his great appreciation of her services and of her spiritual quality is reflected in the following postscript, penned by his own hand, to a letter dated March 13, 1939: "Dear and precious CoWorker: I will assuredly pray from the depth of my heart that your request may be granted... As to your own dear self I am thrilled by the news you give me and by the manner in which you discharge your manifold and vital duties. I am so pleased to know that Mr. Mathews is so closely collaborating  with you. 

 May the Beloved protect and guide you both in the great work you are doing for the Cause. I will place the photo of the Mexican Assembly and the Spanish translation in the Mansion, close to the room where Baha'u'llah passed away. Shoghi"

     MARGERY McCORMICK          

 1889 — 1964 To have been one of the early American Baha who responded to the Tablets of the Divine Plan, devoting thirty-nine years to the promotion  of its goals, must now bring great happiness to the soul of Mrs. Margery McCormick. Born in Winnetka, 

Illinois, on February      

 9, 1889, at a time when lamplighters made their rounds each evening to ignite the gas streetlights, she lived to see not only great technological changes in her country, but also the historic raising up of the Administrative Order of the Baha'i Faith and the beginning of the enlistment of the masses in its ranks. 

 "Grieved passing much loved Margery McCormick devoted servant Faith outstanding teacher board member her indefatigible services successive stages unfoldment divine plan unforgettable.. 

 ." cabled the Hands of the Cause of God residing in the Holy Land on being informed of her passing. 

 Margery received many honors in her lifetime  which she viewed as new opportunities for service. She was appointed as Auxiliary Board member for teaching in 1954, a position which she actively filled until her death in 1964. She was also a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States for a number of years, a member of the 

National


<p363>
IN MEMORIAM                 363

    Margery McC'ormick         

  Teaching Committee of that country, and a distinguished international traveling teacher. 

 Towards the end of her life she represented the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the United States at the establishment of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the South Pacific and of South East Asia and often recalled how thrilling she found those experiences. 

 Optimism was her gift — one lavishly shared with the thousands of visitors to the Baha'i House of Worship in Wilmette during her many years of guiding there, and with countless audiences, especially students on university campuses where she was a popular speaker. 

 At a time of great campus unrest the presence of this serene, assured lady, confidently presenting the vision of a united world and the solutions to contemporary problems contained in the Writings must have left an indelible impression. 

 If you went to Miargery with a problem she would reach for her prayer book and say, "Just the other day I happened to read these words.. 

 .", and then lead you to the Divine key for solving your problem. 

 Certain passages in the Writings became so cherished by her that she gathered them together in a little booklet called Spirit-lifters and in encouraging seekers and Baha'is alike to turn to the Sacred Scripture for help, she would share a copy of this small selection, knowing it would increase thirst for the Word of 

God.                       
     Prior to becoming a Baha'i,

Margery married a Canadian 

 urologist and moved to Edmonton, Alberta. During a return visit to her family in 1925 she met Mr. Albert Vail and became attracted to the Baha Teachings. Following the retirement of her husband the family moved back to the United States. 

 After his death in 1935 she devoted her full attention to the Cause of God and set out for the Holy Land in 1937. 

 Margery's vivid account of her pilgrimage holds a special message for the shy and hesitant: "I wasn't sure then what would happen on pilgrimage; I just knew that I wanted to visit the Shrines and to meet the beloved Guardian. 

 But no one had told me that I would be expected to find my role in the Faith. Each day, at the dinner table, the beloved Guardian would encourage me to prepare a public talk. When I explained to him that I was not able to speak in public and had all my life been shy, he listened carefully and then continued speaking of the talk — I knew I must make an effort." As a child, Margery had not been able to attend school during a lengthy illness, and had developed  a love of reading which stayed with her all her life. 

 Stored in her mind were numerous pertinent facts and observations which now came to assist her. 

 By the end of her pilgrimage, the Guardian had helped her to edit a talk and urged her to commit it to memory. 

 On her return to America, when the boat docked in New York, she was met by the Baha'i friends and asked to speak in the Center. Her life as a platform speaker was launched. 

 Years later, she mentioned that she experienced much anguish and uncertainty on her first pilgrimage and left Haifa a "frightened, raw recruit"; but when she returned on pilgrimage in 1955, she was showered with the warm praise of Shoghi Effendi. "It felt as if all the banners were flying!" she recalled. 

 "It was the happiest time I have ever known." 

 Having committed to memory so many passages from the Writings, Margery's public talks were charged with the spirit and power evoked by offering the Word unchanged, in all its purity. A generation of Baha'is in Canada and the United States came


<p364>
364                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 under her influence; she would meet protestations about lack of capacity with keenly-recalled personal experiences from her first pilgrimage until each listener would feel that there must be something they, too, could do in service to the Cause. 

 Age failed to diminish Margery's service or slow its pace; instead, it added the lustre of continuous, consecrated effort. When an invitation  came to visit some city or college campus  that was new to her, she would study the map and joyfully set out for that area. When her physician warned her to curtail her activities, she told him she would rather "wear out than rust out!" 

 In addition to conducting a prodigious correspondence and devoting a large measure of her time to travel teaching, Margery was a successful business woman with investments in land, houses and dairy farms, and was active in various community organizations in Evanston. She lived toward the end of her life in the Baha'i Home for the Aged in Wilmette of which she was a trustee and sponsor, as well as its first resident. 

 Margery preferred to call it the Baha Home for Senior Citizens, saying that the word ''aged'' applied only to her exterior. 

 Absolute faith was the hallmark of Margery's life. 

 Writing to a friend she said: "No wonder the Word is called 'wine!' Never was anything else so intoxicating when one really has absolute faith in it." Then she quoted: "I belong to him that loveth Me, that holdeth fast to My commandments, and castetli away the things forbidden him in 

My Book."                  

 Her life was constantly guided, her achievements were an answer to prayer. 

 Asked how she knew when "God answers us", she replied: "Because of something we experience. We have a dilation of the breast, a warm feeling of love and devotion for Him. Every word of our prayer becomes vivid and alive. We have a glorious sensation of companionship; we know that God is actually 'closer to us than breathing, nearer than bands and feet' Baha'u'llah becomes our Best Beloved, our Comforter, our Refuge, our Strength, the Forgiver of our sins, our 

Savior and Redeemer.       

 It is all too glorious to describe what it is that awaits each soul who learns to pray until God answers him." 

 At her passing on July 14, 1964, in her seventy-fifth year, the Universal House of Justice cabled:

    ALLEN B. McDANIEL          

 1879 — 1965 Mien B. McDaniel was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, September 5, 1879. His father was a wellknown Unitarian minister, and from childhood he was reared in an atmosphere of liberal religious thought. 

 As though in preparation for the services he was to render in the construction of the Mother Temple of the West, Mr. McDaniel chose to become a Civil Engineer, and in 1901 received a degree in Architectural Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the foremost university of its kind in the United States. 

 It was more than a decade after his graduation that Allen McDaniel found the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 This occurred shortly after the passing of his wife, at about the time of the outbreak  of World War I, when he was serving on the faculty of the 

University of Illinois     

 and came in contact with the growing Baha'i community in Urbana, the seat of this institution  of higher learning. 

 In his book The Spell of the Temple Mr. McDaniel describes his experiences and reactions  in learning of the Faith and reading for the first time The 

Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah.

 Allen McDaniel became a Baha'i in 1915, but it was not until about five years later that he began his association with the work of the first 

Baha'i House of Worship    

 in the Western world, when he was invited to advise the Temple Trustees on the elevation of the main floor of the Temple structure. 

 In the years which followed, Mr. McDaniel became increasingly absorbed in the challenging task of translating into a permanent and beautiful building the dream of Louis Bourgeois,  the Baha'i architect who designed the "Temple of Light". Finally, in 1930, the Temple Trustees requested Allen McDaniel and his


<p365>
IN MEMORIAM                 365

    Allen B. McDaniel          

  firm to undertake the supervision of the erection of the superstructure of the Temple, which was begun in the Fall of that year. 

 Throughout the remaining difficult stages of completing this unique and spiritually significant  building, the cornerstone of which was laid by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, Mr. McDaniel devoted a major part of his professional activity to this highly important work, to which he brought the dedication and enthusiasm of a devoted believer in combination with his outstanding technical knowledge and experience. 

 Mr. McDaniel attended as a delegate the annual Baha'i Convention of 1925, held in Green Acre, the site of one of the Baha'i Summer Schools, and it was at this convention that he was for the first time elected as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 

States and Canada. Following

 this first call to service on the highest administrative body of the Faith in North America, he continued as one of its members for twenty-one consecutive years (1925 — 1946), a period coinciding  with the intensive development of the Administrative Order in the West, under the unerring guidance of the Guardian of the Faith. 

 During most of these years, in addition to his unique contribution to the technical aspects of completing the superstructure and exterior ornamentation of the Temple in Wilmette, Mr. McDaniel served as Chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly, and rendered many other significant services to the Faith, including contacts  with officials of the government of the United States and official representatives of many other governments in connection with matters affecting the Faith. 

 In the final stage of the completion of the Temple, the execution of the interior ornamentation of this unique structure (1947 — 1952), Mr. McDaniel served as a member of the Technical Advisory Board appointed by the Temple Trustees, thus extending to a period of more than thirty years his direct and active association with the construction of the Mother Temple of the West. 

 In addition to the technical knowledge and experience which enabled Allen McDaniel to make such an invaluable contribution to the building of the Temple he had a vision of its true significance and purpose, based on his deep study of the 

Teachings of Baha'u'llah   

 and 'Abdu'l-Baha This is reflected in the following quotations from his book describing The Spell of the Temple: "In the years to come, around this Universal House of Worship will cluster institutions of social service and public welfare. 

 for under the New World Order, the salvation of a world in travail can come only from spiritual communion  with God and the intelligent application of His laws to the daily life of humanity." 

 The following message, sent by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States after Mr. McDaniel's passing, serves as a befitting epilogue to this memorial tribute to a distinguished  and much beloved servant of the

      NI'MAT YIGANIGI
      RAM DAYAL SHARMA

  A motor accident on February 26, 1963, took the lives of Bahman Mihrab&ni, Ni'mat YigThigi and Ram Dayal Sharma and deprived 

                                   Ni'mat Yigdnigi

  Balimnan Mihrabd iii the Baha'i community of India of three of its most outstanding teachers. 

 They had played an active role in initiating teaching in the remote villages and mass enrollment areas of the country. They were travelling to New Delhi to attend a recently called conference to celebrate the teaching victories achieved and to plan a campaign of expansion and consolidation.  The friends gathered at the conference held a memorial meeting to mourn the loss of their three companions whose dedicated service was a source of inspiration and an example deserving of emulation. 

 Bahman MibrabAni, in his early teens, left his home in Yazd, Persia, and settled in Bombay. He learned of the Cause through his uncle and quickly embraced it. He was a gifted teacher and won to the Cause many people of capacity. With his wife and family he pioneered to Gwalior where there were no resident Baha'is 

Rain Dayal Sharma


<p367>
IN MEMORIAM                367

 and largely through his devoted efforts the area became an active centre of mass conversion. He is remembered as a gentle, humble and kind man whose actions were a source of attraction to those who met him. 

 Ni'mat YigAnigi was born in Poona, India, and was only twenty-three years of age at the time of his passing. He was a student of agriculture at the University of Poona and achieved recognition both as a scholar and as an athlete and sportsman. 

 He was born into a family of Baha'i pioneers who had assisted in building Spiritual Assemblies in various parts of India. Although just a few months remained before the completion of his studies, he was eager to participate in mass teaching before the end of the Ten Year Crusade and had volunteered to serve in Madhya Pradesh as a temporary settler. 

 His loving spirit, lucid explanations and moving recitation of prayers won the hearts of the villagers he taught. 

 In the last few months of his short life he assisted in carrying the Message to the remotest corners of Madhya Pradesh, forgetting rest and comfort in an outpouring  of sacrificial service. 

 Ram Dayal Sharma was born into a Hindu family of high caste. Although he was a Brabmin by birth, he was devoid of caste prejudice.  Before accepting the Faith he was elected 

President of Village       

 Panchayat, a position which accorded him judicial powers to settle village disputes. He was deeply loved by the villagers for his strong sense of justice and his untiring services on behalf of rich and poor alike. 

 Upon accepting the Faith of IBahA'u'IIdh, he became an enthusiastic teacher noted for his capacity to present, in simple and moving language, the glad tidings of the return of Krishna. He was a gifted organizer and a fine singer and in the short span of his Baha'u'llah brought the Faith to thousands of people representative of all castes and walks of life. His sincerity and love of service endear his memory to those who knew him.

  Herma Weidle was born in 1902 in Stuttgart, Germany. 

 Her father was a policeman and the family lived in modest circumstances. 

 llama was a sunny, radiant girl with a fun-loving and vivacious nature, and was loved by everyone. 

 Tn 1920, five years before her husband became acquainted with her, the Master had prophesied in a Tablet addressed to Adelbert Mtihlschlegel: 'Whine honoured wife will be favoured at the 

Threshold of Oneness       

 and looked upon with eyes of mercy." When she became a Baha'i and married Dr. Mtihlschlegel she personified to everyone the ideal of a loving, deeply sympathetic heart completely without prejudices. 

 Hence her home became a wellknown  centre of hospitality and friendship, and it was blessed with five joyful children. 

 In 1936 Herma made a pilgrimage with her husband to the 

Baha World Centre. The    

 meeting with the Guardian confirmed, heightened and inflamed her devotion to the Faith. 

 When the suppression of the Faith in Ger


<p368>
368                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 many before World War II caused the interruption of Baha'i activities and the severing of connections with the world at large, Herma devised a means of maintaining communication with the Holy Land. Possessed of a beautiful  voice, Herma after some difficulty finally succeeded in obtaining permission from the State to take special singing lessons with a noted teacher and composer in ZUrich, Switzerland. This made it possible for her to dispatch reports to the beloved Guardian and to bring his messages into Germany. Herma's courage, strengthened by her deep love for Baha'u'llah, made possible the bringing of much needed guidance from the World Centre to the German Baha'is in their difficulties before the beginning of the Second World War. 

 In the postwar years of rebuilding the German national Baha'i community, again Herma arose to serve the Cause of God in a variety of ways. She was a reliable administrator as well as a loving teacher. 

 Her Baha'i life was an example of devotion and service. 

When a young Persian Baha 

 student lost part of her skin through an accident, Herma spontaneously  offered a portion of her own skin tissue. The transplantation succeeded very well. 

 Later, therhythm of Herma'slife was calmer, her husband frequently travelling for the Cause and her children having established homes of their own. But her last illness had already begun. In 1964, after intense suffering, she radiantly ascended to the eternal homeland, on the blessings of which she had so often reflected on earth.

       FRED MURRAY                

 1884 — 1963 Beneath a shady tree somewhere along the coast of Esperance Bay in West Australia, about the year 1884, an Australian aboriginal woman of the Minen tribe gave birth to a son. A pure soul was born, lived and grew to become  probably the most wellknown person of his race. 

 His parents died when he was quite young. He and his brother were fostered by a European woman, the wife of a sheep station manager, who lived in the area. This proved the means of 

       Fred Murray                

  saving their lives as during an extremely serious drought soon after they were orphaned, the entire tribe died from drinking poisoned water. The two boys later travelled by foot many hundreds of miles overland to Yalata Sheep Station in South Australia, living off the land as was their tribal custom. 

 Yalata Station was owned by a family by the name of Murray who loved and cared for the boys. It was during this period that the young men adopted the name Murray. And so Fred Murray became a named citizen of Australia. Fred worked herding sheep and cattle, riding horses, prospecting, and living the rough life that prevailed at that time. His brother was killed while taming wild horses and thus Fred became the last living member of his tribe. Much of his life was spent with a family named Crowder and it was through this association that he was eventually brought to the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 Fred married one of his own race, an aboriginal woman from Lake Victoria. 

 He lived and worked along the River Murray for the rest of his life. 

 He travelled the river on the paddle steamers and workedinthe driedfruitsindustry. On reaching the age of retirement, Fred went


<p369>
IN MEMORIAM                369

 with his wife, son and two daughters to live on Gerard Aboriginal Reserve in the Upper Murray  River area of South Australia. 

 His wife died a short time afterwards. 

 Baha'is from Renmark visited the reserve and so Fred Murray met the Harwood family who were descendants of the Crowder family he had known and loved so long. Learning of the Baha'i Faith he was deeply impressed by its Teachings. 

 "One people, one God, everybody one — that is good!" 

 he often said. Ills decision to become a Baha'i was made on June 23, 1961. lie became an active teacher and served on the Spiritual 

Assembly of Renmark.      

 Fred was deeply loved by the Hand of the Cause 

Collis Featherstone.      
At the dedication of the  

Mother Temple of Australasia
he met the Hand of the    

Cause of God Amatu'I-BahA Rii~iyyih

 KMnum — "the dear Lady who sends out the love from Haifa," he called her. 

 There he also met Jessie Revell and Baha'i friends from all over the world, including the Hand of the Cause 

Dr. Ralxmatu'llAh Mirza  

 whom he accompanied on a teaching trip to South Australia and Victoria. 

 Perhaps the greatest thrill of Fred's life was attending the Most Great Jubilee celebration in London in 1963. There in Albert Hall, surrounded  by thousands of Baha from around the globe, he spoke of the sorrow and suffering of his much persecuted people and added: "When I was a baby, my people died. I thought, 'I have no people!' But now lam Baha'i — you are all my people." Fred was loved by everyone and his conduct and charm were so natural that he could enter any company and be perfectly at ease. 

 His Baha'i friends and others spontaneously called him "Uncle", a term of respect and affection. 

 Fred had never been to school hut had a wisdom and dignity of impressive dimensions. 

 Fred's advanced age and failing sight made it impossible for him to travel unaccompanied. Consequently he went to live in the city, transferring  to the Burnside community. 

 But God had other plans for him and Fred Murray, the first full-blooded Australian aboriginal to become a Baha'i, passed on to the Abh~ Kingdom on December 21, 1963, in his seventy-ninth year. 

 There is a bronze bust of Fred in the American National Museum and also in the South Australian Art Gallery. These were made when Fred was about thirtyfive years of age as he was considered to be a "perfect specimen" of his race. 

 As time goes by, the world will learn how perfect.

      HENDRIK OLSEN             

  On June 20, 1967, the first indigenous Baha'i of Greenland passed away. 

 Although he was an elderly man when he became a believer in the summer of 1965, he rendered distinguished service to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 He began serving the Cause many years before he became formally affiliated with it, and the effect of his spirit, as well as his physical contribution to the work of the Cause in Greenland, will be felt for many years after his passing to the AbhA Kingdom. 

 Mr. Olsen's contact with the Faith began some twenty years before his declaration of belief, when Johanne 

S0rensen (later Mrs. Johanne

 H0eg), the first Danish Baha'i, sent


<p370>
370                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 letters and literature about the Faith to several places in Greenland. One of these many letters reached Mr. Olsen who replied courteously with words of appreciation. The ensuing correspondence led him to translate into the Greenlandic language the booklet Baha'u'llah og 

Hans Budskab (Baha'u'llah 
and His Message).         

 This was a remarkable contribution. The Greenlandic language had oniy recently been committed to written form, and although still evolving, its development since then has been very rapid. 

 Mr. Olsen brought to bear on his task his own considerable skill as a writer and translator. 

 Highly respected and trusted by his compatriots, Mr. Olsen more than once had served as an elected member of the local government, and had been selected by the wellknown  Danish-Greenlandic writer and explorer, Mr. Knud Rasmussen, to translate his books. He approached the Baha'i translation with characteristic care and reverence, and seeking a measure of security for its accuracy sought the assistance of the kateket, the local Protestant priest, in reviewing his work. 

 Mr. Olsen's correspondence with Mrs. Johanne H0eg was maintained for many years. In the spring of 1965 he wrote expressing the desire to meet, once in his life, a believer in the Cause of Baha'u'llah, the principles and Teachings of which increasingly attracted him. Mrs. H0eg, then some seventy years of age, undertook the long and arduous journey to Greenland, an island highly exposed to inclement weather, and offering little accommodation. 

 It was a great relief to the Danish Baha'i community when young Dr. H. Ra'fat volun-teeredto  accompany Mrs. H0eg. They travelled by ship and by plane, taking the long route. 

 The meeting in the summer of 1965 in Upernavik at ilendrik Olsen's home was both cordial and poignant for the longtime correspondents. 

 Mr. Olsen signed a declaration of his acceptance of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, expressing regret for not having done so much earlier. 

 Eager to translate his belief into action, he offered to translate into Greenlandic Baha'u'llah and the New Era, a work he had oniy half accomplished when he passed away and which the Baha group in Godthaab is making efforts to complete. 

 Hendrik Olsen was unquestionably a leader in Greenland, and in many ways a pioneer — a 

      Hendrik Olsen             

  feature apparently running in his family, as he was a direct descendant of the first Greenlandic Christian — and his prestige on this vast island is still very great. His name will long be remembered  in the Baha community. 

 The humility and courteousness radiating from his letters, which Johanne Hseg has cherished and preserved,  will be a source of inspiration for coming generations. 

 Informed of his passing, the Universal House of Justice cabled:

   FLORENCE F. PINCHON       

  Although she was one of the earliest luminaries of the Baha'i Faith in the British Isles and one of its most able exponents, whose example, lectures and writings had a profound influence on those who subsequently embraced the Cause, and although the recipient of a glowing tribute from Shoghi Effendi, little is known about the personal life of Florence Pinchon,


<p371>
IN MEMORIAM                 371

 even by those who deeply admired her and benefited from her tutelage. To one of her retiring and unostentatious nature the appreciations  received upon her passing would have been a source of embarrassment. She was disciplined,  patrician, impeccable in manner and dress, and for half a century served the Baha Cause with serene conviction of its ultimate triumph. 

 The first written account of Miss Pinchon's association with the Baha'i Faith is to be found in the letters of Dr. 3. E. 

Essleniont to Dr. Lutfu'11Th

 Uakim, written between 1915 — 1921. Dr. Esslemont was at that time resident medical officer at the Home Sanatorium, IBournemouth. Hewroteon May 6,1915: "This afternoon Miss Pinchon, Miss Duke, Miss Martyn and I had a little meeting; they are all deeply interested. 

 " And then, on May 19: "Miss Pinchon and one or two others are coming tomorrow. Quite a number of friends here are interested in reading the books and I am getting quite a little lending library now." 

 "The interest continues to grow quietly," he wrote the following month. 

 "I hope you will be able to pay a return visit to Bournemouth during the summer to help us along. I have Baha'i talks here every Wednesday and Thursday with a few friends and am keeping a good deal of literature circulating, and am preparing the ground and sowing seed as I find opportunity." 

  In April 1916 Dr. Esslemont

 related that "our meetings are not very large but they are helpful" and three months later that Miss Pinchon was teaching a Baha'i class for children; the class donated ten shillings to the Temple Fund and occasionally held their meetings at the home of Major Tudor 

Pole.                      

 Dr. Esslemont records on August 2,1919, that "Miss 

Pinchon's Progressive      

 Thought Library seems to be getting on well. 

 Lam going to give a lecture on Esperanto there.., 

 and she hopes, after that lecture, to start Esperanto Classes at the library." 

 A letter to Dr. Ijakim dated March 21, 1920 states that Miss Pinchon was "delighted" to receive a message from 'Abdu'l-Baha  which had been forwarded through Dr. Esslemont. "I saw 

Miss Pinchon today," Esslemont

 wrote. "We were talking about starting a weekly Baha'i meeting at her library. 

 I have started revising and pruning the book. 

 ." The following summer Dr. Esslemont wrote of the visit of a Baha'i teacher from London, Mrs. George, who came to assist the struggling Bournemouth group. In the spring of 1921 he was able to report that he and Miss Pinchon had shared with some others the platform of a Baha'i public meeting held at Boscombe which nine attended, and that Feasts were held regularly at Miss Pinchon's library. 
    After the passing of the   

Master in 1921, Miss Pinchon's
love for 'Abdu'l-Baha.     

 flowered into fruitful service. The interplay of the Baha'i teachings upon her creative mind resulted in the publication of a book The Coming of the Glory. Written just six years after the Baha world was deprived of the physical presence of the Centre of the Covenant, the book reflects a deep grasp of the history of the Cause and its spiritual and administrative teachings which are imaginatively presented. "Your book admirable in presentation exquisite in style," Shoghi Effendi cabled Miss Pinchon in 

1927. Volume II of The     
Baha'i World places The Coming

 of the Glory at the head of the twenty-one  titles listed as "Baha'i Publications of England" and notes that the book "has been highly endorsed by Shoghi Effendi". 

 In her preface to the slim volume Miss Pinchon states: "The following has been written in the hope that it may serve to awaken interest, particularly among the young and thoughtful, in a great modern Movement, the spirit and principles of which are, I believe, the spiritual light of the epoch now opening before us, and which is steadily gaining adherents, and the recognition of enlightened and progressive minds, in every quarter of the globe." 

 The book was serialized in Star of the West, commencing with Volume xviii, in 1927. The footnote introducing it contained another appreciation  from the Guardian: "The book is correct in its presentation of the essentials of the Faith, eminently readable, exquisitely arranged, and has a distinctive charm unsurpassed by any book of its kind, whether written by Eastern or Western believers. 

 I heartily recommend it to every earnest and devout teacher of the 

Cause."                    
    Between 1927 — 1936 Miss     

 Pinchon contributed  generously to Baha periodicals. 

 In addition  to the instalments of her book, the pages of early issues of Star of the West and World Order magazine carried fifteen articles on an astonishingly  wide variety of subjects, one play dramatizing  an encounter between a devout Christian


<p372>
372                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 clergyman and a travelling Baha'i teacher from the East, and a series of four presentations of the Cause to those speaking from the position of sincere belief in the Church of England, Theosophy, 

Spiritualism and Christian 
Science.                   

 In a letter to the Baha'i friends in Great Britain written on December 16, 1922, the Guardian stated: "That in every one of you our departed Master reposed his future and truest hopes for an able and convincing presentation of the Cause to the outside world is abundantly revealed in His spoken and written words to you, as well as in His general references to the spirit of sincerity, of tenacity and devotion that animates His friends in that land.., the rise... of a few but indeed capable, reliable, devoted and experienced followers and admirers of the Cause; the splendid and in many instances unique opportunities that are yours — these indeed are cherished thoughts for a land that illumines its past and should cheer its future," In the same message he wrote of the "comfort-ing  and sustaining" thought that his British, coworkers had offered "spontaneous and undiminished  support, as well as wise and experienced assistance" which he assured them would "hearten me in the midst of my future labours for the Cause". Inspired by words like these, Miss Pinchon took up her gifted pen. 

 Of the many articles she wrote perhaps none was more treasured than her compilation of the Baha'i teachings on the immortality of the soul, published as a pamphlet in Great Britain in 1945 and reprinted in the United States in 1954. One cannot estimate into how many homes this splendid booklet entitled Life After Death brought solace and comfort. For many years, nothing in Baha'i literature was so appropriate a gift to friends who had suffered the loss of loved ones. 

 One who loved Miss Pinchon has written: "I spent a year in Bournemouth, 1946 — 1947... As a young Baha'i I used to love to visit 'Floy' Pinchon in her modest bedsitter and listen to her talking. 

 She was very scholarly, had deep spiritual perception, and I grew very fond of this rare person. But she was the master and I was a grateful pupil. 

 I like to think I was able to give Floy a little pleasure; our last meeting we celebrated by rowing up the river from Christchurch and had tea and scones — it was an ideal summer day. 

 She did so enjoy simple things and really appreciated any small treat. I often found in her a youthful enthusiasm, an almost childish delight, that, blended with her brilliant mind, made her such a delightful companion. Being shy and retiring she did not mix readily and sometimes one sensed that her world was far removed from this one for which she probably cared little. I am one who is glad to have enjoyed her companionship and who often recalls the refuge to which I fled in my youth, to seek the world of Ploy Pinchon and rest awhile.' 

 Another correspondent attests: "My recollections of Florence Pinehon go back to her visit to Bradford in 1939 when, as a year-old Baha, I sat at her feet and absorbed a great deal from her. In later years I occasionally went on teaching trips to Bournemouth and spent precious hours with her. In spite of her quiet nature she kept herself amazingly well-informed about world events and had a tremendous  vision of the future of the Cause. At a time when some of the friends were struggling to achieve an awareness of the station of the beloved Guardian, Eloy had already achieved that insight and given him her heart, loyalty and obedience. 

 I found her quietly hesitant when speaking privately, but she could give a firm, impressive, knowledgeable and well-planned public address. On the subject of immortality, she had no rival." 

 A third friend writes: "At an early summer school 

I heard Miss Pinchon       

 give one of the most spiritually-uplifting and comprehensive talks that I have ever heard. 

 Her intellectual capacity was amazing. Her wide reading, her intellectual gifts and her grasp of the Baha'i teachings were of the utmost value and importance  to the Bournemouth community." 

 Miss Pinchon's death on March 31, 1966, was recorded with deep sorrow by the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the British Isles: ..... frail in body but indomitable in spirit, dear Miss Pinchon waited serenely to pass through the door of the Abh~i Kingdom. Only a few days before her death we received a letter from her in which she welcomed the Messenger of Joy." 

     Perhaps Florence Pinchon's 

 own epitaph would be found in the words attributed to one of the characters in her book, The Coming of the Glory: "It is not so much a new life, as life renewed..."

      AMPELIUS POSY              

  Mr. Ampelius Posy was born in Jacmel, Haiti, the son of a Baptist minister. 

 He completed his studies in that city. In later years his business took him to the city of St. Marc where, in 1955, 

      Ampelius Posy              

  he first encountered the Baha'i Faith. He was a member of the first Spiritual Assembly of that community and much of the Baha'i activity there centered in and around his home. In 1961 he served as a member of the first historic National Spiritual 

Assembly of Haiti.         

 In 1963 when enrollment in significant numbers began in Haiti Mr. Posy emerged as a flame of fire and perhaps in this period made his most outstanding contribution to the work of the Cause. It was through his spirit, energy and enthusiasm that the first large community of Baha'is came into being in Haiti, the corn-munity  of Pont ]3enoit in the Artibonite 

Valley. The Mount Carmel   

 Baha'i School flourishes in this active community today. Classes are conducted by the Baha'is of Pont Beno it. Entry by troops into the Faith of Baha'u'llah followed swiftly in other areas in the wake of the development  of Pont Benoit and many large communities  were established through the efforts of the friends in the Artibonite Valley. A number of fine 

BahA'ipioneers of Haitian  

 nationality have also come from this region. 

 Mr. Posy passed away very suddenly on October 17, 1965, following a short illness. He was the first to have a strictly Baha'i burial in the Republic of Haiti. He is interred in the cemetery of St. 

Marc.

 MUUAMMAD UUSAYN RAWHANI    

 1899 — 1965  

Mubammad Ijusayn Rawh~ni   

 was born into a Muslim family in K~izir6n, Ir&n. In 1926 he learned of the Baha'i Faith though his eldest brother and after thorough investigation accepted  it. Although formerly illiterate he commenced  an assiduous study of the Teachings. His concentrated studies and constant association with knowledgeable Baha'is soon qualified him as an effective teacher. 
He taught actively in      

Khurramshahr and Many6hf.  

 For a number of years he served on the Spiritual Assemblies of Abdd&n and Khurramshahr and was a delegate to the National 

Convention.                

 His business affairs suffered because he was known as a Baha'i but soon his neighbours and associates learned that he was righteous and fair in his dealings and were drawn to him. 

 One dayhe was informed that his neighbours were stoninghis house and abusing his pregnant wife. 

 He rushed home to find that his wife had fainted and was bleeding profusely. 

 The attending  doctor urged him to complain to the authorities but instead he forgave the offenders. This incident increased his fame among his associates and those who were hostile toward him, and as he gained acceptance and recognition  his financial affairs prospered. 

 The Rawh~ni home became a centre of hospitality for pioneers en route to 'IrAq. One pioneer family wrote to Shoghi Effendi expressing  their gratitude for this assistance and in reply received a letter written on behalf of the beloved Guardian praising the actions of Mr. and Mrs. Rawhdni in extending care and hospitality to the pioneers. 

 In 1949 Mr. RawhAni served for eight difficult  months in Mecca, assisting the friends there in the establishment of the Spiritual Assembly.


<p374>

Mukammad Husayn Rawbdni

  The airplane on which he was returning to Persia crashed. He rendered assistance to the injured passengers among whom was an eminent  Egyptian who was a great enemy of the Faith. The enemy was moved by the kindness and affection Mr. RawliAni demonstrated toward the injured passengers. 

He invited Mr. RawliAni

 to visit Cairo as his personal guest, an incident which pleased the believers in Cairo. 

 The greatest task of Mr. RawhAni's life, one which assures his enduring fame, was the identification of the grave of the father of Baha'u'llah, Mirza Buzurg, in Karbil&. 

 This mission was entrusted to him by the National Spiritual 

Assembly of Persia     

 and he persevered in this difficult assignment for three years, at the end of which time he identified the grave and photographed the tombstone for the approval of Shoghi Effendi. Having received assurance from the Guardian that it was correct he succeeded, with the aid of another Baha'i friend, in transferring the remains to the Baha cemetery in Bag~d~d. 

 During an outbreak of persecution in 1955 the Baha'is of Persia were in great danger. Mr. RawliAni's home in Khurramshahr was stoned several times but owing to the respect in which he was held by the local Chief of Police he was spared further ordeals. 

 Mr. Rawh6ni became ill in 1964 and sought 

THE BAHA'I WORLD       

  treatment in London where he passed away a year later. According to his wish he is buried in the Great 

Northern Cemetery      

 in London, near the resting place of the Guardian of the Faith. A modest man who never spoke of the many contributions he made to the work of the Cause, Mr. RawhAni became widely known within and without the Faith for his devotion, kindness and exemplary behaviour. 
                       
 SIYYID 'ALL RID VANI   

 1894 — 1964  

Siyyid 'All Ri4v~ni    

 was born into a conservative Muslim family and became a devoted Shay~hi. 

 He learned of the Baha Faith at an early age and quickly embraced it, devoting the rest of his life to its service. He made many teaching trips throughout eastern bin from Mashhad to Bandar 'Abbas, and found great happiness in visiting the House of the Mb in Shir&z. Although ostracized and deprived of his inheritance by his family when he became a Baha'i, Mr. Ri~IvAnf continued to serve the Cause wholeheartedly, and ultimately experienced the joy of welcoming his brother into the Faith. 

 A frequent victim of persecution because of his allegiance to the Baha'i Cause, Mr. RhJvAni on one occasion received a threatening communication from a religious group calling itself the Islamic Society which said: "Come, Oh you who have lost your way, your religion and your Faith, come and be Muslim. Come and drive away that satanic belief, repent to the Muslim mu11~... 

 If you fail to do so, be assured that we will kill you during the days of RamaQ~n.. Your death will be accomplished easily.. it will cost us just one bullet to correct your negation of truth. Come, have pity on your soul, and purify it from evil beliefs. If not, you will not escape certain and immediate death even if you remain in your home." 

 As a result of a conspiracy led by a hostile mu11~, Mr. RhJv~ini was attacked and received twenty-thee knife wounds. His body was cast into an abandoned well some distance from the village of RAvar, iAn, and he was considered dead. 

 A Baha friend who witnessed the assault informed the Baha'is who came thirty-six hours later, under cover of darkness, to transport the


<p375>

    Siyyid 'Au R4lvdnf         

  body for burial. It was discovered that Mr. RiijvAni was still alive. His recovery was effected after a lengthy recuperation in Kirm&n. Eager to participate in the Ten Year Crusade, Mr. Ri4vAni with his wife and some members of his family pioneered to Morocco in December  1954 where their home became a centre of attraction and confirmation. 

 The devoted couple assisted in the establishment of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Rabat in 1955. Later they served on the Spiritual Assemblies of Tetuan and Kenitra and, in 1958, assisted in the formation of the first 

Spiritual Assembly of Sal& 

 In 1930, and again in 1953, Mr. and Mrs. RkLv~nf made pilgrimages to the Holy Land. A treasured experience drawn from that first pilgrimage was that the beloved 

Guardian permitted Mr.     

 Ri~1v&ni to serve as the host to the pilgrims attending the Feast held in the garden of RhJvAn on the ninth day of the Ri4vAn period. Mr. RiQv~ini kept alive his memory of that occasion by requesting the Baha'is, wherever he was, to permit him to be their host on the ninth day of RhjvAn, a small personal tradition warmly remembered by his friends. 

 Mr. Rhlvdni was one of the happy, excited Baha'is who gathered in London in 1963 to celebrate the Most Great Jubilee and the successful  conclusion of the Ten Year Crusade in which he had played a significant role in Morocco. 

 After a brief illness he passed away on June 28, 1964, and is buried in the Baha'i cemetery of Rabat. He williong be remembered as an example of the courage and steadfastness to which Baha'u'llah calls those who arise to serve 

His Cause:                 

  And be thou so steadfast in My love that thy heart shall not waver, even if the swords of the enemies rain blows upon thee and all the heavens and the earth arise against thee...

  This was the cabled reply by Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, to the message from the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the Baha of the United States informing him of the death of Mrs. Annie Romer in Manchester, Connecticut, on March 6, 1955, after long months of intense suffering. 

 A review of the many letters Mrs. Romer received from the Guardian, several of which address her as "dearly loved and precious Baha'i sister", reveals that most of her early work for the Faith was done under his persona! direction. 

 Daughter of John 13. and Isabel Seymour Brown, Annie Romer was born in South Windsor, Connecticut, onJanuary24, 1876. Her husband, Harry H. Romer, was a newspaper correspondent and held important posts during World War I with the Associated Press in Berlin and London after which he became a member of the staff of that organization in London where he was stationed at the time of the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. lit was largely through Mr. Romer's efforts that the news of 

AA


<p376>
376                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 this heartrending event was heralded to the Baha throughout the world. 

 Following their marriage in the United States, Mr. and Mrs. Romer moved to London and for several years Annie was very active in the London Baha community, serving for some time as secretary of the Local 

Spiritual Assembly. The    

 letters exchanged between Shoghi Effendi and herself, especially between 1930 and 1934, record that under his instructions  she secured from a number of persons of international renown statements of appreciation of the Baha'i Faith, some of which were later published in Volume VIII of The Baha'i World and other Baha'i documents. Among those she interviewed for this purpose were Sir Francis Younghusband, Arnold J. Toynbee, Dr. Han Prasad 

Shastri, Lillian Helen     

 Montague,  and the Reverend Griffith J. Sparham. Also, at the Guardian's instructions, Mrs. Romer gave the message of the Baha Faith to many other men and women of great influence and renown in the fields of science, literature and religion. 

 Through her efforts persons prominent in public affairs were often invited to the Baha'i Center in London and to speak at public meetings sponsored by the London Spiritual Assembly. Annie also arranged for a number of these individuals to meet Baha'is of prominence in other countries where they might be visiting. 

 Furthermore, she maintained close contact with various organizations working for peace and often made arrangements to include Baha'i speakers on their platforms. 

 Ofttimes the speaker was Lady Blomfield and sometimes herself. 

 When Harry Romer passed away suddenly on April 13, 1935, Annie was plunged into deep grief and returned to the United States broken in health, almost without funds and without a home. 

 About a year later she wrote to the Guardian from New York asking for guidance. "I am trying to sense alittle of what Baha'u'llah means," she stated, "when lie reiterates... that we are to go forth and teach His Cause if necessary alone. I have a little money and could use it and go somewhere to teach, or keep it for my old age.., 

 and then I may not live to be very old... I pray I may be a channel in some way for His glorious Message." The Guardian expressed his admiration for her "fortitude, unsparing devotion and unshakable resolve" and urged her "not to allow sorrow and bereavement reavement to interfere with the progress of your historic services and activities". 

 He advised her to "fully concentrate" on the matter of teaching and suggested that if possible she go back to England to aid in the new teaching campaign, or to Central or South America where "the future is full of promise". 

 Mrs. Romer returned to London a few months later but, unable to find employment and with her funds fast dwindling, she returned to New York at the end of October, 1937. Here she began to study Baha'i Administration and to bring herself up to date on teaching methods. She attended classes at Green Acre and met Martha Root, Keith Ransom-Keller and other pioneer teachers whose reports, as she wrote to Shoghi Effendi in April, 1938, "have stimulated me and given me new hope and helped clear away many questions and problems. May Baha'u'llah assist me to translate this into action and to spread the knowledge where it will do most good." 

 Again expressing his great gratitude for her historic services in England, the Guardian replied that for the present America "provides the best and most promising field on which to concentrate". 

 That was early in the first Seven Year Plan. From then on through the remainder of her life, Annie Romer was available for any and all teaching assignments, no matter how difficult. Her knowledge of the Teachings, her love and devotion to the Faith, her humility and self-sacrifice  were a great inspiration to Baha'is and non-Bah&is wherever she went. One of her most significant services during this period was her settlement in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, where she helped to bring into being the first Local Spiritual Assembly in that province in 1944. 

 In 1946 Mrs. Romer responded to the call to settle in the southern states to strengthen the new communities that had been formed during the first Seven Year Plan. 

Making Greenville, South   

 Carolina, her headquarters for the next three years, she devoted all her time to teaching in the surrounding states. Next she moved to Columbia, South Carolina, for some months and later spent approximately a year in New Orleans, Louisiana, after which she settled in Louisville, Kentucky, from 1951 to 1953. Then after residing a few months in Knoxville, Tennessee, her health began to fail rapidly but


<p377>
IN MEMORIAM                 377

 she never ceased to continue her teaching, even when recuperating from surgery for cancer. Finally, when all hope for recovery was aban-dqncd,  Annie was taken to the home of her brother, J. S. Brown, in Manchester, Connecticut,  where she passed away, leaving, besides two brothers, a sister, a stepson, several grandchildren, nieces and nephews. 

 "0 thou lady of the Kingdom," she was called by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the one precious letter she had received from the Master. Her manyloving letters of appreciation from the Guardian and her glowing record of service testify how brilliantly Annie Romer lived up to this title. 

CHARLOTTE LINFOOT          
                           
   ALICE SCHWARZ-SOLIVO       

 1875 — 1965 Alice Schwarz, the daughter of the Bavarian industrialist, Heinrich Solivo, was born on July 12, 1875, in Stuttgart. She spent part of her youth in Stuttgart and part in Unterhausen in Echaztal on the Aib, where her father had built the first hosiery mill in Wlirttemburg. 

 Although very religious from her youth, she found no fulfilment in the Protestant beliefs. It is therefore readily understandable that she was indelibly impressed when she met, in 1912, the American dentist, Edwin Fisher — the first Baha to come to Germany — who told her about the new world religion. 

 Of her meeting with Edwin Fisher in her home, she said: "I have experienced this day either that which was sent to earth by the Most Glorious, or I have encountered a dreamer." When 'Abdu'l-Baha visited Stuttgart a few months later in April, 1913, she was able to experience through her personal encounters with the Master the greatest bounty of her life. She was granted the inestimable honor of receiving 'Abdu'l-Baha as a guest in her home. 

 From that time forward the life of Alice Schwarz was completely dedicated to the Baha Faith. She gave numerous public talks and made translations of the Writings. In her service  she enjoyed the wholehearted support of her husband, Albert Schwarz (deceased 1931'), who also embraced the Cause and dedicated his life to its service. All the members of the 1 The Rahd't World, vol. xv, p. 264.

  family were honored with personal Tablets from the Master. In 1922 the couple undertook a pilgrimage to Haifa where they met the Guardian. In 1936 Alice Schwarz again made a pilgrimage in company with other friends. 

 For many years Mr. and Mrs. Schwarz were members of the Spiritual Assembly of Stuttgart and both were closely associated with the initial propagation of the Faith in Germany and Austria. Shortly after World War I, she founded the Sonne der Wahreit (Sun of Truth), the first German Baha'i periodical. 

 She also actively  participated in the establishment of the Baha'i Publishing Trust and translated and published Baha'i articles in collaboration with Heinrich 

JAger.                     

 During the Nazi regime the Baha'i library which was maintained at her home was confiscated and she was able to preserve only a few of the Writings. 

 After her house and property were lost in air raids, she moved to her daughter's house in the Tyrol but as soon as conditions allowed she returned to her homeland in order to be of further service to the Faith. In an account of her life in this period a friend writes: "After World War H she worked with un-reduced interest in spreading the Baha'i mes

 sage. The two world disasters and the following events could not shake her faith in a better and more promising future. Thus she spent her last years under the loving care of her family, full of confidence in the future. She felt secure towards the end of her earthly life, remembering  the worlds of Baha'u'llah: "I have made death a messenger ofloy to thee.. 

 When she left this earth on April 7, 1965, Alice Schwarz left in her native land and far beyond its borders the memory of a woman who was unshakable in her Faith, loyal, energetic and brave. 

 At her gravesidethefollowing prayer, written for her by 'Abdu'l-Baha, was read in accordance  with her wish: "To the Handmaid of God, Mrs. Alice Schwarz, above her is Baha'u'llah 0  God! 0 God! In truth this Thy handmaid is dressed in Thy holy fragrances, and she has turned her face towards Thy merciful countenance.  Destine for her all good in Thy Kingdom and let Thy blessings descend upon this noble family. 

 Allow the lights of Thy mercy to surround them in all eternity and grant them the shield of Thy protection and support. 

 Verily, Thou art the Charitable, the Mighty and the Giver of all Mercy."

      'ABBAS SHAHQULI             

 1906 — 1967 Colonel 'Abbas ~~hquIi, who served for many years as secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia, passed away in TibrAn on January 18, 1967. An account of his funeral was broadcast on television and six thousand people, Baha as well as members of other Faiths, attended the funeral ceremony held in the Baha'i cemetery in that city. 

 In 1927 a group of Baha in Rasht a city in northwestern Persia, who were aware of Colonel $~Ahqu1i's concern with social problems  and his broadmindedness and natural capacity, slowly introduced him to the 

Teachings  of Baha'u'llah.

 Through reading the Baha'i Writings he came to an intellectual acceptance of the Teachings as representing the solution to the social problems of the age. As 

      'Abbas Shdquli              

  his study deepened, however, his heart became illumined with the light of faith and he became a faithful, devoted and outstanding follower of Baha'u'llah. 

 He placed at the service of the Cause his many talents and capacities which became further refined and polished as time went on. He served in various administrative capacities with competence and zeal and was a distinguished secretary of the National Spiritual  Assembly for many years. He brought to his task perseverance, interest, sincerity, devotion and fidelity. Sacrificially, he worked late into the night in performance of his duties. 

 The effective organization of the National Pioneering Committee of Persia and the successful  fulfillment of the forty-five month pioneering plan were due in large measure to the cooperation, guidance and successive travels of Colonel ~~hqu1i. The Baha'i community  of Tihdn will never forget the courageous  measures he took for the safeguarding of the Dahd'fs of that city and its suburbs during the outbreak of persecutions in 1955 — 56. He also rendered extremely valuable services through his indefatigable efforts in assisting the Baha'i Publishing Committee of Ir&n to enrich

                     IN MEMORIAM

  its range of literature through the addition of new books and articles and the reprinting in large quantities of out-of-stock and rare material. 

 In addition to his gifts in the administrative field, Colonel ShAliquli was a capable teacher and until the last days of his life found his greatest happiness in this activity. 

 In his sixtieth year, at the height of his career as a distinguished attorney and officer in the military, he succumbed to a brain hemorrhage. 

 After reciting with fervor and devotion a prayer he favoured, he slipped into a coma from which he did not recover. 

 Informed of his passing, the Universal House of Justice cabled:

       ALA SOMMPRAU               
(Alevtina Borissowna Proskoriakowa)

  1911 — 1967 Those who knew Ala Sommerau have a lasting memory of her vibrant and dynamic personality, her keen intelligence and capacity, her enthusiasm  and generosity and particularly her deep love of Godand ofherfellowman. 

 Russian by birth, she came to Switzerland and through her marriage to a Swiss adopted the nationality of that country, but she retained a great love for the country of her birth. 

 In 1955 she encountered the Baha'i Faith at Lausanne. 

 She often said that this was the most important event of her life. In hearing the words of the Baha'i speaker her soul recognized at once thepoweroftheMessage of Baha'u'llah. Without hesitation she accepted the truth of the new Revelation and became a member of the 

Lausanne community. At     

 this time she was experiencing great personal problems but with characteristic tenacity and spiritual vigor she arose to conquer them. 

 Ala carried in her heart, like a precious treasure, the joy she found in her Faith. She plunged deeply into the Writings and was stunned by their clarity and infinite wisdom. She realized that there was no time to be lost and determined that she would spend her life in service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 In 1955, but a few months after finding the Faith, she made a pilgrimage to the Hoiy Land. It was an unforgettable experience and she was deeply touched by the warm welcome extended to her by the Guardian. 

 He reinforced and heightened her desire to serve and assigned her the task of contacting Russian refugees living in Europe. 

 Since that day to the end of her life, she worked constantly to accomplish this goal. She translated into Russian a booklet designed to serve as a basic introduction to the Teachings.  She was in contact with the editor of a Russian magazine published in Argentina and subscribed to by Russians all over the world. In this way she was able to accomplish the wish of Shoghi Effendi. She asked Anne Lynch to collaborate in the preparation of monthly articles for this publication. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha was Ala's cherished Exemplar and Standard. To pray with her was always a heart-moving experience. Her loving heart and


<p380>
380                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

  sympathy embraced all she encountered. In speaking of the Cause her words were charged sometimes with excitement, sometimes with tenderness, and the strength and sincerity of her own conviction attracted many waiting souls. 

 She was an example to everyone in her submissiveness in periods of illness and suffering,  as well as in her modesty of lifestyle. Ala had an optimistic and courageous character, a feeling heart and a deep love for humankind; she cheered the depressed and moderated negative influences in any gathering she attended. 

 During her last years, despite poor health, Ala visited Russia twice. 

 On her last visit, exercising much tact, she made contact with interested groups and experienced the joy of finding souls who warmly responded to the message of redemption for a suffering humanity.  The Russian spirit was ready, and Ala understood it. Ala Sommerau will never be forgotten. She was given the mission by Shoghi Effendi of taking the Message of Baha'u'llah to the Russians and her obedience is surely her crown. 
                           
      FDWARD STRUVEN             

 1875 — 1965 Edward Struven, well known to and loved by Baha who visited the Mother Temple of the West during the years it was in process of construction,  was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1875, the son of Dietrich Struven, a ship's chandler, and Rose Klaus Struven. 

 He was a graduate in engineering from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where in 1904 he became acquainted with Mary Wood and Mrs. Lua Getsinger. 

 Lua Getsinger imparted to him the Message of Baha'u'llah and confirmed him in the Baha'i Faith in that year. 

  In 1912, Edward Struven    

 was among those privileged ones who welcomed 'Abdu'l-Baha upon His arrival in New York. 

 In 1923, he was asked to assist in the construction of the Temple and in that year began a long period of dedicated  and uninterrupted service in Wilmette. Long before any superstructure appeared above the foundation Mr. Struven conveyed to visitors to the Temple site an image of the glorious edifice that would soon begin to 

      Edward Struven             

  dominate the landscape and lakefront area of Wilmette. 

 As early as 1927, Mr. Struven was the recipient of letters from the Guardian underscoring the importance of the House of Worship. 

 In a letter dated October, 1927, Shoghi Effendi wrote to Mr. Struven: 

    "My dear Coworker: I      

 will continue to pray for the steady development and consolidation of the newly-established centre at Wilmette. May it grow in radiance and power, cement the bonds that should unite the East and the West in the Baha'i world, and raise, as no Assembly has as yet raised, the call to arise and hasten the construction of God's Universal House of Worship. 

  On April 29, 1929, the Guardian wrote: "I wish to add these few words in person as a token of my love and keen appreciation of your efforts. 12 will pray for you and your wife at the sacred Shrines that you may help advance the interests of the Temple and fulfil your heart's desire.~~ On November 7,1933, the Guardian wrote to Mr. Struven expressing gratitude for his

IN MEMORIAM                381

  ''meritorious efforts and services in connection with our glorious and sacred Temple", and on May 15, 1937, assured hin~ of "loving appreciation of the many services you are rendering our beloved Faith at such an important centre." 

 About the mid-forties Mr. Struven retired from active service at the 

Baha House of Worship     

 and briefly visited Arizona before settling in Florida where he continued to teach the Faith actively until his death on December 31, 1965, at the age of ninety. 

 In the concluding years of hislifehe had become Mmost blind, but never for a day did he cease to teach to others the Faith he loved so deeply and served with such devotion for more than half a century.

  'INAYATU'LLAII SUHRAII     

  Colonel Suhr&b was born into a family of learned and pious Muslims in IsfAh~n. His father, 1~4j~ Siyyid Zaynu'1-'Abidfn, accepted the Faith in his youth and because of being in a family of 'ulamAs he was under great pressure and suffered persecution from members of his family. On three occasions the home of 

IJAji Siyyid Zaynu'1-Abidfn

 was attacked and looted and he and his family of small children were under great difficulties. 

 The sufferings he endured in the path of God were rewarded by 'Abdu'l-Baha who sent him a beautiful Tablet consoling him and assuring him that soon these difficulties would be turned into comfort and would produce beneficial results. In the Tablet the Master reminded him that the tempestuous winds and storms of the winter give way to a beautiful harvest of flowers in the spring. 

    As a child Colonel SuhrAb  

 was an eyewitness to the acts of heroism of his father. He has recorded in his diary how he and his brother were frightened in these upheavals and feared for their lives, Ills father at last had to leave his native town. 

 After having made pilgrimage to KarbilA, he requested permission to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Holy Land. He stayed several months in the Holy Land and has written a beautiful memoir of those days spent in the presence of the Master. In the absence of his father, Colonel SuhrAb, who was the eldest son, accepted the responsibility of caring for his mother and three younger brothers. 

Because                    
  'Indyatu'lldli Suhrdb      

  their properties were in the hands of enemies they hadlittle with which to sustain themselves. In spite of the difficult circumstances in which they lived, the parents of Colonel Suhrt±b educated their children. Colonel SuhrAb has written poignant biographies of his father and grandfather which graphically depict the situation of the Baha'is of Persia in those difficult days. 

 Although physically frail, Colonel Suhrdb manifested a powerful spirit and learned valuable lessons in the school of adversity. 

 In his twenty-fifth year he was invited to serve in the army in an administrative capacity. He achieved the rank of Colonel. 

 His career in the service of his government reflected his honesty, sincerity and integrity. 

 Colonel SuhrAb has an enviable record of Baha'i service, He was one of the first members of the Spiritual Assembly of hfdhAn and served that institution for forty years. He undertook numerous travel teaching trips throughout Iran. 'Abdu'l-Baha, in one of His Tablets to him, praised Colonel SubrAb for traveling to a remote tribal area and blessed him for his endeavour.


<p382>
382                 THE BAHA'I WORLD
     In 1939 Colonel SulirAb    

 was sent to Europe to make purchases for his government. He sought permission to make pilgrimage at this time. Tn a letter written through his secretary on September 4, 1939, Shoghi Effendi advised him that the troubled situation in the Holy Land made it unwise to come at that time. Instead, the beloved Guardian requested that he visit the friends in France and England, and that he visit Miss Marion Jack, the lone pioneer in Sophia, Bulgaria. 

 On his return to IrAn he served the Cause with renewed vigor and dedication. 

 Some years later, Colonel Suhr&b had the bounty of coming on pilgrimage. 

 Colonel SuhrAb was a wonderful teacher and was a well-loved and popular instructor of the Baha'i youth. He compiled numerous study courses, articles and books many of which have been published. 

 In the early spring of 1968 he was summoned to the Throne of Eternity. 
                           
    SAIALALA TAMASESE          

 19 12 — 1965  

Sajalala Tamasese Lealofi  
II was born at Vaimoso,    

Western Samoa, on December 

 1, 1912. Although descended from one of the royal families of Samoa, he was a very humble person and was known for his kindness and great love for all people. He was educated at the Seventh 

Day Adventist Theological  

 College at Vailoa, Saluafata, but was not happy in his religion and continued his search for truth. 

 He studied the Mormon teachings but, still unsatisfied,  he decided to attend no church and to study the Christian Bible himself 

   Late in 1955, Sajalala     

 and his wife, To'alima learned of the Baha'i Faith through their daughter, Fuatino, who was employed by a Persian family who had pioneered to Samoa. Sajalala's interest in the Teachings grew rapidly and he returned again and again as a guest to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ni'mat 'A1&i until he proved to his own satisfaction that Baha'u'llah is the Manifestation of God for this day. 

 He then commenced to teach his wife and children who all became Baha'is. 

     Every Sunday Sajalala      

 accompanied Mr. Suhayl 'AIA'i on teaching trips, walking from village to village, serving as translator, and telling those who showed interest about the 

    Salalata Tamasese          
                           
Teachings of Baha'u'llah.  

 Although the first Spiritual Assembly was formed in Apia in 1957, soon, as a result of the visits to the villages, groups and assemblies were formed in Sina-moga,  Mega, Leauva'a, Nofoali'i and other places. 

 Sajalala interpreted for the Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga during his visit to Western Samoa in 1958 during which large proclamation meetings were held in the villages of Leauva'a and Fasito'otai with hundreds attending. 

 He also made a significant contribution by translating into Samoan some of the IBah&i prayers, a portion of The Hidden Words and other Writings. 

 In later years he fell ill and for two years before his death he was not able to participate actively in teaching. But his spirit was ever strong and he continued to encourage his family and taught and deepened the friends who visited him. On the return to Samoa of Mr. and Mrs. Suhayl 'AIA'f, he said: "I am a Baha and I will remain a Baha'i. Now you have returned I can die." 

 A few weeks later, on September 25, 1965, he passed to the AbhA Kingdom, the first indigenous Samoan to believe in Baha'u'llah and


<p383>
IN MEMORIAM              serve Him all the years of his life. Because of his rank, his funeral was attended by representatives of noble families, leading chiefs and church dignitaries. Despite pressure brought to bear by clergy and relatives his wife steadfastly insisted upon a Baha'i burial service, the simplicity, beauty and dignity of which deeply impressed those who attended and further enhanced the prestige of the Faith. Thus, even in death, Sajalala Tamasese served the Cause of God which he assisted in establishing in his island home in the midmost heart of the Pacific. 

  "In the East the light of His Revelation bath broken; in the West have appeared the signs of His dominion. 

 Should they attempt to conceal its light on the continent, it will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean, and, raising its voice, proclaim 'lam the life-giver of the world!"' 

 KATHERINE KNIGHT TRUE   

 1893 — 1963  

Katherine Knight True   

 and her twin brother, Kenneth Knight True, were born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 2, 1893. 

 The attachment between these two children was very deep and Katherine herself seemed to wonder at her sense of loss, which continued throughout her life, from the time of Kenneth's sudden death when he was only seven years old. 

 Her mother's early interest in and acceptance of the Baha'i Faith, the first mention of which in the Western Hemisphere had been made at the International 

Congress of Religions   

 in Chicago just days after Katherine's birth, was undoubtedly of profound influence throughout her life. 

 How early this influence became evident  is manifested in an exchange of correspondence between the beloved 

Master and Katherine.   

 When but nine years of age she wrote the following letter to 'Abdu'l-Baha: To the Dear Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha: 

        I-jI~ji Mirza Ijlasan  

 promised to take me to the Holy City, Acca, in his robe to see the Beloved Master. 

 I am learning The Hidden Wordy of the 

Blessed Perfection      

 and desire to live according to His commands. 

 I supplicate to you to pray to God for me to fill me with 

His Holy Spirit.        

 I ask you, won't you please send me a Tablet in your own handwriting. 

 Give my love to all your Household and dear Mirza Assad'u'Ilah. 

  Your little maidservant, 

     Katherine True          

 Chicago, Iii., April 11, 1903." 

  About two months later this "little maidservant" received a much-treasured Tablet from her beloved Master, in His own handwriting  and addressed to "The maidservant of God, Kathryn True, the revered." 

 "0 Thou who art attracted to God! 

 I send this letter written by my own hand, that thou mayest thank God, thy Lord, the Baha'u'llah             Supreme, grow in happiness in the love of God and be kindled by the fire of His love, chanting verses ofgreetings and thanks, andbe quicken-edby  the breezes of life blown from the garden of the knowledge of God." 

  Again, some sixteen years later when Katherine was deciding on her life profession she wrote to 'Abdu'l-Baha about her desire to study medicine, asking for His counsel in this decision. 

 His reply came in the following Tablet dated March31, 1919, and translated by Shoghi Effendi who was then serving as the Master's secretary: 

        "He is God.             
o beloved daughter!     

 Your letter dated December 29th, 1919 arrived. 

 From it, it became known that with a firm resolution you were determined to serve the world of humanity. 

 One of the Divine Teachings is that man should be the source of a benevolent cause amongst the creature.~ and if it be universal good, all the better. 

 The study of medicines is highly acceptabk andpraiseworthy. 

 With allthypower endeavor that thou mayest attain the utmost proficiency in this art and thus serve the world of humanity. 

  This loving and inspiring Tablet from the Master, so characteristic of His sincere concern for all who turned to Him, cleared up any remaining  questions in regard to her final decision,  for in His Message she found not only the


<p384>
384                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 approval of her choice in study but the encouragement and assurance she most needed, as well as the direction and purpose to which her life work should be dedicated; namely, "service to the world of humanity". 

 Ignoring the serious problems of health caused by a prolonged illness when about twelve years old, Katherine began her years of intensive study, astonishing her family and friends by her persistence and faithfulness in completing the difficult stages of her professional  education, taking her pre-medics at Northwestern University and finally in 1926 receiving her degrees of Bachelor of Science, Master of 

Science and Doctorate     

 in Medicine from the University of Pittsburg. Her high standing in her profession was later attested by the invitation which she received, in 1941, to become a Fellow in the American College of Surgeons, on an occasion when two women with some five hundred men received this honor. 

 During most of her professional life, while practising on the North Shore of Chicago, Dr. True was closely associated with the Mary Thompson Hospital in Chicago, and served in various administrative capacities such as Head of the Surgery Department and President of the Medical 

Staff.                    

 While unusually dedicated to her profession, Katherine always found time for her continuous  activities in the Baha Faith. In her own community she was deeply interested in the development of the Local Spiritual Assembly, serving as its chairman for several years and as one of its most effective teachers both in her own firesides and in public meetings. 

 Later, her Baha'i activities were more in the national and international fields. 

 From 1945 though 1948 Katherine devoted most of her time to her work on the National Teaching Committee, acting as its chairman in the years 1947 and 1948. Elected to the National Spiritual Assembly at RhjvAn 1956, she served as member of that body to Ri4IvAn 1960, contributing  especially to one of the specific goals of the Ten Year Crusade, namely, the establishment  of the Baha'i Home for the Aged, the first dependency of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Wilmette. Because of her background of experience, she played an important part in this project though all its difficult stages — the selection of its location, its architectural plans, 

  Katherine Knight True     

  the construction of the building and the organization of the operation of the Home after its completion. 

 For a number of years afterwards  she was a very active member of its Admissions Committee. 

 One of the most important of Katherine~ s services to the Faith was her very able chairmanship of the Arrangements Committee for the historic All-America 

Intercontinental Teaching 

 Conference commemorating the Centenary of the inception of the Mission of Baha'u'llah, held in Chicago and Wilmette, April 29 — May 6, 1953, and which included the momentous dedication of the House of Worship  on May 2. 

 Of all her various endeavors for the Cause, the one she seemed to particularly enjoy was that of the establishment of the Faith in the countries of Western Europe. As member and vice-chairman of the European Teaching Committee throughout its period of operation, from 1946 to 1963, she contributed richly to the achievement of the goals set by the beloved Guardian in this international field of action. It was during these years that she received (October 4, 1950) the following encouraging


<p385>
IN MEMORIAM                 385

 and warmly cherished message from the 

Guardian:                  

  "May the Beloved bless your deeply appreciated endeavours, reward you for your labours, remove all obstacles from your path, and enable you to extend continually the range of your activities. 
    Your true brother,         

         Shoghi"                    

  It was Katherine's joyous privilege to make several pilgrimages to Haifa during the Guardian's lifetime. Of special interest and import was her first visit when she accompanied her mother to the Holy Land in the very early part of 1922, soon after the deeply lamented passing of the beloved Master. Each of her journeys to the Holy Land must surely have had its own particular place in the storehouse of her experiences, even to her last visit in November 1952 when the Guardian permitted her to accompany her mother on a very special occasion arranged by the Guardian for this Hand of the Cause of God, 

Corinne True.              

 The memory of Katherine True will, I believe, remain vivid in the hearts of her family and of her many, many friends even more for what she was than for what she accomplished in her rich and full life, for the rare qualities which she possessed and which combined to make her such a uniquely beautiful individual. Although gifted with an excellent mind, a deep and clear thinker known for her sound judgment and intellectual integrity, she constantly demonstrated a unique balance of her mental powers and the dictates of her beautiful spirit, her sincere compassion, loving understanding and extraordinary kindness. 

 One of her most conspicuous endowments was her delightful and ever-present sense of humor, completely free of all caustic or sarcastic implications, and contagious  to those who experienced it. Unconscious of her charm and attraction for people, she was extremely humble to the point of being, really, very shy, a surprising quality in one so gifted. 

 Dr. True passed away quite unexpectedly on September 26, 1963, from a sudden and virulent  attack of leukemia. The great longing of her heart had been granted to her, the privilege and joy of living long enough to care for her beloved mother during her declining years. Katherine's professional skill and knowledge, her most loving and tender care were poured out unstintingly upon this precious, most cherished of all of her patients, up to the moment of Mother True's passing to the 

AbM Kingdom in April 1961. 

 To those who had been privileged to be associated with Katherine Knight True and to know her intimately, it seemed that the hopes expressed by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His cherished Tablets to her had been beautifully fulfilled: "With all thy power endeavor that thou mayest attain the utmost proficiency in this art and may thus serve the world of humanity." 

 Katherine's life, as her beloved Master had directed in this early Tablet had indeed been a continuous service to the world of humanity.

     REGINALD TURVEY            

  1882 — 1968 

Reginald Ernest George     

 Turvey, the artist and "spiritual father of South Africa" ascended to the AbliA Kingdom from Durban, 

South Africa, on March     
2, 1968.                   

 The Turvey family traces its ancestors back to 1172 to Ireland, and through various families honored by royalty to Edward Turvey, Reg's artist grandfather, who headed a party of settlers from London to South Africa in 1820 and finally settled in Ladybrand, 

Orange Free State.         

 Reg was born in Ladybrand on August 29, 1882. His father who owned farms and operated a trading store was a member of the Raad, the first parliament of the Orange Free State. 

 Reg was educated at Grey College, Bloemfontein. 

 He did not complete school because his housemaster discovered his marked artistic talent and persuaded his father to send him to London for art training. In London he studied under Henry Tonks from 1903 — 07 at the Slade School of Art where he received an award for painting, and at the London School of 

Art.                       
    While attending the Slade  

School Reg met Bernard     

 Leach, Britain's master potter, who became his lifelong friend. In 1910 the two men attempted to open an art school in Japan but the venture failed and Reg returned to South Africa and barely made a living teaching art in


<p386>
386                 THE BAnAl WORLD

 Durban. His father decided he could not go on being a starving artist so he bought him a farm in Kenya and sent Reg off to learn to be a farmer. 

 The artist was not a farmer, however, and the farm made very little. 

 After four years Reg returned to South Mrica where he became very ill for many months. Eventually he recovered and began to paint. In 1922 he sold the farm in Kenya and used the money to get married and return to England to study and paint. 

     At Dartington both Reg     

 and Bernard Leach made friends with the American painter, Mark Tobey, and heard from him of the life and teachings of Baha'u'llah. During all the years of their friendship both Reg and Bernard Leach had been searching for truth as well as beauty and they had spent endless hours discussing it. Reg at the time was interested in Theosophy. It was not long after Mark Tobey had told him of the Message of Baha'u'llah that he accepted. This was in 1936. 

 In 1939 the family returned to South Africa. Reg continued to paint and hold private exhibitions, but his paintings did not sell well. During these difficult years in Johannesburg Reg tried to make contact with other RaM is in South Africa and although there were several, including a group established by Fanny Knob-loch  in nearby Pretoria, he failed to locate them. The Administrative Order of the Faith was not yet established in that part of the world and Reg was not in comnanuication with the World Centre. 

 There is little doubt, according  to his friends, that had Reg not been sustained  by the teachings of the Baha'i Faith during those lean years he would have left the arts. He clung to and drew inspiration from the Baha concept that the true artist is a servant of mankind. 

 In 1953, life suddenly changed. The Hands of the Cause MiisA EanThi and Dhikru'llAh KhAdem and their wives visited Baha'i Centers throughout Africa at the request of Shoghi Effendi. For an entire week Reg found himself surrounded by Baha'i love and was uplifted by the news that soon, as part of the Ten Year Crusade, a group of Baha'! pioneers would be arriving to reestablish the Faith in South Africa and lay a solid foundation for its administrative functioning. At last his many years of isolation and loneliness were broken. 

 Within a few months Mr. and Mrs. Harry Ford and Reginald Turvey (self portrait) Mr. and Mrs. William Sears' and family arrived in Johannesburg. Reg was invited to live on the Sears farm where he found warm companionship, the inspiration of regular Baha'i activities and was provided with a studio in which to work. Thus began the most fruitful period of Reg's artistic life and the full maturing  of his talent. His paintings took on a more abstract and mystical aspect. 

 Under the direction of the Guardian teaching work began among the African people and Reg enthusiastically participated. He especially enjoyed serving as chauffeur for African teachers who needed transport and he made frequent trips to the remote rural areas of South Africa, Swaziland and Basutoland. Although he was not a public speaker, the Africans loved his gentle spirit and affectionately termed him "Uncle Reg". 

 In 1956 Reg made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. At last the long-isolated believer achieved his heart's desire. His notes taken at the time record a deep appreciation of the beauty of the Shrines and a warm and tender love for~ Shoghi Effendi: a wonderful 1 Mr. Sears was appointed a Hand of the Cause in

IN MEMORIAM

  387 person; he has a great sense of humor, a great kindness in his eyes. ." Reg's journal indicates that the Guardian's table-talk revolved around the purification of mankind, the suffering humanity must endure in preparation for an era of unity, love and justice. He reports that the Guardian explained that the Faith had faded in South Africa mainly because the Administrative Order had not yet been firmly established in the world and that the establishment  of the 

Administrative Order      

 on a secure foundation would prevent "a reversion to a virgin state". 
   It was while Reg was in   

Haifa that Shoghi Effendi 

 recognized the steadfastness and pure spirit of this believer and named him "the spiritual father of South Africa". 

 After returning from pilgrimage Reg continued  to serve faithfully on the Spiritual Assembly of Johannesburg and he continued to paint prolifically. 

 The year 1963 was a particularly happy one for him. One of his fondest hopes was fulfilled through a reunion with his fellow artists and friends, Bernard Leach and Mark Tobey, when they met at the 

World Congress in London. 

 Reg carried with him three of his abstract paintings to show to his old friends. 

 Between sessions of the Congress, and for several days afterwards, Reg haunted the art galleries with his companions and related afterwards how much he enjoyed their discussion of the significance of the New Day ushered in by the Baha'i revelation. 

 Upon returning to South Africa a one-man exhibition of Reg's paintings at the Lidchi Gallery brought him the recognition that had been delayed for almost sixty years. In that same year, as if he knew his life's work had been completed, he laid down his brushes, never to lift them again. 

 His eyesight deteriorated further  and he suffered an almost total loss of hearing. Creeping arthritis had already gnarled his right hand. Reg withdrew within himself in serenity. 

 ills last days were spent quietly in a nursing home where he enjoyed frequent visits from those who loved and admired him. 

 Reg lived the Baha'i teachings and is spoken of by his fellow artists and colleagues as a man who was "courteous, gentle and serene, firm, original, spiritual, mystical, honest, trusting, modest, genuine and a man ofintegrity". 

 He is a man of history, a man who lived his life for tomorrow. His paintings are now widely dis tributed in outstanding private collections in South Africa, in all the major art galleries, and in collections as far afield as Germany, England and America. When the significance of his Baha'i life in South Africa is understood, Reg's work will speak to generations to come. 

 Reginald Turvey was a fine artist who relied upon God and the deep spirit within for his inspiration. 

 He was never without his treasured, wellthumbed prayer book. The steadfastness of faith of "the spiritual father of South Africa" assures his eternal progress in the spiritual world. 

 He passed away peacefully in his eighty-fifth year. 

 At his simple Baha'i burial service was read a Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the opening words of which define the lodestar of Reg's life: "In this great dispensation, art is identical with an act of worsl4p and this is a clear text of the Blessed Perfection.

  1905 — 1966 

Baha'i Kayldiusraw VatankhAh

 was born in Na~rAbAd, Yazd, IrAn, in 1905 of Zoroastrian background. 

 He settled in India when a youth of nineteen years. 

 Immediately after becoming a IBahA'i in 1931 he made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He deeply loved Shoghi Effendi and wished never to part from him. 

 The Guardian consoled him by saying that his service to the Cause would be the fulfillment of that wish. His exemplary obedience to the wishes of Shoghi Effendi and his willingness to respond to every need of the Cause despite considerations of health and limited finances were the hallmark of the sacrificial services rendered by Mr. Vatankhdh during the balance of his life. 

 In 1943, in response to the call of the Guardian for the Baha'is to disperse from the larger cities, 

Mr. VatanklThh left Bombay

 and settled in Sholapur where he contributed greatly to the teaching work. An even more significant phase of his Baha'i activity commenced in 1962 when he arose to serve as a teacher in areas where large masses were responding to the Teachings,

Vatankhdh               

  a task to which he dedicated his full time. With unswerving confidence he travelled to remote villages bringing the Faith to rich and poor, literate and illiterate, wherever his steps were guided. 

 His greatest happiness was in teaching. Despite serious health problems he could not be persuaded to remain away from the teaching field for more than a day or two at a time. 

 In the period 1962 — 66, Mr. Vatankh&h visited more than three hundred villages in the Sholapur area and other parts of 

Maharaslitra State      

 and also journeyed to Hyderabad and Orissa. 

 In July 1966 he travelled fifteen hundred kilometers to assist the Spiritual Assembly of Kota develop a teaching plan to establish the Faith in area villages. 

 He rested briefly at the insistence of the friends, but then immediately arose to undertake teaching journeys to the outlying villages. Accompanied by the Baha of Kota he visited the village of Tirath on July 10. 

 It was his last teaching exploit. He fell ill the following day and was confined to bed in the care of a doctor. The next day he rallied briefly and conversed jubilantly with the friends, inviting them to accompany him that evening to open another village to the Faith, 

TIlE BAHA'I WORLD      

  but within a few hours he passed peacefully away. 

 His last words before slipping into unconsciousness were: "Which village will we visit this evening?" 

 The Universal House     

 of Justice expressed its sorrow at the loss of this outstanding teacher by cabling:

 1901 — 1964 In the year 1920, John and Louise Bosch, two early American believers, took an extended journey to the French 

Polynesian Islands      

 of the Pacific, settling in Papeete, Tahiti, for a period of five months. Their purpose was to bring the 

     Message of Baha'u'llah  

 to the inhabitants of __     this island, so much loved by the French impressionist pressionist Paul Gauguin, and by him defined a veritable paradise. 

 During their stay in Papeete they became well acquainted with Ariane Drollet, then seventeen years old, who was the first 

Tahitian                

 to embrace the Baha'i Faith. A photograph of Mile. Drollet standing between Louise and John Bosch appears in The Baha'i World, vol. iv, p. 349. 
     Some time later, Mile.  

 Drollet visited the United States and was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Bosch at their home in Geyserville, California, for approximately a year. During this time she became acquainted with many 

     Baha in California.   

 Mter her return to Tahiti she went to France where she married and lived until the end of World War II.

  EDUARDO DURANTE VIERA      
   First African Martyr       

 1921 — 1966  

Eduardo Durante Viera      

 was born in Portuguese Guinea, West Africa. 

 He was well educated, charming, liberal-minded and pro-foundily  spiritual. 

 His noble qualities made him a popular figure among his people. He held a prominent position in the government of the colony and was often called upon to tender an address of welcome to important visitors to Bissau, the capital of Portuguese Guinea, on behalf of the government. 

 He served as a member of the church council in Bissan. 

 Mr. Viera learned of the Baha'i Faith while on a brief visit to Lisbon during the course of the Ten Year Crusade and became an eager student of the Writings of Baha'u'llah. Quickly he embraced the Cause and became an enthusiastic, staunch and knowledgeable believer.  The friends in Lisbon warmly remember the pleasure and stimulation he brought to the meetings. 

 On his return to Bissau, Mr. Viera severed his affiliation with the church and proceeded with courage and vigor to promote the Baha'i Teachings among his countrymen. 

 The first to embrace the Faith was his wife who recognized the truth of the Message of Baha'u'llah after a period of keen study and meditation. 

 Soon a Baha'i community of fifteen members was established in Bissau and a Baha'i center in one of its suburbs. 

 A Baha'i friend in Lisbon records: "hi those days we used to receive magnificent letters from Mr. Viera. 

 They were highly inspiring and instructive. Wheneverhislettersarrivedlwould share them with the friends who also drew much pleasure and enlightenment from them. However, as time went on, his letters grew more infrequent and fitful and eventually stopped altogether. He had often made some passing reference to the hardships and obstacles he encountered in his own work, and spoke of himself as being in a distressing position; but we in Portugal could hardly grasp the gravity of the situation, and when his letters stopped altogether, we grewvery anxious about him. 

 Although urged by the clergy to do so, Mr. Viera refused to apostatize his Faith. A brief, harsh interval followed. He was summarily dismissed from his post and deprived of all the benefits and privileges he had hitherto enjoyed. Faced with the need of providing for his wife and seven children, one of them a victim of paralysis, Mr. Viera established a travel agency and offered his services as legal advisor to the native population of his home town. Lie sustained a crushing disappointment when his application for a visa to enable him to attend the World Congress in London in 1963 was curtly rejected. His Baha'i teaching activity continued unabated. The clergy instigated the authorities to take severe repressive measures: his house was raided, his Baha'i books and literature were confiscated, and he was forbidden  to hold meetings in his home. 

 Moreover, a strict censorship was imposed on all his correspondence.  Eventually all his letters were intercepted. 
On several occasions       

Mr. Viera

  was arrested by the police on frivolous pretexts, was detained, maltreated and brutally beaten. This mounting tide of trials served only to increase the tenacity of his loyalty to the Cause of Baha'u'llah and to give fresh impetus to his heroic spirit. 

 Mr. Viera's final arrest, on a charge of subversive political activity, took place on March 11, 1966, following a period of increasing pressure  and harassment. A cloud of obscurity surrounds the uncertain circumstances of his death in prison on March 31, 1966, the first African Baha to lay down his life as a martyr for the Cause of Baha'u'llah, his sublime heroism thus immortalizing his name in the annals of the Eaith. 

 An account of the tragic events of this period was recorded by Mrs. Viera: "At about 4 a.m. on March lithe police suddenly broke into the house and ordered my husband to keep quiet and not to move. After a thorough search of the house they permitted him to change his clothes and they took him away. We could not have contact with him. 

 Even when we were permitted to take him some food through the help of the prison physician, we were not allowed to see him. About ten days later the police brought him home to obtain the key to his office. 

 It was one o'clock in the morning. 

 This was the last time he saw the children. 

 His office was entered and the papers and books confiscated. One day when II took food to him the doctor informed me that he would be taken to another room and I could glimpse my husband passing by. 

 That was the last time I saw him. The officials ordered me to leave. 

 After his death, through the intervention of the doctor, I was permitted to prepare his body for Baha burial. While washing we found his body full of the signs of tortures, especially on his head. 

 But we had a IBahA'i funeral and prayers... 

 Final messages for his wife and children were found crudely scratched with a sharp instrument on the metal biscuit box in which Mrs. Viera had transported food to the prison: "Tonia: This was the way of destiny. All is terminated. 

 Love your fellowman and raise your children with love. Love everybody. 

 Forgive  all the wrongs I have done. Be able to face life with naturalness. 

 Goodbye, and I wish you a long life,    Durante 29 — 3 — 1966" 

   "Dear children: Always     

 be friendly towards all people. Do not have hate towards anyone. Life is eternal and it never ends; it finishes one cycle and begins another. Forgive all the wrongs of your father. May God protect you, 

     Durante 29 — 3 — 1966"         

  Whither can a lover go but to the land of his beloved? 

 and what seeker findeth rest away from his heart's desire? To the true lover reunion  is life, andseparation is death. ills breast is void ofpatience and his heart hathno peace. A myriad lives he would forsake to hasten to the abode of his beloved.

  'Jzzatu'llgh Zabil2 was born into a Baha'i family related to UAJI Mirza JAnI of K6shAn. His father passed away when he was oniy seven years of age and he was raised by his devoted and distinguished mother. At a very early age he displayed an aptitude for learning foreign languages, and developed a deep knowledge of the Faith. 

 While still a youth, he organized and taught deepening classes, and his interest in teaching youth continued to the end of his life.

 Many of the young

 who had the privilege of attending his classes have become pioneers and prominent teachers and servants of the Cause in various parts of the world. 

    Mr. Zabih          

 studied textile design and engineering in Europe and made a valuable contribution, particularly to the emerging Baha community of France, in stimulating and teaching the friends there, in a period when there were few DahA'i teachers available. 

 He was deeply loved by those outside the Baha community as well. 

In a               

 time of great unrest among laborers, his close and affectionate relationship with the workers in his textile factory and the respect in which they held him stood in marked contrast to conditions prevailing generally in similar organizations.

RECOGNITION OF THE BAHA'I FAITH

                  DOCUMENTATION

 THE Baha'i Faith has been officially recognized by governments — national, state, provincial and municipal — in more than three hundred countries, significant territories and islands of the world. 

 Previous volumes of The Baha'i World have printed hundreds of facsimiles of certificates, proclamations, clamations, statutes and other documents attesting recognition of the Faith in a variety of aspects such as the incorporation of its administrative institutions, authority to conduct Baha marriage ceremonies, and recognition of its Holy Days. 

 As the Faith grows the volume of documentation increases to the point where it is no longer possible to publish an exhaustive compilation of these documents. In this volume, therefore, are included only the certificates of incorporation of some of the National Spiritual Assemblies incorporated between RiQvAn 1963 and RhjvAn 1968, a few local incorporation certificates, and a few documents indicating other forms of civil recognition.

          2. FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION
 
               B~ CHARLOTTE M. LINFOOTi

  THE date of April 21, 1963, the first day of RiQv&n, year 120, the hundredth anniversary of the declaration by Baha'u'llah of His sacred mission, has now been recorded in history as the day that witnessed the birth of the Universal House of Justice, that supreme administrative body of the Baha'i Faith referred to in Baha'u'llah's  prophetic Tablet of Carmel and which Shoghi Effendi stated "is to be the exponent and guardian of that Divine Justice which can alone insure the security of, and establish the reign of law and order in, a strangely disordered world." 

 As early as November 5, 1961, the Hands of the Cause had called the First 

International Convention   

 of the Baha'i Faith at which the election of this crowning administrative institution  was to take place. The delegates were the five hundred and four members of the fifty-six National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies elected at their respective Annual Conventions in RiQv~n 1962, charged with the sacred privilege  and duty of voting for the nine members of the Baha'i world community who would comprise  the membership of the Universal House of Justice. 

 To enable the delegates to prepare themselves spiritually for their great responsibility, arrangements  had been made by the Hands of the Cause, with the cooperation of the International  Baha Council, for all to visit the several holy places on God's sacred mountain, Mt. Carmel in Haifa, and in its twin city, 'Akka. This was the greatest mass pilgrimage ever to have been made to the World Center of our Faith. For the five-day period, April 20 to April 24, the Shine of the BTh was closed to the public, thus making it possible for the delegates to visit this most sacred spot on Mt. Carmel to pray and meditate at any hour and as many times as they wished. 

 Also, on each of three evenings, a designated group of delegates spent more than two hours in the International Archives Building viewing the sacred relics and documents, beautifully Reprinted from U.S. Bahd'iNews, June, 1963. 

 preserved and arranged in accordance with the personal instructions of the beloved Guardian, and gaining a deeper understanding of the significance of this edifice which he said is the first of the several structures which will eventually  constitute the Ark referred to by 

Baha'u'llah  in His Tablet 
of Carmel and become the World

Administrative Center      

 of the World Order of Baha'u'llah whose beginnings trace back to the concluding years of the Heroic Age of the 

Faith.                     

 The election of the Universal House of Justice, designated by Shoghi Effendi as "the supreme legislative body of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah", took place on the morning of the first day of RiQv~n. 

 The manner in which it was carried out and the results were reported by the Hand of the Cause Paul E. Haney at the Most Great Jubilee a few days later, as follows: The election was held in the House of the Master and the Guardian in Haifa. 

 The delegates gathered and entered the main hail silently and all were in their designated places by 9.30 a.m. 

     The Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Rffl~fyyih

 Kh&num gave a brief address of welcome and explained the mechanics of the election. 

 There were two prayers only, preceding  the election itself The two hundred and eighty-eight members of the fifty-one 

National and Regional      

 Spiritual Assemblies present proceeded to fill out their ballot papers. 

 Ballots were received from every National and Regional Spiritual Assembly — fifty-six in all. Representatives were present from all but five of these fifty-six 

Assemblies.                

 In silence the roll was called, each National Assembly in alphabetical order. 

 The members present placed their ballots in the ballot box and those from absentee delegates were called and deposited by the chief tellers. 

 As the various Assemblies came forward, Mr. Haney commented, one was continuously impressed by the widely representative charac

  ter of the electors and that we "were privileged to witness one of the great events of history taking place before our eyes.~~ "When the balloting was completed," lie concluded, "every one felt that Baha'u'llah had indeed been present in that gathering and that a unique ~nd wonderful pattern had been estab-Ushed  for the world to marvel at and, in the fullness of time, to follow." 

 Following the casting of the ballots and the appointment of eighteen tellers representing as many countries, all the delegates except the tellers adjourned for luncheon. 

 In mid-after-noon  they gathered a second time at Baha'i where, in the beautiful gardens in front of the Shrine of Baha'u'llah, they, together with the believers who reside in and near the twin holy cities of 'Akka and Haifa, commemorated the Feast of RiQvAn, followed by another visit to the resting place of IBah~'u'1hh. 

 The thee-day convention resumed the following morning, and was opened by the Hand of the Cause 

Aniatu'I-BahA Rhlflyyih KhAnum.

 There were three sessions on each of the remaining two days, with a Hand of the Cause presiding and the discussion led by a different delegate. The discussions were very spirited, and while no formal resolutions were presented or adopted, all delegates took back to their national communities many valuable ideas which they may be able to incorporate in their own teaching and proclamation plans in the years ahead. 

 The results of the election were announced at the close of the morning session of the convention on April 22. The nine members were greeted and introduced by Abdu'l-Baha Rfllgyyih Kh~num and each believer present felt that he had witnessed not only the birth of an institution which would be regarded by posterity as the "last refuge of a tottering civilization" but also the beginning of a new and more glorious stage in the evoLution of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. This was indeed an occasion of great rejoicing in the community of the Most Great Name around the world and another historic and history-making step toward "that blissful consummation" envisioned  by the beloved Guardian in his message of April 1955 "when the shackles

       3. FIRST STATEMENT FROM THE UNIVERSAL
                  HOUSE OF JUSTICE
             Presented by DAVID HOFMAN

  on April30, 1963, at the World Congress All praise, 0 my God, be to Thee Who art the Source of all glory and majesty, of greatness and honour, of sovereignty and dominion, of loftiness and grace, of awe and power. Whomsoever Thou wiliest Thou causest to draw nigh unto the Most Great Ocean, and on whomsoever Thou desirest Thou conferrest the honour of recognizing Thy Most Ancient Name. Of all who are in heaven and on earth, none can withstand the operation of Thy sovereign Will. From all eternity Thou didyt rule the entire creation, and Thou wilt continue for evermore to exercise Thy dominion over all created things. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise. 

  BELOVED friends: On this glorious occasion, the celebration of the Most Great Jubilee, we raise our grateful thanks to Baha'u'llah for all His bounties showered upon the friends throughout the world. This historic moment marks at one and the same time the fulfilment of Daniel's prophecy, the hundredth anniversary of the Declarationof the Promised One of all ages, the termination of the first epoch of the Divine Plan of 'Abdu'l-Baha designed to establish the Faith of God in all the world, and the successful conclusion of our beloved Guardian's  world-encircling Crusade, enabling his lovers and loved ones everywhere to lay this glorious harvest of victory in his name at the feet of the Blessed 

Beauty. This Most Great Jubilee

 is the crowning victory of the life work of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Cause of God. He it was, and he alone, who unfolded the potentialities of the widely scattered, numerically  small, and largely unorganized Baha community which had been called into being during the Heroic Age of the Faith. 

 He it was who unfolded the grand design of God's Holy Cause; set in motion the great plans of teaching already outlined by 'Abdu'l-Baha; established the institutions and greatly extended the endowments  at the World Centre, and raised the Temples of America, Mrica, Australasia, and Europe; developed the Administrative Order of the Cause throughout the world; and set the ark of the Cause true on its course. He appointed the Hands of the Cause of God. 

 The paeans of joy and gratitude, of love and adoration which we now raise to the throne of Baha'u'llah would be inadequate, and the celebrations of this Most Great Jubilee in which, as promised by our beloved Guardian, we are now engaged would be marred, were no tribute paid at this time to the Hands of the Cause of God. For they share the victory with their beloved commander, he who raised them up and appointed them. They kept the ship on its course and brought it safe to port. The Universal House of Justice, witlipride and love, records on this supreme occasion its profound admiration for the heroic work which they have accomplished. 

 We do not wish to dwell on the appalling dangers which faced the infant Cause when it was suddenly deprived of our beloved Shoghi Effendi, but rather to acknowledge  with all the love and gratitude of our hearts the reality of the sacrifice, the labour, the self-discipline, the superb stewardship of the Hands of the Cause of God. We can think of no more fitting words to express our tribute to these dearly loved and valiant souls than to recall the words of Baha'u'llah Himself: "Light and glory, greeting and praise be upon the Hands of His Cause, through whom the light of longsuffering hath shone forth, and the declaration of authority is proven of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Independent; and through whom the sea of bestowal bath moved, and the breeze of the favour of God, the Lord of mankind, bath wafted." 

 The members of the Universal House of


<p432>
432                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Justice, all being in Haifa at the time of the election, were able to visit the Holy Shrines of Baha'u'llah, the Bab, and of 'Abdu'l-Baha, where they prostrated themselves at the Sacred Thresholds and humbly sought strength and assistance in the mighty task before them. 

 Later, in London, they have paid homage at the resting-place of Shoghi Effendi, the blessed and sacred bough of the Tree of Holiness. 

 As soon as the House of Justice is able to organize its work and deploy its forces, it will examine carefully all the conditions of the Cause of God, and communications will be made to the friends. At this time we call upon the believers everywhere to follow up vigorously the opportunities opened up by the World Crusade. 

 Consolidation and deepening must go hand in hand with an eager extension of the teaching work so that the onward march of the Cause may continue unabated in preparation for future plans. Now that the attention of the public is becoming more and more drawn to the Cause of God, the friends must brace themselves and prepare their institutions to sustain the gaze of the world, whether it be friendly or hostile, eager or idle. 

 The Universal House of Justice greets you all lovingly and joyfully at this time, and asks you to pray fervently for its speedy development and the spiritual strengthening of its members.

4. THE WORLD CENTRE OF THE BAHA'I FAITH — 
ITS SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE IMPORTANCE

  Address by the Hand of the Cause PAUL HANEY on April30, 1963, at the World Congress IN many of his glorious messages to the Baha world the beloved Guardian described for us the twin spiritual and administrative World Centres existing and fixed permanently in the Holy Land, "constituting the midmost heart of the entire planet", the source of spiritual power and the object of adoration of all Baha'is. He also drew for us a clear and inspiring picture of those sacred and divinely-ordained institutions which comprise the heart and the nerve centre of our Faith in the twin holy cities of 'Akka and Haifa. 

 Our Guardian explained to us that there are three divinely revealed charters which have set in motion three distinct processes in the unfoldment  of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 1.     The Tablet of Carmel, revealed by Baha'u'llah Himself, which is the charter for the development of the institutions of the Faith at its World Centre, including the establishment of the supreme edifice of the Universal 

House of Justice.          
    2.     The Will and Testament

 of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the charter for the establishment of the Administrative Order throughout the world; and 3. The Tablets of the Divine Plan, constituting the charter for the propagation of the Faith and the spiritual conquest of the planet. 

 It was the Tablet of Carmel which generated the spiritual impulse for the rise and establishment  of the Baha'i international institutions in the lloiy Land, a process the beginnings of which, Shoghi Effendi told us, "may be traced as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic Age of the Faith", and which will attain its final consummation in the Golden Age, "through the raising of the standard of the Most Great Peace and the emergence in the plenitude of its power and glory of the focal centre of the agencies constituting the World 

Order of Baha'u'llah.      

 The final establishment of this seat of the future Baha World Commonwealth will," he told us, "signalize at once the proclamation of the sovereignty of the Founder of our Faith and the advent of the Kingdom of the Father..." 
                           
       PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE      
OF THE INSTITUTIONS        

 As long ago as 1939, at the time of the transfer of the sacred remains of the lloiy Mother and the Purest Branch to Mt. Carmel and their interment in the vicinity of the Tomb of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the beloved Guardian, in a stirring message to the American Baha'is, began to reveal the profound importance and administrative significance of the institutions which in the future would be established within the shadow of the Shrine of the BTh on God's Holy 

Mountain.                  

 In commenting on the reburial of these holy souls, he told us that: "The transfer of the sacred remains of the brother and mother of our Lord and Master 

'Abdu'l-Baha to Mt. Carmel

 and their final interment within the hallowed precincts of the Shrine of the flAb, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf, constitute,  apart from their historic associations and the tender sentiments they arouse, events of such capital institutional significance as oniy future happenings, steadily and mysteriously unfolding at the World Centre of our Faith, can adequately demonstrate." 

 In that same message lie referred to the Tablet of Carmel, quoting from its various passages, such as: "Haste thee, 0 Carmel, for Ic, the light of the countenance of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and Fashioner of the heavens, bath been lifted upon thee.". .'¶Reioice,for God bath made thee the dawning-place of His signs and the dayspring c/His Revelation." 

 He also stated that: "It must be clearly understood, nor can it be sufficiently emphasized, that the conjunction of the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother incalculably reinforces the spiritual


<p434>
434                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 potencies of that consecrated spot which, under the wings of the DAb's overshadowing Sepulchre,  and in the vicinity of the future Mashriqu'l-Adhkar,  which will be reared on its flank, is destined to evolve into the focal centre of those world-shaking, world-embracing, world-directing administrative institutions, ordained by Baha'u'llah and anticipated by 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 "To attempt to visualize, even in its barest outline, the glory that must envelop these institutions,  to essay even a tentative and partial description of their character or the manner of their operation, or to trace however inadequately the course of events leading to their rise and eventual establishment is far beyond my own capacity and power. 

 Suffice it to say that at this troubled stage in world history the association of these thee incomparablyprecious souls who, next to the three Central Figures of our Faith, tower in rank above the vast multitude of the heroes, letters, martyrs, hands, teachers and administrators of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, in such a potentially powerful spiritual and administrative Centre, is in itself an event which will release forces that are bound to hasten the emergence in a land which, geographically, spiritually and administratively, constitutes the heart of the entire planet, of some of the brightest gems of that World Order now shaping in the womb of this travailing age." 

 On July 7, 1950, in announcing to the Baha'i world the completion of the initial stage of the building of the superstructure of the Shine of the Bab, the beloved Guardian referred to "the process set in motion sixty years ago by Baha'u'llah's visit to Mt. Carmel", and after reviewing the contribution to its unfoldment made by the successive stages in the construction  of the Shrine, stated that this process would attain its consummation "through the emergence of the institutions of the World Administrative Centre of the Faith in the vicinity of its World Spiritual Centre, signalizing the sailing of the Divine Ark on God's Mountain, prophesied  in the Tablet of CarmeL" 

  THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL    
          COUNCIL                    

 On January 9, 1951, the beloved Guardian announced the formation of the first 

International  Baha'i Council

 and characterized it as the "forerunner of supreme administrative institution destined to emerge in fullness of time within precincts and beneath the shadow of World Spiritual Centre of the Faith already established in the twin cities of 'Akka and Haifa." 

 During the Ri4vAn period of the same year (1951), Shoghi Effendi, in opening the door to direct contributions to the International Fund in the Holy Land by individual believers throughout the world, as well as by National and Local Assemblies, referred to "the establishment of the International Baha'i Council and the construction of the superstructure of the DAb's Sepulchre" as constituting "the initial major evidences" of "the rise and consolidation of the Administrative Centre of the World Faith of Baha'u'llah." In that same message he told the believers that upon their response to the needs which he described would "depend the nature and rapidity of the evolution of the World Administrative Centre designed to culminate in the erection of the last unit crowning the structure of the embryonic World Order of Baha'u'llah", this of course being a reference to the establishment of the Universal House of Justice. 

 More than three years later, after completion of the superstructure of the Shrine of the Bab, the Guardian, in announcing the acquisition of a thirteen hundred metre plot located in "a central position amidst the extensive Baha domains in the heart of God's Holy Mountain", indicated that the ownership of this plot would permit the location of the site, the excavation of the foundations and the erection of the structure of the International Baha Archives, constituting one of the foremost objectives of the Ten Year Plan. 

 In this historic message he also disclosed that the raising of the edifice of an International Archives would "in turn herald the construction,  in the course of successive epochs of the Formative Age of the Faith, of several other structures" designed to serve as the administrative seat of the various divinely-appointed institutions  of the Faith, including the Universal House of Justice. These edifices, he explained, will be in the shape of a far-flung arc surrounding  the resting-places of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Purest Branch and the Holy Mother. "The ultimate completion of this stupendous undertaking,"  he told us, "will mark the culmination


<p435>
THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE    435

  of the development of a worldwide divinely appointed 

Administrative Order."     
                           
PROGRESS REFLECTED IN      
THE                        
   GUARDIAN'S MESSAGES        

 In each of his last three annual RiQvAn Messages our beloved Guardian shared with the friends throughout the world additional news reflecting the rapid progress of construction  of the International Archives Building and the expansion of the ownership of properties on Mt. Carmel, safeguarding the future development of the Baha'i spiritual and administrative  institutions. 

 In April 1955 announcement was made of steps "being taken for the purchase of several properties.. 

 the acquisition of which is essential  for the safeguarding of the area in the close vicinity of the BTh's Sepulchre, as well as for the future expansion of the arc around which the edifices destined to serve as the seat of the future 

Baha'i World Commonwealth 
are to be erected."        
    A year later, in his RiKivAn

Message for 1956, Shoghi   

 Effendi informed the BaWd world that: "In the Hoiy Land, the centre and pivot round which the divinely appointed, fast multiplying institutions of a world-encircling, resistlessly marching Faith revolve, the double process, so noticeable in recent years, involving a rapid decline in the fortunes of the breakers of Baha'u'llah's  Covenant and proclaiming the rise of the institutions of its World Administrative Centre, in the shadow of His Shrine, has been accelerated on the one hand, through the death, in miserable circumstances, of the treacherous and malignant Majdi'd-Din, the last survivor of the principal instigators of the rebellion against the Will of the Founder of our Faith, and on the other, through the laying of the foundation, and the erection of some of the pillars, of the fagade and of the northern side of the International Baha'i Archives — the first of the major edifices destined to constitute the seat of the World 

Baha Administrative       

 Centre to be established on Mt. Carmel." 
   And finally, in his last   

RiQvAn Message in April    

 1957, the beloved Guardian was able to share with the friends the following joyful announcement: "In the Holy Land, the Qiblib of a world community, the heart from which the energizing influences of a vivifying Faith continually tinually stream, and the seat and centre around which the diversified activities of a divinely appointed 

Administrative Order       

 revolve — following  upon the termination of the construction  of the Rib's Holy Sepulchre, marking the closing of the first chapter in the history of the evolution of the central institutions of a world Faith, a marked progress in the rise and establishment  of these institutions has been clearly noticeable. 

 The remaining twenty-two pillars of the International Baha'i Archives — the initial edifice heralding the establishment of the Baha'i 

World Administrative       

 Centre on Mt. Carmel — have been erected. The last half of the nine hundred tons of stone, ordered in Italy for its construction, have reached their destination, enabling the exterior of the building to be completed,  while the forty-four tons of glazed green tiles, manufactured in Utrecht, to cover the five hundred square metres of roof, have been placed in position, the whole contributing to an unprecedented degree through its colourfulness, its classic style and graceful proportions, and in conjunction with the stately golden-crowned Mausoleum rising beyond it, to the unfolding glory of the central institutions of a World Faith, nestling in the heart of God's 

Holy Mountain.             

 "Simultaneous with this striking development, the plan designed to insure the extension and completion of the arc serving as a base for the erection of future edifices constituting the World 

Baha Administrative       

 Centre, has been successfully carried out." 
                           
LAST UNIT OF THE EMBRYONIC 
       WORLD ORDER                

 And now, in this RiQv~n period, at the termination of the World Crusade of our beloved Guardian, coinciding with the end of the first epoch of the unfoldment of the Divine Plan of 'Abdu'l-Baha, that "last unit crowning the structure of the embryonic World Order of Baha'u'llah", the Universal House of Justice, has been established. 

 The election of this glorious institution which Shoghi Efi'endi said would be regarded by posterity as "the last refuge of a tottering civilization", brings to fruition at long last the ardent hopes of the Master and the Guardian, both of whom confidently anticipated the time when this august institution would come into


<p436>
436                THE BAHA I WORLD

 being and fulfil its divinely-ordained function as "the Supreme Legislative Body of the 

Administrative  Order    
of the Faith of Baha'u'llah." 

 The first foundations of this sacred edifice were reared in the days of the Master, Who devoted so much of His time and effort to raising up and training the Local Spiritual Assemblies and committees in the countries where groups of Baha existed. 

 Then the beloved Guardian, acting under the infallible guidance and supreme authority conferred  upon him in the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, steadily expanded these foundations as he strove to educate and deepen the believers in their knowledge of the administration  and its true purpose. 

 At length this process of preparation reached the point where our Guardian could assign definite plans with specific objectives to the various national communities, and, finally, a World Crusade for the spiritual conquest of the entire planet, making possible the erection of no less than fifty-six 

National and Regional Assemblies

 which now constitute the pillars of the supreme edifice of the Universal 

House of Justice.         

 The importance of this process and its glorious consummation were described by Shoghi Effendi in various communications, some written as early as 1923. ma letter written in December of that year he said: "As to the order and management of the spiritual affairs of the friends, that which is very important now is the consolidation of the Spiritual Assemblies in every centre, because on these fortified and unshakable foundations, God's 

Supreme House of Justice  

 shall be erected and firmly established in the days to come. When this most great edifice shall be reared on such an immovable foundation, God's purpose, wisdom, universal truths, mysteries and realities of the Kingdom, which the mystic 

Revelation of Baha'u'llah  
has deposited  within    

The Will and Testament    

 of 'Abdu'l-Baha, shall gradually be revealed and made manifest." 

 And less than a year later, in October 1924, he told us that: 

     "These Spiritual Assemblies

 have been primarily constituted to carry out these affairs, and secondly to lay a perfect and strong foundation for the establishment of the divine and 

Universal House of Justice.

 When that central pivot of the people of RaM shall be effectively, majestically and firmly established, a new era will dawn, heavenly bounties and graces will pour out from that Source, and the all-encom-passing promises will be fulfilled." 
                          
          IMPORTANCE  OF THE BELIEVERS' TASKS

 Then in a communication written a number of years preceding the inception of the Ten Year Plan, he gave us another glimpse of the supreme future importance of the tasks which the believers were being called upon to perform: "The purpose of so much perpetual and intensive emphasis on the support and consolidation  of these Spiritual Assemblies is this.., that the foundation of the Cause of God must become  broader and stronger day by day, that no confusion ever enter the divine order, that new and strong ties be forged between East and West, that Baha'i unity be safeguarded and illumine the eyes of the people of the world with its resplendent beauty, so that upon these assemblies God's Houses of Justice may be firmly established and upon these secondary Houses of Justice the lofty edifice of the Universal House of Justice may, with complete order, perfection and glory, and with no delay, be raised up. When the Universal House of Justice shall have stepped forth from the realm of hope into that of visible fulfilment and its fame be established in every corner and clime of the world, then that august body, solidly grounded and founded on the firm and unshakable  foundation of the entire Baha'i community of East and West, and the recipient of the bounties of God and His inspiration... will proceed to devise and carry out important undertakings, worldwide activities and the establishment of glorious institutions. 

 By this means the renown of the Cause of God will become worldwide and its light will illumine the whole earth." 

 In one of his messages written in the period between the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the World Crusade, the beloved  Guardian promised us that thb long process  of building the foundations of the 

Administrative  Order    

 would eventually bring us to the time — "During this Formative Age of the Faith".. when the "last and crowning stage in


<p437>

PROMISES, INJUNCTIONS      
FROM THE WILL AND TESTAMENT
                           
  Although every Baha'i     

 is familiar with the spiritual authority conferred upon the Universal  House of 

Justice by Baha'u'llah    

 and the Centre of His Covenant, it is appropriate at this historic moment to review some of the passages from the sacred Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha which set forth the divine promises  and injunctions relating to this august institution. 

  "And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath orda med as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members must be manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings of knowledge and understanding,  must be steadfast in God's faith and the well-wishers of all mankind. By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, that is, in all countries a secondary House of Justice must be instituted, and these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the Universal one. 

 Unto this body all things must be referred.  It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text." 

 "The sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause of God as well as tije Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected and estabIished~ are both under the care and pro tec-tion  of the AbIuI Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyetli him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God, wlioso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God, whoso opposeth him hath opposed God, wI~oso contendeth with them hath contended with God.. 

 "This is the foundation of the belief of the people of Baha (may my life be offered up for them). 

'His Holiness, the Exalted 

 One, (the BcTh) is the Manifestation of die Unity and Oneness of God and the Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty. 

His Holiness the Abhd      

 Beauty (may my life be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence. 

 All others are servants unto Him and do His bidding.' 

Unto the Most Holy Book    

 every one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein nwst be referred to the Universal 

House of Justice. That     

 which this body, whether unanimously or by a malority doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant." 

 "All must seek guidance and turn unto the Centre of the Cause and the 

House of Justice. And      

 he that turneth unto whatsoever else is indeed in grievous error. 

    "The Glory of Glories      
rest upon you!"            

  In many of his writings during the thirty-six year period of his ministry, the beloved Guardian explained the functions of the House of Justice and described the bounties which would descend upon the world following its establishment. 

 He made it clear that Baha'u'llah's  promise that "God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willetli" referred to the institution of the House of Justice acting as the consultative body having the "exclusive right and prerogative to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws and ordinances as Baha'u'llah has not expressly revealed." 

 In a message sent early in 1951 commenting on the participation of four National Spiritual Assemblies in the newly opened African teaching  campaign which was to bring such joy to his heart, Shoghi Effendi gave an indication of the future role of the Universal House of Justice in linking the various National Assemblies  in worldwide undertakings. 

  "Fervently praying participation

438                THE BAHA'I WORLD
       THE BLESSING CONFERRED    
UPON THE WORLD            

 In closing let us attempt to understand, through these majestic words of our beloved Guardian, the extent of the blessing now conferred  upon the entire world through the establishment ofBah&u'lIAh's 

Universal House of Justice.

 Referring to the first charter mentioned earlier, Shoghi Effendi, in one of his messages explained that: "In this great Tablet (of Carmel) which unveils divine mysteries and heralds the establishment of two mighty, majestic and momentous undert~ings... 

 the Spiritual and Administrative World Centres of the Faith. Baha'u'llah refers to an 'Ark', whose dwellers are the men of the Supreme House of Justice, which in conformity with the exact provisions of the Will and Testament of the Centre of the Mighty Covenant is the body which should legislate on laws not explicitly revealed in the Text. In this dispensation, these laws are destined to flow from this Holy Mountain, even as in the Mosaic Dispensation, the law of God was promulgated from Zion. The 'sailing of the Ark' of His laws is a reference to the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, which is indeed the House of Legislature, one of the branches of the World 

Administrative Centre     
of the Baha'is on this    

Holy Mountain.~~          

 And in other messages referring to the time when this supreme institution would be established, he told us that: "Through it the pillars of the Faith on this earth will be firmly established and its hidden powers be revealed, its signs shine forth, its banners be unfurled and its light be shed upon all peoples." 

 "Then will all our cherished hopes and aspirations be realized, the tree of our endeavours bear fruit, the Will and Testament  of our Master and our Beloved be fully and firmly established, and the hidden powers of the Cause of our Lord and God be fully manifested. 

 Then will be unveiled before our eyes the inauguration of an era the like of which has never been witnessed in past ages." 

 •   "Then will the throne of Baha'u'llah's sovereignty be founded in the promised land and the scales of justice be raised on high. Then will the banner of the independence of the Faith be unfurled, and His Most Great Law be unveiled and rivers of laws and ordinances stream forth from this snow-white spot with all-conquering power and awe-inspiring majesty, the like of which past ages have never seen. 

 Then will appear the truth of what was revealed by the Tongue of Grandeur: 'Call out to Zion, 0 Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was hidden from mortal eyes is corneliUs all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing splendour is revealed. 

 o     Carmel well is it with him that circlet/i around thee, that proclaimeth the revelation of thy glory, and recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord, thy God, liath showered upon thee. 

 Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of RaM, who have been mentioned in the Book of Names'"

THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE    439

  ~. THE AUTHORITY, POWERS AND FUNCTIONS 

    OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

  THE Guardian stated in his World Order letters' that "we stand.., too close to so monumental a document to claim for oprselves a complete understanding of all its implications, or to presume to have grasped the manifold mysteries it undoubtedly contains. 

 Only future generations can comprehend the value and the significance attached to this Divine Masterpiece, which the hand of the Master-builder of the world has designed for the unification and the triumph of the worldwide 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.     

 Only those who come after us will be in a position to realize the value of the surprisingly strong emphasis that has been placed on the institution of the House of Justice and of the Guardianship." 

 One of the ways in which the friends will come to a fuller understanding of the authority, powers and functions of the 

Universal House of Justice

 will be through elucidations and statements made from time to time by that supreme body itself. Twice during the first five years of its existence the Universal House of Justice was called upon to make major statements in response to questions asked — once by a National Spiritual Assembly and at another time by an individual believer. 

 The elucidations provided by the Universal House of Justice in response to those questions are reprinted here. 
                          
Exce~pts from a Letter to a National Spiritual Assemb4y2
March 9, 1965              

 We are glad that you have brought to our attention the questions perplexing some of the believers. 

 It is much better for these questions to be put freely and openly than to have them, unexpressed, burdening the hearts of devoted believers. 

 Once one grasps certain basic princi-pies  of the 

Revelation of Baha'u'llah  

 such uncertainties  are easily dispelled. This is not to say that the Cause of God contains no mysteries. Mysteries there are indeed, but they are not of a kind to shake one's faith once the essential tenets of the Cause and the indisputable facts of any situation are clearly understood. 

 The questions put by the various believers fall into three groups. The first group centres upon the following queries: Why were steps taken to elect a Universal House of Justice with the foreknowledge that there would be no Guardian? 

 Was the time ripe for such an action?  Could not the International Baha'i Council have carried on the work? 

 At the time of our beloved Shoghi Effendi's death it was evident, from the circumstances and from the explicit requirements of the lloiy Texts, that it had been impossible for him to appoint a successor in accordance with the 1 The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p.s. Wellspring of Guidance, pp. 44 — 56. 

 provisions of the Will and Testament of'Abdu'1-BahA. 

 This situation, in which the Guardian died without being able to appoint a successor, presented an obscure question not covered by the explicit Holy Text, and had to be referred to the Universal 

House of Justice. The      

 friends should clearly understand that before the election of the Universal House of Justice there was no knowledge that there would be no Guardian. 

 There could not have been any such foreknowledge, whatever opinions individual believers may have held. Neither the Hands of the Cause of God, nor the International Baha Council, nor any other existing body could make a decision upon this all-important matter. 

 Only the House of Justice had authority to pronounce upon it. This was one urgent reason for calling the election of the Universal House of Justice as soon as possible. 

 Following the passing of Shoghi Effendi the international administration of the Faith was carried on by the Hands of the Cause of God with the complete agreement and loyalty of the National Spiritual Assemblies and the body of the believers. This was in accordance with the Guardian's designation of the Hands as the "Chief 

Stewards of Baha'u'llah's  
embryonic World Commonwealth."

BE


<p440>
440                 THE BARk'! WORLD

 From the very outset of their custodianship of the Cause of God the Hands realized that since they had no certainty of Divine guidance such as is incontrovertibly assured to the Guardian and to the Universal House of Justice, their one safe course was to follow with undeviating firmness the instructions and policies of Shoghi Effendi. The entire history of religion shows no comparable record of such strict self-discipline, such absolute loyalty, and such complete self-abnegation by the leaders of a religion finding themselves suddenly deprived of their divinely inspired guide. The debt of gratitude which mankind for generations, nay, ages to come, owes to this handful of grief-stricken, steadfast, heroic souls is beyond estimation. 

 The Guardian had given the Baha'i world explicit and detailed plans covering the period until Rktv~n 1963, the end of the 

Ten Year Crusade. From     

 that point onward, unless the Faith were to be endangered, further Divine guidance was essential. This was the second pressing reason for the calling of the election of the Universal 

House of Justice. The      

 rightness of the time was further confirmed by references in Shoghi Effendi's letters to the Ten Year Crusade's being followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice. One such reference is the following passage from a letter addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles on February 25, 1951, concerning its Two Year Plan which immediately preceded the Ten Year 

Crusade:                   

 "On the success of this enterprise, unprecedented in its scope, unique in its character, and immense in its spiritual potentialities, must depend the initiation, at a later period in the Formative Age of the Faith, of undertakings embracing within their range all National Assemblies functioning throughout the Baha world, undertakings constituting in themselves a prelude to the launching of worldwide enterprises  destined to be embarked upon, in future epochs of that same age, by the Universal House of Justice, that will symbolize the unity and coordinate and unify the activities of these National 

Assemblies."               

 Having been in charge of the Cause of God for six years, the Hands, with absolute faith in the Holy Writings, called upon the believers to elect the Universal House of Justice, and even went so far as to ask that they themselves be not voted for. The sole, sad instance of anyone succumbing to the allurements of power was the pitiful attempt of Charles Mason Remey to usurp the Guardianship... 

  "At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint their delegates, and these in turn elect their representadves, and these representatives elect a body, that body shall be re-gardedas  the 

Supreme House of Justice.  

 "The establishment of that House is not dependent upon the conversion of all the nations of the world. For example, if conditions were favourable and no disturbances would be caused~ the friends in Persia would elect their representatives, and likewise the friends in America, in India, and other areas would also elect their representatives, and these would elect a House of Justice. That House of Justice would be the Supreme House of Justice. That isa?!." 

(Persian and Arabic Tablets

 of 'Abdu'l-Baha, vol. m, pp. 499 — 501.) 

  The friends should realize that there is nothing in the Texts to indicate that the election of the 

Universal House of Justice 

 could be called oniy by the Guardian. On the contrary, 'Abdu'l-Baha envisaged the calling of its election in His own lifetime. At a time described by the Guardian as "the darkest moments of His (the Master's) life, under 'Abdu'1-Ijamid's regime, when He stood to be deported to the most inhospitable regions of Northern Africa", and when even His life was threatened, 'Abdu'l-Baha wrote to Ij6ji Mirza Taqf Afn~n, the cousin of the DAb and chief builder of the 'Ishqabad Temple, commanding him to arrange  for the election of the Universal House of Justice should the threats against the Master materialize. 

 The second part of the Master's Will is also relevant to such a situation and should be studied by the friends. 

 The second series of problems vexing some of the friends centres on the question of the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice and its ability to function without the presence of the Guardian... 

 It should be understood by the friends that before legislating upon any matter the Universal House of Justice studies carefully and exhaustively both the Sacred Texts and the writings  of Shoghi Effendi on the subject. 

 The interpretations written by the beloved Guardian


<p441>
THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE    441

 cover a vast range of subjects and are equally as binding as the Text itself. 

 There is a profound difference between the interpretations of the Guardian and the elucidations  of the House of Justice in exercise of its function to "deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure, and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book." The Guardian reveals what the Scripture means; his interpretation is a statement of truth which cannot be varied. Upon the Universal House of Justice, in the words of the Guardian, "has been conferred the exclusive right of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the Baha'i Writings." Its pronouncements, which are susceptible of amendment or abrogation by the House of Justice itself, serve to supplement and apply the Law of God. 

 Although not invested with the function of interpretation, the House of Justice is in a position to do everything necessary  to establish the World Order of Baha'u'llah on this earth. Unity of doctrine is maintained by the existence of the authentic texts of Scripture and the voluminous interpretations of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, together with the absolute prohibition against anyone propounding "authoritative" or "inspired" interpretations or usurping the function of Guardian. Unity of administration is assured by the authority of the 

Universal House of Justice.

 "Such," in the words of Shoghi Effendi, "is the immutability of His revealed Word. Such is the elasticity which characterizes the functions of His appointed ministers. The first preserves the identity of His Faith, and guards the integrity  of His law. The second enables it, even as a living organism, to expand and adapt itself to the needs and requirements of an everchanging  society." 

 The third group of queries raised by the friends concerns details of functioning of the Universal House of Justice in the absence of the Guardian, particularly the matter of expulsion of members of the House of Justice. Such questions will be clarified in the Constitution of the House of Justice, the formulation of which is a goal of the Nine Year Plan. Meanwhile  the friends are informed that any member committing a "sin injurious to the common weal" may be expelled from membership of the House of Justice by a majority vote of the House itself. Should any member, God forbid, be guilty of breaking the Covenant, the matter would be investigated by the Hands of the Cause of God, and the Covenant-breaker would be expelled by decision of the Hands of the Cause of God residing in the Holy Land, subject to the approval of the House of Justice, as in the case of any other believer. 

 The decision of the Hands in such a case would be announced to the Baha world by the Universal 

House of Justice.          

  Excerpts from a Letter to an Individual Believer' 

May 27, 1966

 •You query the timing of the election of the Universal House of Justice in view of the Guardian's statement: given favourable circumstances under which the Baha'is of Persia and the adjoining countries under Soviet rule may be enabled to elect their national representatives. 

 the oniy remaining obstacle in the way of the definite formation of the International House of Justice will have been removed." On April 19, 1947, the Guardian, in a letter written on his behalf by his secretary, replied to the inquiry of an individual believer about this passage: "At the time he referred to Russia there were Baha'is there. 

 Now the community has practically ceased to exist; therefore the formation of the Wellspring of Guidance, pp.81 — 91. 

 International House of Justice cannot depend on a Russian National Spiritual Assembly, but other strong 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 will have to be built up before it can be established." 

 You suggest the possibility that, for the good of the Cause, certain information concerning the succession to Shoghi Efi'endi is being withheld  from the believers. We assure you that nothing whatsoever is being withheld from the friends for whatever reason. There is no doubt at all that in the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi was the authority designated to appoint his successor; but he had no children and all the surviving Agli~6n had broken the Covenant. Thus, as the Hands of the Cause stated in 1957, it is clear that there was no one he could have appointed in accor

  dance with the provisions of the Will. To have made an appointment outside the clear and specific provisions of the Master's Will and Testament would obviously have been an impossible  and unthinkable course of action for the Guardian, the divinely appointed upholder and defender of the Covenant. 

 Moreover, that same Will had provided a clear means for the confirmation of the Guardian's appointment of his successor, as you are aware. The nine Hands to be elected by the body of the Hands were to give their assent by secret ballot to the Guardian's choice. In 1957 the entire body of the Hands, after fully investigating the matter, announced that Shoghi Effendi had appointed no successor and left no will. This is documented and established. 

 The fact that Shoghi Effendi did not leave a wilicannot be adduced as evidence of his failure to obey Baha'u'llah — rather should we acknowledge  that in his very silence there is a wisdom and a sign of his infallible guidance. We should ponder deeply the Writings that we have, and seek to understand the multitudinous significances that they contain. Do not forget that Shoghi Effendi said two things were necessary for a growing understanding of the World 

Order of Baha'u'llah:     

 the passage of time and the guidance of the Universal 

House of Justice.         

 The infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, operating within its ordained sphere, has not been made dependent upon the presence  in its membership of the Guardian of the Cause. 

 Although in the realm of interpretation the Guardian's pronouncements are always binding, in the area of the Guardian's participation  in legislation it is always the decision of the House itself which must prevail. This is supported  by the words of the Guardian: "The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgement on such laws and ordinan


<p443>

 '~Thougli the Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head of so august a body he can never, even temporarily, assume the right of exclusive legislation. He cannot override  the decision of the majority of his fellow members, but is bound to insist upon a reconsideration  by them of any enactment he conscientiously believes to conflict with the meaning and to depart from the spirit of Baha'u'llah's revealed utterances." 

 ...     As you point out with many quotations, Shoghi Effendi repeatedly stressed the inseparability  of these two institutions. 

 Whereas he obviously envisaged their functioning together, it cannot logically be deduced from this that one is unable to function in the absence of the other. During the whole thirty-six years of his 

Guardianship Shoghi Effendi
functioned without the     

Universal House of Justice.
Now the Universal House    

 of Justice must function without the Guardian, but the principle of inseparability remains. The Guardianship does not lose its significance nor position in the Order of Baha'u'llah merely because there is no living Guardian. We must guard against two extremes: one is to argue that because there is no Guardian all that was written about the Guardianship and its position in the Baha'i World Order is a dead letter and was unim portant; the other is to be so overwhelmed by the significance of the Guardianship as to underestimate the strength of the Covenant, or to be tempted to compromise with the clear Texts in order to IThd somehow, in some way, a "Guardian 

 As   As the Universal House

 of Justice has already announced, it cannot legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi Effendi, nor can it legislate to make possible the appointment of any more Hands of the Cause, but it must do everything within its power to ensure the performance of all those functions which it shares with these two mighty institutions. 

 It must make provision for the proper discharge in future of the functions of protection and propagation, which the administrative bodies share with the Guardianship  and the Hands of the Cause; it must, in the absence of the Guardian, receive and disburse the }juqflqu'11Th, in accordance with the following statement of 'Abdu'l-Baha: "Dis-position  of the Ijuqaq, wholly or partly, is permissible,  but this should be done by permission of the authority in the Cause to whom all must turn." 

 It must make provision in its Constitution  for the removal of any of its members who commits a sin "injurious to the common weal". Above all, it must, with perfect faith in Baha'u'llah, proclaim His Cause and enforce Ills law so that the Most Great Peace shall be firmly established in this world and the foundation  of the Kingdom of God on earth shall be accomplished.

HANDS OF THE CAUSE            459

  i. THE INSTITUTION OF THE HANDS OF 

                  THE CAUSE OF GOD

Adaptedfrom Baha'i Journal of the British Isles, November 1965

  DURING the last years of Baha'u'llah's ministry the work of the Cause expanded greatly, centres were multiplying, and correspondence  greatly increased. It was during this period that Professor E. G. Browne of Cambridge was granted his four successive interviews with Baha'u'llah during the five days he was His guest (April 15 — 20, 1890).' 

 In that same year Baha'u'llah's tent, the "Tabernacle of Glory", was raised on Mt. Carmel and it was during this period that a few of His followers were appointed as "Hands of the Cause of God", one of the "preliminary steps aiming at the disclosure of the scope and working of this Administrative 

Order" ~2                 

 In the Tablet of Ta]alIiy~t Baha'u'llah addresses one of those whom He appointed as a Hand of the Cause: 

  "0 'Au Qabl-i-Akbar! We   

 have heard thy voice repeatedly, and We have responded to thee in that which the sayings of the world cannot  equal, and from which the sincere ones find the perfume of the utterance of the clement One, the lovers the fragrances of union, and the thirsty one the murmur of the kawlizar of life. Blessed is lie who attains thereto and discovers thatsweet fragrance which isnowbeingdiffused from the Pen of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Bestower! 
.                         
And further in that same  

Tablet:                   

  "Blessed is thy face, for it turned unto Our direction; tlzine ears, for they heard, and thy tongue, for it uttered the praise of God, the Lord of Lords! 

 We beg of God to make thee a banner for assistance of His Cause, and to draw thee nearer unto Him under all circumstances. 

 We make mention of the friends of God and His beloved ones in that place, and We gladden them through that which is revealed  unto them from the kingdom of the utterance of their Lord, the King of the Day of Judgeinent. 

 Remember them on My part, and illumine them with the lights of/he orb of My utterance. Verily tliyLord is the Mighty, the Gracious."~ Surely we may read in these words a confirmation of Baha'u'llah's love and trust, and a lovinginstructionto one who had been appointed by Him to the station of service, a Hand of the 

Cause of God.             

 Baha'u'llah exhorts the Hands of the Cause to "illumine them (the friends) with the lights of the orb of My utterance" and 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Willand Testament lays down very clearly their obligations. It is of interest to note that within the first few hundred words of His Will and 

Testament 'Abdu'l-Baha    
refers to the             

Hands:                    

  "Salutation and praise, blessing and glory rest... 

 upon the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of Gad that have Diffused widely the Divine 

Fragrances Declared His   
Proofs                    
Proclaimed His Faith      
Published abroad His Law  

 Detached themselves from all things but Him Stood for righteousness in this world And kindled the Fire of the Love of God in the very hearts and souls of His servants; In this beautiful passage Abdu'l-Baha expresses to the Hands Hisjoy and praise for their work. 

 Then further on in that same Will and Testament He reiterates in clear language their obligations: "The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the character of all men, and to be, at all times and under all conditions, sanctified and detached from earthly things. 

 They must manifest the fear of God by their conduct, their manners, their deeds and their words."~ Although 'Abdu'l-Baha did not appoint Hands of the Cause in His lifetime, He referred in writing to a few believers as 

"Hands". He

  The Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Rdhiyyih Kizdnum and Mrs. Violette Naklzfavdni with the Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, May 26th, 1967, in New Delhi. 

  indicated in His Will and Testament that the Guardian of the Cause of God would make such appointments: "0 friends! The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed by the Guardian of the Cause of God. All must be under his shadow and obey his command. Should any, within or without the company of the Hands of the Cause of God disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance will be upon him, for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of God."~ The Guardian appointed the first twelve living Hands in December, 1951, "equally allocated Holy Land, Asiatic, American, European continents. 

 It is important to realise that this long-defer-red step was taken in conjunction with six steps that were "greatly accelerated through series of swiftly succeeding events originated in World Centre of Faith." 

 These six steps (given in detail in Messages to the Baha'i World, pp. 19 — 20) were momentous; in the words of the Guardian: "Opening years of the second epoch of the Formative Age now witnessing at long last commencement of third vast majestic fate-laden  process following two above-men-tioned  developments destined though gradual emergence of the manifold institutions in World Centre of the Faith as crown of the administrative structure of Baha'u'llah's embryonic 

World Order."8             

  Again it is important to realise that the first "four Conferences embracing eleven National Assembli&s in all continents of globe" were attended by Hands of the Cause of God as representatives of the Guardian. You can now see how clearly the Guardian foresaw these unfolding  events when you read in God Passes By, written in 1944, the words quoted at the beginning of this article: one of the "prelimi-nary  steps aiming at the disclosure of the scope and working of this Administrative Order... 

        Then in February 1952 a    

 further seven Hands were appointed, raising the number to nineteen, and in this message the Guardian mentions specifically twofold sacred functions:

 "Members august body invested in conformity  with 'Abdu'l-Baha's Testament, twofold sacred function, the propagation and preservation of the unity of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and destined to assume individually  in the course of time the direction of institutions paralleling those revolving around the Universal House of 

Justice.                   

  In December 195310 a further appointment was made to the ranks of the Hands of the Cause and it was in May of that same year that the Guardian sent a message to the Wilmette Intercontinental 

Conference:                

  ..... Let there be no mistake. The avowed, the primary aim of this Spiritual Crusade is none other than the conquest of the citadels of men's hearts. The theatre of its operations is the entire planet. Its duration a whole decade... Its Marshal is none other than the Author of the Divine Plan. Its standard-bearers are the Hands of the Cause of God appointed in every continent of the globe. Its generals are the twelve National Spiritual Assemblies participating in the execution of its design. 

  In March 1954 a further appointment to the ranks of the Hands of the Cause was announced and finally, the Guardian in his last message to the Baha'i world, of October, 1957, appointed a further eight Hands of the Cause, thus raising their number to twenty-seven. It was in this same message that the designation "Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth" was given them, thus investing them with the authority they were, unbeknown, to need. In the words of the Guardian "...who have been invested by the unerring Pen of the Centre of His Covenant with the dual function of guarding over the security, and of ensuring the propagation, of His Father's 

Faith."12                  
                           
       From 1951 the Guardian     

 was creating this truly wonderfulinstitution, carefully and slowly disclosing its functions, advising, guiding, not only the Hands, but the Baha'i world so that, when the time came, we should understand their purpose and thus together face any problems  that might come. 

 It was during March 1954 that the Guardian sent to all the Hands of the 

Cause and National Spiritual

 Assemblies of the world a message in which the Auxiliary Boards were mentioned for the first time: "Greatly value their (Hands) support in The Hand of the Cause Agnes Alexander (centre front) with the friends attending the seventh National Convention of the Baha'is of North East Asia, Tokyo, Japan; May, 1963.

Teaching Conferences;      

 in their extensive travels in African territories, in North, Central and South America, in the European, 

Asiatic and Australian     
continents.                

 "This newly constituted body, embarked on its mission with such auspicious circumstances,  is now entering the second phase of its evolution signalized by forging of ties with the 

National Spiritual Assemblies

 of the Baha'i world for the purpose of lending them assistance in attaining the objectives of the Ten 

Year Plan.""               

  Then follows the request to appoint Auxiliary Board members with other details concerning cerning arrangements. 

 We need oniy note here the breadth and scope of the work of our Hands of the Cause and realise that from November 1957 to April 1963 these same Hands, so assiduously trained by the Guardian, were, with words of loving comfort, guidance, and support,  indeed the Chief Stewards of Baha'u'llah's embryonic world commonwealth. Oniy time will disclose the immensity of the burden they bore. But we can see quite plainly how the law of consultation worked the miracle of welding their hearts into one heart, their wisdom pooled to guide the Baha world to victory. In the words of the Universal House of Justice in its 1963 Convention message: "The Universal House of Justice wishes to reaffirm at this time the tribute which it felt moved to pay to the Hands of the Cause of God at the World Congress, those precious souls who have brought the Cause safely to victory in the name of Shoghi 

Effendi                

  In its message of April 1964 announcing to


<p464>
464                THE BAHA'I WORLD
the Baha'i world the world-embracing

Nine Year Plan, the Universal

 House of Justice refers to the Hands as the "standard bearers of the Nine Year 

Plan":                     

  "The standard bearers of the Nine Year Plan are those same divinely appointed, tried, and victorious souls who bore the standard of the World Crusade, the Hands of the Cause of God, whose advice and consultation have been invaluable in the working out of this Nine Year Plan. 

 Supported by their 'deputies, assistants, and advisers', the members of the Auxiliary Boards, they will inspire and protect the army of God, lead through every breach to the limit of available  resources, and sustain those communities struggling over intractable or stony ground, so that by 1973 the celebrations befitting the centenary of the revelation of the Most lloiy Book may be undertaken by a victorious, firmly established, organically united world community, dedicated to the service of God and the final triumph of His Cause."'5 From the foiegoing passages we can, perhaps,  understand just a little the vital role played by the institution of the Hands of the Cause, an institution initiated by Baha'u'llah Himself, whose members have collectively and singly, by their example, shown the world how the love of Baha'u'llah leads to the knowledge of God and the love of our fellowmen. They have by their example shown the Baha'i world true consultation in action, and we have witnessed  the victories that flow therefrom; have opened our eyes to the meaning of dedicated service to the Cause of God, and by their sacrifice of personal considerations have helped us to a greater understanding of the meaning of detachment. 

 It was the Hands of the Cause who from 1957 kept the light of the Guardianship guiding the Cause; it was they who deviated not an inch from his instructions, and by this act of wisdom, devotion and faith kept the light of God's infant Faith burning in our hearts with ever-increasing intensity until the time when God's divinely ordained institution, the Universal House of Justice, assumed the guidance of the Baha'i world, a guidance therefore which has been continuous and uninterrupted for over one hundred years and will continue throughout the Baha'i dispensation.

       2. THE WORK AND TRAVELS OF THE HANDS OF
                  THE CAUSE OF GOD

  F OR nearly five-and-a-half years following the tragic loss of the beloved Guardian, the Hands of the Cause of God, acting in their assigned role as Custodians of the Baha'i Faith, had effectively managed the affairs of the Cause, bringing into being in 1961 the first elected 

International Baha'i       

 Council, guiding the Baha'is of the world toward the achievement  of a triumphant conclusion of the Guardian's Ten Year Crusade, calling for the election of the first Universal House of Justice, and providing for the celebration of the Most Great Jubilee in London at Ri~lv&n, 1963. 

 Their sterling efforts during that awesome and critical period in the history of the Faith moved the Universal House of Justice to pay special tribute to the Hands of the Cause in its first message, on the occasion of the World Congress.1 

 With the election of the Universal House of Justice they could lay down the heavy administrative burdens which had been thrust upon them in November, 1957, and concentrate their energies on their specialized duties of protection and propagation. 

 It was decided that the five Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land would be Abdu'l-Baha 

Rabiyyih Kh~num, Leroy     
C. loas, 'All Akbar Furcdan,

Paul Haney and Abii'1-Qdsim
Faizi. The other Hands     

 of the Cause were assigned to the five continents, carrying out their functions personally and through their Auxiliary 

Boards.                    

 Designated by the Universal House of Justice as "The Standard Bearers of the 

Nine Year Plan" the Hands  

 of the Cause ranged far and wide throughout the Baha world raising the call of service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, inspiring the believers and directing their labours toward the attainment of the prodigious goals assigned to the various National Baha communities. 

 Most of the Hands of the Cause built up very impressive records of travel. Notable among these were the journeys of Abdu'l-Baha Ri~iyyih 

KhAnum to India, Southeast 
Asia, the Indian Ocean,    

Africa, Europe and Central 

 and South America. She For full text seep. 57 sup ra. 

 visited hundreds of Baha communities, large and small; went to remote places which no Hand of the Cause and few teachers had ever dared visit before; met all manner of people, high and low alike, from the Maharajah of Sikkim and the President and Prime Minister of India down to the humblest Indian village believers, to the Arnerindians in the far-off San Bias Islands and in the high plateaus of Bolivia. It was during this period that Abdu'l-Baha RP~iyyih KhAnurn released that precious volume The Priceless Pearl, an intimate and personally authoritative account of the life and work of the beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, an abridged version of which appears in The Baha'i World, vol. xiii. 

 The Hand of the Cause Leroy Joas,1 though in failing health, nevertheless embarked upon an extensive teaching trip to the United States during the early months of 1964, attending the National 

Convention in Wilmette     
at RhJv&n of that year.    

 The Hand of the Cause Ugo Gaichery transferred his residence from Europe to the United States in 1964, settling in southern California whence he was able to schedule many trips into Central America and the Caribbean area. 

 He also travelled in Europe, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific area. It was Dr. Giachery who, at the request of the Universal House of 

Justice, presented The     
Proclamation of Baha'u'llah

 to the Vatican, carrying out this mission by presenting the book to Cardinal Paolo 

Morella in Vatican City    
on April 9, 1968.          

 The Hand of the Cause Tar6zu'116h Saman-dan, the only living Hand of the Cause to have attained the presence of Baha'u'llah, was in his late eighties and early nineties during the period covered by this report. Displaying more vigour than most men many years his junior, JinTh-i-Samandari  travelled in almost every part of the northern hemisphere — North Africa, the Arabian  Peninsula, Turkey, PAkistAn, Europe, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, the United States, 

Canada and Alaska. He      

 was one of the few authorities on the handwriting of Bah&-'Deceased  July 22, 1965. See In Memoriam, p. 291 supra.

Upon both Father and Mother Dunn, as they were affectionately known, rests the eternal honour of having established the Cause of Baha'u'llah in the continent of

  u'llAh and His amanuenses, and when he was in the Holy Land he would spend much of his time identifying and classifying original manuscripts,  letters and Tablets. 

 The Hand of the Cause A. A. Furhtan assisted with the pilgrimage programme whenever he was in the Holy Land, spending as much time with the pilgrims as his other duties permitted. 

 He also undertook teaching trips to Turkey, Persia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. In 1967, at the request of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of Persia, Mr. Furiitan wrote a pamphlet answering the attacks made by the enemies of the Faith in that country. 

 The Hand of the Cause Hermann Gross-mann,  though in ill health much of the time during the period covered by this report, nevertheless  made frequent visits to European centres and participated in summer schools. 

 The Hand of the Cause Dhikru'IlAh KhAdem travelled extensively in the United States, Canada and Alaska, participating in many conferences and summer schools and attending several National Conventions, including the National Convention of the Hawaiian Islands in 1966. 

 The Hand of the Cause Shu'~'u'116.h 'AIA'i rendered invaluable services in Persia in connection with the management of the extensive properties of the Faith there, including many Holy Places, and in these matters he was frequently  called upon to conduct important negotiations with the Persian government. 

 His travels outside Persia included India, Algeria and 

Tunisia.                   
   The Hand of the Cause      

Adelbert Muhi-schiegel     

 visited literally hundreds of European centres and attended many conventions, conferences  and summer schools. His travels included  Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, Switzerland, France, the Benelux countries, the Therian Peninsula, 

Yugoslavia and Hungary.    

 The Hand of the Cause Mfls~ Ban&ni, called by the beloved Guardian "The Conqueror of Africa", was forced by physical disabilities and poor health to carry on most of his work from his home in Kampala, Uganda. However, he was able to travel briefly to Tanzania, Kenya and the Holy Land. 

 Notwithstanding his inability to travel, the indomitable spirit of Mr. BanAni permeated the remotest parts of the continent he loved so dearly, and was a source of constant reassurance to the friends. 

 The Hand of the Cause Ja1M KhAzeh made his headquarters in South America during the yegrs 1963 — 1968, and travelled widely though-out that continent. He also visited centres in Persia and Europe as well as in North and Central America. 

 He was very active in the teaching work, and was the initiator of a newsletter  in Spanish which was published in Latin America and widely circulated. 

 The Hand of the Cause Paul Haney, together with his fellow Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land, was busily engaged in coordinating the work of the Continental Hands of the Cause and also assisted in the supervision of the pilgrimage programme. He travelled to many centres in Europe, Vietnam, Japan and the 

United States.             

 The Hand of the Cause 'Au Mutiammad VarqA has acted as Trustee of }juqfiqu'11&h since his appointment as a Hand of the Cause in 1955. 

 He was active in the affairs of the Hands of the Cause in his native Persia and during the summers of several years he came to the Holy Land to assist in administering the affairs of the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land so that those regularly attending to these duties could be released for special teaching assignments or other duties abroad. 

 The Hand of the Cause Agnes Alexander made her headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. Her travels included visits to centres in Persia, the Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Hawaiian Islands. 

 In the summer of 1965, at the age of ninety, she suffered a fall and for the remaining years covered by this report was confined to hospital with a fractured hip. Despite pain and the restrictive nature of her disability, Miss Alexander maintained her usual cheerful spirit, receiving many Baha'i visitors from all over the world. 

 The Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga, the oniy native African to have been appointed a Hand of the Cause, travelled in many countries in both 

East and West Africa       

 during the years 1963 to 1968, transferring his residence to Kenya in 1963. Admired and loved as he is by his fellow African believers, he was spectacularly successful in other continents. 

 The Hand of the Cause William Sears served in both Africa and the Western Hemisphere. He was in Africa for a brief period in 1963 and early 1964, returning to the United States in February of that year. In 1966 he went to

 Africa once more when the Hand of the Cause John Robarts transferred his residence to Canada. Mr. Sears, in addition to his extensive travels in Africa, the United States and Canada, went to Australia in 1963 and to many European countries in 1967. He attended the summer  school in Alaska in 1966.111 1965 and 1966 he figured prominently in the California Victory Campaign which proved to be a very effective mass teaching programme and launched a similar project in British Columbia, 

Canada.                   

 In 1966, after more than thirteen years of pioneering and travelling in Africa, the Hand of the Cause John Robarts returned to his native Canada and took up residence in Raw-don,  Quebec. While in Africa, he visited almost every part of that continent. He also travelled in Europe, the United States, 

Canada and Alaska.        

 Although his health did not permit travel, the Hand of the Cause Jjasan Baha'i devoted himself unstintingly to works of scholarship, undertaking extensive research preparatory to the completion of his volumes on the Central Figures of the Faith as well as a critique of the relationship to the Faith of the orientalist, the late Edward Granville 

Browne.                   

 The Hand of the Cause John Ferraby travelled extensively throughout Europe, attending  many sun-uner schools, conferences and conventions. 

 The Hand of the Cause Collis Peatherstone bore the burden of responsibility for the whole vast Australian area (Australia, New Zealand, Papua, New Guinea and the islands of the South Pacific), traversing frequently its huge distances, visiting remote outposts, island groups, and attending conferences, conventions and summer schools, as well as participating directly in the teaching work. Lie also travelled in other areas, notably in Northeast Asia, SoutheastAsia, Burma, 

India and Ceylon. The     

 Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'i1~h MuhAjir travelled to almost every part of the world. 

 Making his headquarters in the Philippines,  he travelled many times to Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and centres in Southeast Asia as well as to India and Ceylon. In 1965 he made an extensive tour of the mass teaching centres in South and 

Central America. When     

 in the Holy Land at different times he helped with the cataloguing of some of the Tablets. 

 The Hand of the Cause Abu'1-QAsim Faizi made several extensive teaching trips, visiting centres in Europe, Asia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Hawaii and the United States. He wrote many short stories, articles. plays and commentaries, and made a valuable contribution in translating Baha books, including  The Priceless Pearl, from 

English into Persian.     

 In addition to these continuous and world-embracing  services, individual Hands of the Cause were called upon at various times to represent the 

Universal House of Justice

 at Conventions, Conferences and Dedications. These are set forth in separate listings in this section. 
     In its RiQvdn message,    

1967, the Universal House 

 of Justice said of the Hands of the 

Cause:                    

 "Thesefew gallant and dedicated believers, whose place in history is forever assured by virtue of their appointment to their high office, are indeed a precious legacy left to us by our beloved Guardian, and as the years go by there is increasingly added to the honour and respect which is their due by reason of their exalted rank, the love and admiration of the friends evoked by their constant services."

                THE INSTITUTION OF THE
 
                  MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR

  i. FOREWORD "Blessed is he who directetli his steps towards the Mashriqu' iA dhkdr at the hour of dawn, communing with Him, attuned to His remembrance, imploring Hisforgiveness. 

 And having entered therein, let him sit in silence to hearken unto the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Say, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is in truth any House raised in towns or villages, for mention of Me. Thus hat/i it been named before His Throne; would that ye know it." Baha'u'llah, Kitab-i-Aqdas MANY discerning minds have testified to the profoundly significant change which has taken place during recent years in the character of popular religious thinking. 

 Religion has developed an entirely new emphasis, more especially for the layman, quite independent of the older sectarian divisions. 

 Instead of considering that religion is a matter of turning toward an abstract creed, the average religionist today is concerned with the practical applications of religion to the problems of human life. Religion, in brief, after having apparently lost its influence in terms of theology, has been restored more powerfully than ever as a spirit of brotherhood, an impulse toward unity, and an ideal making for a more enlightened civilization throughout the world. 

 Against this background, the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar stands revealed as the supreme expression of all those modern religious  tendencies animated by social ideals which do not repudiate the reality of spiritual experience  but seek to transform it into a dynamic striving for unity. The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar when clearly understood, gives the world its most potent agency for applying mystical vision or idealistic aspiration to the service of humanity. 

 It makes visible and concrete those deeper meanings and wider possibilities of religion which could not be realized until the dawn of this universal age. 

  The term "Mashriqu'l-Adhkar"

 means literally,  "Dawning-place of the praise of God." 

 To appreciate the significance of this Baha'i institution, we must lay aside all customary ideas of the churches and cathedrals of the past. The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar fulfills the original intention of religion in each dispensation, before  that intention had become altered and veiled by human invention and belief. 

 The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is a channel releasing  spiritual powers for social regeneration because it fills a different function than that assumed by the sectarian church. Its essential purpose is to provide a community meeting-place for all who are seeking to worship God, and achieves this purpose by interposing no manmade veils between the worshipper and the Supreme. 

Thus, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar

 is freely  open to people of all Faiths on equal terms, who now realize the universality of Baha'u'llah in revealing the oneness of all the Prophets. Moreover, since the Baha'i Faith has no professional  clergy, the worshipper entering the Temple hears no sermon and takes part in no ritual the emotional effect of which is to establish a separate group consciousness. 

 Integral with the Temple are its accessory buildings, without which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar would not be a complete social institution.  These buildings are to be devoted to such activities as a school for science, a hospice, a hospital, an asylum for orphans. Here the circle of spiritual experience at last joins, as prayer and worship are allied directly to creative service, eliminating the static subjective elements  from religion and laying a foundation for a new and higher type of human association.

        2. THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
                 MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR

            A LETTER FROM SHOGHI EFEENDI

  It should be borne in mind that the central Edifice of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar round which in the fullness of time shall cluster such institutions  of social service as shall afford relief to the suffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the bereaved, and education to the ignorant, should be regarded apart from these Dependencies, as a House solely designed and entirely dedicated to the worship of God in accordance with the few yet definitely prescribed principles established by Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. It should not be inferred, however, from this general statement that the interior of the central Edifice itself will be converted into a conglomeration of religious services conducted along lines associated  with the traditional procedure obtaining in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other temples of worship. 

 Its various avenues of approach, all converging towards the central Hall beneath its dome, will not serve as admittance  to those sectarian adherents of rigid formulae and manmade creeds, each bent, according to his way, to observe his rites, recite his prayers, perform his ablutions, and display the particular symbols of his faith within separately defined sections of Baha'u'llah's 

Universal House of Worship.

 Far from the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar offering such a spectacle of incoherent and confused sectarian observances and rites, a condition wholly incompatible with the provisions  of the Aqdas and irreconcilable with the spirit it inculcates, the central House of Baha worship, enshrined within the Ma~ftriqu'1-A4hk~r, will gather within its chastened walls, in a serenely spiritual atmosphere, only those who, discarding forever the trappings of elaborate  and ostentatious ceremony, are willing worshippers of the one true God, as manifested in this age in the Person of Baha'u'llah. To them will the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar symbolize the fundamental verity underlying the Baha'i Faith, that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is not final but progressive. Theirs will be the conviction that an all-loving and ever-watchful Father Who, in the past, and at various stages in the evolution  of mankind, has sent forth His Prophets as the Bearers of His Message and the Manifestations of His Light to mankind, cannot at this critical period of their civilization withhold  from His children the Guidance which they sorely need amid the darkness which has beset them, and which neither the light of science nor that of human intellect and wisdom can succeed in dissipating. And thus having recognized in Baha'u'llah the source whence this celestial light proceeds, they will irresistibly feel attracted to seek the shelter of His House, and congregate therein, unhampered by ceremonials  and unfettered by creed, to render homage to the one true God, the Essence and Orb of eternal Truth, and to exalt and magnify the name of His Messengers and Prophets Who, from time immemorial even unto our day, have, under divers circumstances and in varying measure, mirrored forth to a dark and wayward world the light of heavenly Guidance. 

 But however inspiring the conception of Baha'i worship, as witnessed in the central Edifice of this exalted Temple, it cannot be regarded as the sole, nor even the essential, factor in the part which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar  as designed by Baha'u'llah, is destined to play in the organic life of the 

Baha'i community.  Divorced

 from the social, humanitarian, educational and scientific pursuits centering  around the Dependencies of the 

Mashriqu'l-Adhkar,  Baha'i

 worship, however exalted in its conception, however passionate in fervor, can never hope to achieve beyond the meagre and often transitory results produced by the contemplations of the ascetic or the communion of the passive worshipper. It cannot afford lasting  satisfaction and benefit to the worshipper himself, much less to humanity in general, unless and until translated and transfused into that dynamic and disinterested service to the cause of humanity which it is the supreme privilege  of the Dependencies of the Mashriqu'1-

  Adhk& to facilitate and promote. Nor will the exertions, no matter how disinterested and strenuous, of those who within the precincts of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will be engaged in administering the affairs of the future Baha'i Commonwealth, fructify and prosper unless they are brought into close and daily communion  with those spiritual agencies centering in and radiating from the central Shrine of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 Nothing short of direct and constant interaction between the spiritual forces emanating from this House of Worship centering in the heart of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and the energies consciously displayed by those who administer its affairs in their service to humanity can possibly provide the necessary agency capable of removing the ills that have so long and so grievously afflicted humanity. For it is assuredly upon the consciousness of the efficacy of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, reinforced on one hand by spiritual communion with His Spirit, and on the other by the intelligent application and the faithful execution of the principles and laws He revealed,  that the salvation of a world in travail must ultimately depend. And of all the institutions  that stand associated with His Holy Name, surely none save the institution of the Ma~~riqu'1-A~~k6r can most adequately provide the essentials of Baha'i worship and service, both so vital to the regeneration of the world. Therein lies the secret of the loftiness, of the potency, of the unique position of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar as one of the outstanding institutions conceived by Baha'u'llah.

       3. THE RAZING OF THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR
                    OF 'ISHQABAD

  The Mashriqu'l-A4j~cdr of 'Iyhqdbdd, Turkistdn. 

  ON August 25, 1963, the 

Universal House of Justice 

 announced to the Baha'i world that the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in 'Ishqabad, the first Temple raised to the glory of Baha'u'llah, had been demolished by the authorities and the site cleared. 

 It was in an unsafe condition due to damage by earthquake. 

 Other than a brief account by a pilgrim, appearing in very early volumes of The Baha'i World, no adequate description of the building or of the real significance of the 'I~hqTh&d Temple has yet appeared in this series. The history of the erection of this edifice, described by Shoghi Effendi as one of 't.. the outstanding achievements that have embellished the brilliant record of 'Abdu'l-Baha's unique ministry" is recounted by the Guardian in God 

Passes By:'                
'pp.300 — SO!.               

 "More conspicuous than any of these undertakings, however, was the erection of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Baha'i world in the city of '~ftqTh~d, a center founded in the days of Baha'u'llah, where the initial steps preparatory to its construction, had beenalreadyunder-taken during His lifetime. 

 Initiated at about the close of the first decade of 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry (1902); fostered by Him at every stage in its development; personally supervised by the venerable 136Jf Mirza Muhammad-Taqi, the Vakilu'd-Dawlih, a cousin of the BTh, who dedicated his entire resources to its establishment, and whose dust now reposes at the foot of Mt Carmel under the shadow of the Tomb of his beloved Kinsman; carried out according to the directions laid down by the Center of the Covenant Himself; a lasting witness to the


<p480>
480                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 fervor and the self-sacrifice of the Oriental believers who were resolved to execute the bidding of Baha'u'llah as revealed in the Kitdb-i-A  qdas, this enterprise must rank not only as the first major undertaking launched through the concerted efforts of His followers in the Heroic Age of His Faith, but as one of the most brilliant and enduring achievements in the history of the first Baha'i century. 

 "The edifice itself, the foundation stone of which was laid in the presence of General Krupatkin, the governor-general of Turkist6.n, who had been delegated by the Czar to represent  him at the ceremony, has thus been minutely  described by a Baha visitor from the West: 'The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar stands in the heart of the city; its high dome standing out above the trees and house tops being visible for miles to the travelers as they approach the town. it is in the center of a garden bounded by four streets. In the four corners of this enclosure are four buildings: one is the Baha'i school; one is the traveler's house, where pilgrims and wayfarers are lodged; one is for the keepers, while the fourth one is to be used as a hospital. Nine radial avenues approach the Temple from the several parts of the grounds, one of which, the principal approach to the building, leads from the main gateway of the grounds to the principal portal of the Temple.' 

 'In plan,' he further adds, 'the building is composed of three sections; namely, the central rotunda, the aisle or ambulatory which surrounds it, and the loggia which surrounds the entire building. 

 It is built on the plan of a regular polygon of nine sides. One side is occupied by the monumental main entrance, flanked by minarets — a high arched portico extending two stories in height recalling in arrangement the architecture of the world famous Taj Mahal at Agra in India, the delight of the world to travelers, many of whom pronounce it to be the most beautiful temple in the world. Thus the principal doorway opens toward the direction of the Holy Land. The entire building is surrounded by two series of loggias — one upper and one lower — which opens out upon the garden giving a very beautiful architectural effect in harmony with the luxuriant semitropical vegetation which fills the garden... The interior walls of the rotunda are treated in five distinct stories. 

 First, a series of nine arches and piers which separate the rotunda from the ambulatory. Second, a similar treatment with balustrades which separate the ti iforium gallery (which is above the ambulatory and is reached by two staircases in the loggias placed one on either side of the main entrance) from the well of the rotunda. Third, a series of nine blank arches filled with fretwork, between which are escutcheons bearing  the Greatest Name. Fourth, a series of nine large arched windows. 

 Fifth, a series of eighteen bull'seye windows. Above and resting on a cornice surmounting this last story rises the inner hemispherical shell of the dome. The interior is elaborately decorated in plaster relief work. 

 The whole structure impresses one by its mass and strength."' The local community and the activities of the friends throughout the provinces of Turkist~n expanded and developed in stature until 1928, when the law expropriating religious edifices was applied to this Temple. However, under the terms of two five-year leases, the Baha'i community was permitted to continue to use the building as a House of 

Worship. In 1938 the Temple

 was completely expropriated and converted  into an art gallery. 

 In 1948 violent earthquakes shook the whole town causing devastation and ruin. 

 The building  was seriously damaged. The oniy section which remained relatively secure was the central rotunda. 

 Heavy yearly rains further weakened the structure to such a degree as to endanger the safety of houses in the vicinity. It was at this point that the authorities decided to demolish the remaining edifice and clear the site. 

 A reliable report indicated that had the Temple been restored to us at this point, we would have had no option but to raze the building ourselves. 

 The Universal House of Justice appealed to Chairman Nikita Khrushchev to set aside the Temple ground as a public park and to agree to the erection of a suitable marker pointing out the significance of this site to the Baha'is of the world. It is not known whether any action was taken. The letter remains unanswered.

         4. DEDICATION OF THE MOTHER TEMPLE

                     OF EUROPE

  The Mother Temple of Europe, Langenhain, West Germany; dedicated July 4, 1964. 

  ON July 4, 1964, the Mother Temple of Europe, near Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was dedicated to the unity of God and of mankind. 

 Nearly one thousand five hundred Baha'is caine from all over the world to participate in this historic event that began with two dedication  services on Saturday morning. 

 An equal number of people, including many Baha'is, attended the public programmes in the afternoon.  The gigantic task of building the first Baha'i House of Worship on the European continent, given to the Baha'is of Germany by Shoghi Effendi over a decade ago and assisted by the believers throughout the world, thus drew to its victorious conclusion. 

 The Temple stands on a low hill in the midst of peaceful, green countryside near the village of Langenhain in the Taunus Hills. 

 Planned and built by Teuto Rocholl, architect from Frankfurt am Main, this House of Worship seats approximately five hundred persons. 

 The diameter at base measures one hundred and fifty-eight feet and there are twenty-seven pillars  supporting the dome on the interior. 

 The construction of the dome is such that a maximum amount of light can enter, bringing about an interesting play of light and shadow, attractively  brightened by the sun's reflection on the five hundred and seventy glass panels. 

 After ascending the low steps encircling the Temple and entering though the clear glass doors, the beauty and light of the interior im

 pels one to look upward to the Greatest Name, set in gold against a light blue background in the apex of the dome. Below the level of the dome, purple and gray-blue draperies line the glass walls, the colour being further enhanced by the many beautiful floral arrangements for this day of dedication. 
                           
   DEDICATION PROGRAMME       

 The Baha dedication programme opened with a solo, the twenty-third Psalm, sung in German by Norman Bailey, the famous English baritone. 

 This was followed by the reading of Baha'i prayers in several languages and the dedication address in German by the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Rfll4yyih Kh.inum the respresntative of the 

Universal House of Justice.

 At the close of her address, she asked all to rise while she read a prayer revealed by Baha'u'llah. 

 This was followed by a prayer of 'Abdu'l-Baha, in German, an extract from the Writings of Baha'u'llah in English, a prayer chanted in Persian and further readings from the Old and New Testaments in 

German. Maria Montana      

 sang a modification of a musical arrangement of the Arabic Hidden Words composed by Charles Duncan. 

 There were readings in German from the Bhagavad-Gita, the Qur'an and the Baha Writings, with additional prayers in Swedish, French and Spanish. The programme concluded with the prayer of Baha'u'llah, From the Sweet-Scented Streams, set to music by Charles Wolcott and sung solo in German. 
                           
    VIEWING OF SACRED          
        PORTRAITS                  
    Following this programme,  

Abdu'l-Baha Rflljiyyih    

 ~num arranged the portraits of Baha'u'llah and the Bab on a table before an exquisite golden and red Persian rug which she had brought from the Holy Land as a gift to the 

German National Spiritual  

 Assembly for the Temple — a tug which had lain in the room of Baha'u'llah at Baha'i. Red roses brought from the grave of the beloved Guardian in London were placed near the portraits. The Baha'is were then privileged to view these sacred pictures, first passing in front of Abdu'l-Baha Riibiyyih KhThum who anointed each one with attar of rose. 

SPECIAL INAUGURAL SERVICE  
FOR                        
       DIGNITARIES                

 Preceding the two public programmes, a special inaugural service was held at 2.30 p.m. for officially invited guests from the government, including regional and local authorities. For this occasion, Ainatu'1-Bah~ RAiiiyyih Kh6nurn read an address in German. 

 A Frankfurt  chorus of twenty voices sang three selections,  a cappella, for this service and for the first of the public programmes which followed. These were Sigt dem Herrn dii neuces Lied by J. S. Bach; Exultate dec, ad]utori nostro by Alessandro Scarlatti sung in Latin; and, for closing, Cantata domini can ticum novum by Schlitz, sung in Latin. 
                           
PUBLICITY IN LEADING NEWSPAPERS

 On July 3 about thirty press representatives had attended a press conference on the Temple dedication. 

 Articles appeared in five leading Frankfurt newspapers and on Saturday and Sunday radio and television publicity occurred. On Sunday, July 5, following the day of dedication, two thousand people visited the Temple. Weeklyinformalprogrammeswereinaugurated. 

 Illuminated at night, the Temple is visible from the city of Frankfurt. 

 Miss Edna True, representative of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, coniimenting on the significance of the Temple dedication said: "As the day of dedication  progressed, the spiritual radiance of this Baha'i House of Worship became increasingly evident, setting aglow the hearts of all who were privileged to be present." 

 The Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land cabled their joy and gratitude:

            EUROPEAN TEACHING CONflRBNCE

  Message of the Universal 

House of Justice           

  To the beloved of God gathered in the European Teaching Conference called on the occasion of the dedication of the Mother Temple of Europe. 

  Dear Baha'i Friends, We have just witnessed the dedication of the Mother Temple of Europe — a project of untold significance and tremendous potential for the spread of the light of God's Faith in that continent.  One of the major achievements called for by our beloved Guardian at the outset of the Ten Year Crusade, this Mashriqu'l-Adhkar was triumphantly raised during its closing years as the fruit of long and arduous labours in the face of determined opposition and upon the sacrificial gifts of believers from all parts of the world. 

 Now dedicated in the opening months of the Nine Year Plan, it forms a striking link between these two great crusades demonstrating  afresh the organic progress of the Cause whereby the efforts exerted in one period bear fruit in the next, which in turn endow the Baha'i Community with new and neater capacities for the winning of still greater victories. 

 You are now gathered in this Conference to deliberate on ways and means of accomplishing the goals which are set before you. Let every believer, as he considers in detail these various goals, bear in mind four supreme objectives: to carry the 

Message of Baha'u'llah     

 to every stratum of society, not only in the towns and cities but also in the villages and country districts  where the virus of materialism has had much less effect on the lives of men; to take urgent, wise and well-considered steps to spread the Faith to those countries of Eastern Europe in which it has not yet become established;  to reinforce strongly the heroic band of pioneers in the islands of the Mediterranean and the North Sea — islands which are to play such an important role in the awakening of the entire continent — as well as to persecute energetically the goals you are called upon to


<p486>
486                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 achieve in other continents and oceans; and to foster the cooperation between 

National Communities      

 and between National Spiritual Assemblies and the Hands of the Cause of God which has contributed so markedly to the work of the Faith on that continent and is so essential  for its future development. 

 Above all let every European Baha'i have ever-present in his mind that these are the five years during which Baha'u'llah sojourned on the soil of that continent a century ago. Let him resolve so to deepen his knowledge of the Faith and so to increase his standards of self-sacrifice and dedication to the Cause as to play his part in building a Community which will be worthy of this supreme bounty and which will be a beacon light to the peoples of this fear-wracked world. 

     In 1953 Shoghi Effendi     

 wrote that the continent of Europe had "at last at this critical hour — this great turning point in its fortunes —  entered upon what may well be regarded as the opening phase of a great spiritual revival that bids fair to eclipse any period in its spiritual histort" Those who have been privileged to witness the extraordinary strengthening and consolidation of the Cause in Europe during the course of the last eleven years are well aware of the reservoir of spiritual potential that has been building up and the transformation of the life of the European Baha Community that has ensued. May the completion and dedication  of the Ma~briqu'1-A4hk~r be the signal for the unleashing of this potential, bringing about on the European mainland and in the islands around its shores a quickening of the process of individual conversion comparable to those events which have transpired with such astonishing  suddenness in other continents of the globe. The Universal House of Justice July, 1964 On Sunday, July 5, the day following the dedication of the Mother Temple of Europe, a European Teaching Conference was held in a spacious hail of the Gesellschaftshaus im Zoo-logischen  Garten. 

 Mter a devotional programme of prayers in several languages, the conference was opened by Rupreclit G. Kruger, chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany who welcomed the representative of the Universal House of Justice, the Hand of the Cause 

Amatu'I-BahA Rfibiyyih     

 Khdnum who had just returned from a teaching trip to India, and the Hand of the Cause John Ferraby of England. Owing to illness, the other European Hands of the Cause were not able to be present at the dedication or the conference. The chairman then greeted representatives of National Spiritual Assemblies from America, Africa, Asia and Australia, as well as from the fourteen centres of Europe outside Germany who participated  in this conference. 
                           
CABLES FROM THE WORLD      
CENTRE                     
   Abdu'l-Baha Riiljiyyih    

 KhAnum the first speaker, read a cablegram from the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land and the message from the Universal House of Justice. She emphasized the major themes contained in that message and pointed out that in these first years of the Nine Year Plan we are living in the same five year period in which, one hundred years ago, Bah&uThh suffered so much on the continent of Europe. The beloved Hand of the Cause conveyed the love and greetings of the Baha'is of India and of their National Spiritual Assembly, stating that she was returning to India and Ceylon after a brief rest. 

 Many messages were received and were read from time to time during the conference, from Hands of the Cause, from National and Local Spiritual Assemblies and from individual Baki'is in all parts of the world. 

 From Hawaii came the gift of a plant for the Temple grounds. 
                           
REPORTS PRESENTED BY FIFTEEN
    NATIONAL SPIRITUAL         
        ASSEMBLES                  

 Reports on how to meet the requirements of the Nine Year Plan were then called for by the conference chairman from the representatives of the fifteen European 

National Spiritual Assemblies.

 The interweaving pattern of the goals, assigned by the Universal House of Justice to each National Assembly, called for a close cooperation between them and the Bah~ 'is in all parts of the world, continuing and extending the work of the beloved Guardian in his Ten Year World Crusade. The representative from each National Spiritual Assembly gave the current statistical status of the Faith in that country, outlined the objectives assigned for the


<p487>
INSTITUTION OF THE MASHRIQU'L-AQJJKLR487

 Nine Year Plan on the homefront and in respect to the tasks in which it must assist or be assisted by other National Assemblies in overseas  and global missions. Many of these representatives  presented plans drawn up by their National Assemblies for achieving their objectives. 
                          
   TEACHING THE MASSES       

 Promptly at 5p.m. it was time for the eagerly awaited address by the Hand of the Cause Abdu'l-Baha Ri~iyyih KhAnum on mass conversion. 

 She told how she had spent four months travelling all over India, accompanied by Mrs. Violette NakhjavAni, visiting especially the villages. She said she now knows that mass conversion is a reality, as she has seen it and experienced it. To her, she said, it is like sowing the seeds of rice — if they are sown in the right soil, they grow profusely, but they will not grow if sown in cement. She said there are more than one hundred thousand Baha in the villages of India. 

 What kind of Baha'is are they? she asked. She stated that they are truly Baha'is, that those who have been Baha'is only a few months are as deeply devoted as the greatest teachers of the Baha'i world. 

 These are the "cream~~ and even though illiterate they are the most outstanding Baha'i teachers in the world today. There are others, she said, who have as yet barely grasped the significance of the Cause they have embraced and there are those in between these two extremes. 

    Abdu'l-Baha Riibiyyih    

 KhAnum said that the Hindus teach in symbols, so in speaking in the villages she used the symbol of the wheel on their ox carts, whose strength is in its hub. She would ask, Is the strength in the rim? No, they would answer. In the spokes? 

 No. In the hub? Yes. She likened the rim to humanity, the spokes to the many different customs and traditions of humanity, its races and religions, and the hub to the Faith of Baha'u'llah which holds all firmly in unity and in perfect balance. This they accepted. 

 She also said: "Let us never give any human being the impression that you become a lBahA'i at the age of fifteen years or that signing a registration card has anything to do with belief You enroll by signing the card in order to be registered, to receive the privileges of the Faith and to protect it, but can anyone," she asked, "think that when 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Bah6. as a boy of eight went to the SiyAh-ChAI to enquire about His Father this child was not yet aBahA'i?" She pointed out that Baha'u'llah commanded all parents to raise their children in the 

Cause of God.             
                          
PUBLIC ADDRESSES GIVEN    
IN                        
         EVENING                   

 The evening of Sunday, July 5, was given over to the public meeting. 

 The two speakers were the Hand of the Cause 

Abdu'l-Baha Rfi1~iyyih   
KhAnum, and Dr. Eugen     

Schmidt, an Auxiliary     

 Board member from Germany. Dr. Schmidt spoke in German on "The Baha'i House of Worship" and outlined its spiritual significance and function, citing passages from Isaiah and from the Arabic Hidden Words in conclusion. 

 The subject of the address in English by Abdu'l-Baha Rii1~iyyih KhAnum was 

"Huma-nity  in Crisis".   

 She referred to the ever-recurring crises in the world, suggesting that they were due to its illnesses. 

 She pointed out that what the world needs today more than anything else is unity. This unity is provided in the Teachings of Baha'u'llah, the Divine Physician. 

 International organizations at present  are not capable of holding in balance all the spokes of the wheel of human affairs; nothing short of the spiritual 

Teachings of Baha'u'llah  

 can achieve this. The Baha'i Faith, she said, is the gift that is being offered to the world, a gift as natural as the coming of spring and the shining of the sun. Annaliese Bopp, secretary of the German National Spiritual Assembly, gave an excellent concurrent translation  into German of this talk. 
                          
      GROUP CONSULTATION HELD   
ON NINE YEAR PLAN         
     On Monday morning, July   

 5, from 8.30 to 10.30, group consultations were held on various topics, each topic being assigned a different meeting place. 

 The topics were: 1. Teaching on the homefront (methods, summer schools, travelling teachers); 2. Cooperation of National Spiritual Assemblies for propagation of the Faith in Europe; 

3. Baha'i Publishing      

 Trusts and the printing and translation of Dah&i literature; 4. Mass media (press, radio, television);  5. 

 Baha'i news exchange (joint publica

 tion); 6. Finances ~1anning, budgets, concentration on special tasks). 

 Summary reports of these consultations were given in the conference hail beginning at 11.00 a.m., with Louis Henuzet, Auxiliary Board member from Belgium as chairman for this session and the afternoon meeting which concluded the conference. 

 All felt that the group consultations and the meeting of the Baha from the various countries participating  in the Nine Year Plan for Europe were of great benefit. 

    The European Teaching Conference

 was attended also by representatives of eleven National Spiritual Assemblies not participating in European objectives of the Nine Year Plan. These were the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha'is of the Arabian Peninsula, of Australia, of Colombia, of the Indian Ocean (Mauritius), of IrAn, of 'IrAq, of North East Africa (Ethiopia), of PAkistAn, of Panama, of Turkey and of Venezuela. 

 Baha were also present from British Guiana, Indonesia and Malaysia. 
                           
   SUMMARY OF CONFERENCE      

 In summarizing the conference, Mr. Henuzet emphasized the need for pioneers and called upon Miss Jessie Revell from the World Centre who read extracts from the words of Shoghi Effendi. 

 The Hand of the Cause John Ferraby pointed out that when one is in the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar one is in the presence of Baha'u'llah, that is as near to being at the Holy Shrines as it is possible to come in Europe; that the Temple is the heart of the European Baha'i community; and that the power of the Covenant  will flow through those who actively follow the path of the Covenant — the path of the Nine Year Plan at this time. 

 The conference was closed with a plea by Abdu'l-Baha Rfi1~iyyih KhAnum to the European Baha'is and particularly the German Baha'is in Frankfurt and the surrounding area, to support the regular weekly programmes of the Temple, pointing out that the eyes of all are now on the Baha. She said: "There is nothing we can give to the Cause; any sacrifice is returned one hundredfold." 

     From the European Teaching 

 Conference a cablegram was sent to the World Centre advising  that one thousand five hundred friends had gathered to deliberate on the message of the Universal House of Justice. The cable expressed appreciation for the bounty of the presence of the Hands of the Cause and reported  that a German believer had volunteered to settle in the East Frisian Islands. In reply, the 

Universal House of Justice 

 cabled:

  (i) DAS HAUS DER ANDACHT DER BAHA Vortrag, ge/rn/ten am S. 7.1964 im Festsaal des Zoologischen Gartens in Frankfurt/Main 

     Seit der Industrialisierung

 des christlichen Abendlandes, insbesondere nach dem ersten Weltkrieg, ist elne waclisende Verweitlichung der Menschheit zu beobachten, die mit elner zunehmenden Schw&chung und Aufsplitterung der 

Lebenskraft der Uberkommenen
Hoch-religionen  einhergeht.

 Religionsfremde und tejiweise religionsfeindliche Ideologien be-herrschen  das Denken und Tun eines niclit geringen 

Teiles der VdIker. Bisherige

 Religions-systeme  finden sich durch sogenannte "Quasi-religionen"  wie Nationalismus, Kommunismus und 

Wissenscbaftsglauben       
in der Verteidigung.       

 Im Hinblick auf diese Entwicklung drangt sich jedem geistig aufgeschlossenen Menschen die Frage auf, ob die tiberkommenen 

Formen der Anbetung Gottes 

 heute noch dem Selbst-verstandnis und der hdheren Selbstverwirk-lichung des veriinderten Menschen und seiner gesellschaftlichen Finriclitungen wirklich zu helfen, bzw. geistig zu fiihren vermdgen. 

Eine Meinungsforschung     

 flber die Motive des schwachen Kirchenbesuclis wtirde vermutlich zu einem nachdenklich machenden Ergebnis fflhren. 
                           
GLAUDEN UND WISSEN — RELIGION UND
WISSENSCHAFT               

 Miissen religidse und wissenschaftliche Glaubigkeit wesensgem~iss zu Widerspriiichen und 

Spannungen ftihren? Wir    

 sind der Auffasstrng, dass verntinftiges Denken und verinnerlichte Glaubigkeit durchaus kein Schisma, keine Entfremdung bedingen! 

Die Suche nach Wahrheit    

 1st geniieinsames An-liegen von Religion und Wissenschaft, von Herz und Verstand. 

Dass wissenschaftliche Wahrheit

 sich nicht immer im rationalen Denken ersch6pft, beweisen intuitiv erworbene Erkenntnisse grosser Wissenschaftler. 

Die Grenzen des Denkens    

 und der Meditation sind fliessender Natur. Andererseits ist zu bedenken, dass wie 

Jleisenberg mit Recht      

 sagt, Glaubens-bekenntnisse, "die fUr die Haltung im Leben verbindlich scm sollen", im Buck auf das heutige naturwissenschaftliche Weitbild un-mdglich  "allein auf wissenschaftliche Erkennt-nis  zu begrtinden" sind. 

     Diese bisherigen Gedankengange

 sollen das VerstKndnis fur den religionsgeschichtlichen Wendepunkt erleiclitern, der in den Gottes-diensten  der 

BahA'i-Weltgemeinschaft    
zu erblicken ist.          

 Die Unteilbarkeit der Wahrheit fflhrt bei tieferer Ejusiclit in die geistigen Lebenszusam-menhange  zur 

Finheit von Religion       

 und Wissenschaft. Das Ethos der Wissenschaft liegt in ihrer unabdingbaren Bindung an die gdttlich geoffenbarte Wahrheit. 

Dogmatisie-rung  der Religion

 einerseits und Sakularisie-rung der Wissenschaft andererseits bedrohen heute die innere und ~ussere Einheit und darnit die Sicherheit der Menschheit. 

  Das Verhaitnis des Menschen

 von heute zu seinem Schdpfer unterliegt durch die geistigen Kififte der Bah&i-Religion seit der 

Mitte des Ietzten Jahrhunderts

 einem Wandel. Scion vor 100 Jahren hat der Stifter tier Bah&f-Religion,  Baha'u'llah, der Welt verkdndet: "Der Glanz der strahienden 

Bar,nherzigkeit Gottes     

 hat die Viliker rind Gesclzlechter der Erde wnhidlt. 

 Bald wird Jer Tag ersekeinen, da day Liclit derg6ttliclien

Anbetung Gottes.           

 Neun Tore nach alien Richtungen symboli-sieren  die Offenheit fUr Menschen aller Rassen und Bekenntnisse, die sich zur Elnigung und Erleuchtung ihrer Herzen unter das Wort Gottes stellen wollen. 

Folgende Worte Baha'u'llah's 

 erhellen den tiefsten Sinn der ritus-und  kultfreien Form, die den Gottesdiensten der Baha'i eigen ist: 

   "11w Fiihrer der Reilgionen!
Messt das Buck Gottes      

 nicht mit soiclien Massen und Wissen-schaft  en, die euch gekiufig sind, denn das Buck seibst 1st die untrugliche Waage, die unter den Menschen aufgestellt worden ist! 

 Auf dieser voilkommenen Waage soil alles gewogen wet-den, was die V6lker und Geschlechter der 

Erde besitzen. Verfdlscht  

 nicht das heilige, allum-fassende Urwort Gottes tend versuclit nicht, seine Ileiligkeit zu entwerten und semen erlia-benen  Charakter herabzuwiirdigen." 
                           
  13cr Ruf Baha'u'llah's      

 wendet sich schon seit 100 Jabren an alle Vdlker, 

Rassen und Bekennt-nisse.  

 Seine Offenbarung gipfelt in dem von Thin enthijilten gbttlichen Hejisplan fUr die Finigung und Befriedung der Menschheit als organische 

Ganzheit. Persdnliche      

 Heilserfah-rung  wird erhbht durch seit Jahrtausenden verheissene Hejisgewinnung fUr die in einem Glauben geeinte Menschheit. Fin neues gottverordnetes Zeitalter ist angebrochen, auf das die Propheten der voraufgegangenen Religionen mehrfach hingewiesen haben. 

 Die Vision des grossen hebraischen Pro-pheten Jesaja "Mein Haus soil cm Bethaus heissen alien Vdlkern" ist in unserer Zeit Wirklichkeit geworden. 
Das gestern in schlich-ter 

Form eingeweihte Haus      

 der Andacht auf cler weithin siclitbaren Anhbhe des vorderen Taunus in Langenhain ist nach dem Willen Baha'u'llah's dazu bestimmt, em Bethaus aller V6lker und Rassen in Erfdllung prophetischer Verheissungen Zn sein. In Nordamerika, nahe Chikago am Michigansee, in Kampala, Uganda (Ostafrika) und in Sydney/Australien dienen bereits Gottesh~iuser gleicher Art ibrer hohen v6lker-und  rassenverbindenden 

Bestinnung. Zur Verbreitung

 des neu geoffenbarten Wortes Gottes werden in den kommenden neun Jabren in yerschiedenen Stadten zwei weitere Rinser der Andacht ibre Tore bffnen. 

   Das Haus der Andaclit      

 verkdrpert in seiner sakralen Bestimmung symboihaft die grund-legende  Erkenntnis, die dem BahA'i-Glauben innewolint, dass religibse Wabrheit nicht absolut, sondern relativ ist, und dass die gdttliche Offenbarung keine abgeschlossene, sondern eine fortscbreitende ist. 

 Die Baha'i sind zutiefst davon Uberzeugt, wie Shoghi Effendi schrieb, "dass em allie-bender  Vater und ailgegenwartiger Vater, der in der Vergangenheit zu bestimmten Zeitab-schnitten der menschuichen Entwicklung Seine Propheten als die Triiger Seiner Botschaft und. 

 Seines Liclites fUr die Menschheit aussandte, in dieser kritischen 

Kulturepoche Semen Kindern 

 niclit die Fubrung versagen kann, die sie in dieser dunklen Stunde dringend bendtigen." 

   Der allumfassende Charakter

 der Bah&'i-Gottesdienste bekraftigt die den vorauf-gegangenen Religionen "zugrundeliegenden ersten und immerw~ihrenden Grunds~itze." 

Die Bahil-Offenbarung      

 bestatigt "die jeder von ihnen innewolinende gottgewollte Autorit~t... und erkiart sie als ihre festeste und eigentlichste Grundlage. 

 Sie betraclitet sie in keinem anderen Lichte denn als verschiedene Stufen in der ewigen Geschichte und andauernden Entwickling einer gdttlichen und unteilbaren Religion, von der sic selber nur em abzul6-sender  Teil ist." ("Die Sendung Baha'u'llah's", S.26.) 

 So kommt einem ilause der Andaclit der Bah&i-Weltgemeinschaft im Sinne seines gbtt-lichen Stifters die einzigartige hohe Aufgabe zu, cm geistig weithin ausstrahlender Brennspiegel des alle Erdenbewohner umhflhlenden 

Lichtes des Wortes Gottes  

 zu sein. Diese Orte der Anbetung sind fur die Angelidrigen aller Religionen der Welt gebaut, auf dass nach Worten 'Abdu'l-Baha's "die EinI'zeit der Men-sclzeit  verkiindet und zur Dienerin Gottes werde." 

 Die gemeinschaftsbildende, schdp-ferisehe  und erleuchtende Kraft des geoffen-batten Wortes Gottes findet in Europa, dem schwergeprtiften Kontinent, durch die 

Gottes-dienste  im BahA'f-Tempel

 auf der Langen-hainer Anh6he ibren tiberzeugenden

 ~. THE MOTHER TEMPLE OF LATIN AMERICA

  The architect's elevation of the Mother Temple of Latin America, to be constructed near Panama-City, Panama. 

  ONE of the many goals assigned to the American Baha'i community in the beloved 

Guardian's Ten Year World  

 Crusade was to assist in the purchase of a site for the future 

Temple in Panama City.     
Land was acquired in       

1954 and Shoghi Effendi    
cabled the United          

States National Assembly   

 in October of that year: "HEARTFELT CONGRATULATIONS 

ACQtJISI-TION  TEMPLE SITE 
NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT        
WORLD CRUSADE."            

 The foremost task assigned to the Baha'is of Panama in the Nine Year Plan was to "erect on your soil the first Ma~hriqu'1-A~hk6r of Latin America." A preliminary survey of the conditions affecting the construction of the Temple was soon undertaken, and in the spring of 1965 the National Spiritual Assembly of Panama, at the request of the Universal House of Justice, extended an invitation to architects, both Baha'i and nonBahA'i, to submit designs for the Temple itself, giving general specifications concerning the site, the climate, the type of building and its approximate size. 

 Nearly fifty designs were submitted by architects of many countries, including Germany,  Belgium, Canada, Italy, the British Isles, Costa Rica, New Zealand, Australia, Lebanon, France, Colombia, Panama and the United States. 

 The task of selecting the architect was made exceedingly difficult in view of the high level of excellence of many designs, most of which demonstrated interesting concepts, imagination, technical competence, and showed an awareness of the unique character of


<p494>
494                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Panama. The submissions were first carefully evaluated by the National Spiritual Assembly of Panama, and then all were sent to Haifa for the consideration of the Universal House of Justice, the National Assembly having indicated the ones which, in their opinion, merited further consideration. 

 Mr. Robed W. McLaughlin, sometime member of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the United States and Dean Emeritus of the School of Architecture of Princeton University, who had been appointed by the Universal House of Justice as its architectural consultant in respect of the erection of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar  in Panama was invited to the Holy Land to assist in the selection of its architect. 

 lit was decided that the design showing the greatest promise was that submitted by Mr. Peter Tillotson, a non-Bah~'i English architect. Mr. McLaughlin proceeded to London to consult with Mr. Tillotson about his proposed design and various details concerning his possible engagement. 

 The services of Mr. Tillotson were retained and his final design embodying certain pre-Columbian architectural  motifs in the wing walls supporting the dome, was approved. 

 In its message to the Baha'i world at Ri4vAn 1966 the Universal House of Justice announced that it was initiating the Panama Temple Fund with a contribution of twenty-five thousand dollars, and called upon individual believers and Baha'i communities everywhere to contribute liberally and continuously until sufficient  funds for the erection of that historic edifice were assured. 

 Further investigation of the site purchased in 1954 revealed that, because of its rugged terrain, it was wholly unsuitable. 

 As the former owner of the land owned additional property in the vicinity, negotiations were entered into to exchange the original site for one more advantageously located. 

 It was soon found that a section known as "Cerro Sonsonate" would be ideal, and in September 1966, following difficult negotiations, an agreement was reached for the property transfer. 

 By RIQv&n 1967 an unpaved road had been cut to the site, enabling the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of Panama to visit that spot for early morning prayers on the occasion of their first meeting of the new Baha'i administrative year. 
     The Hand of the Cause      

Abdu'l-Baha R6~iyyih     

 KbAnum, representing the Universal House of Justice, laid the foundation stone of the future Temple on Sunday, October 8, 1967, assisted by the Hand of the Cause 3a161 Kh&zeh, in the presence of seven hundred believers, including nearly two hundred and fifty of the native Indian friends, all of whom were attending the Intercontinental Conference then being held in Panama City. 
Mr. Peter Tillotson and    

Mr. Robert McLaughlin      
were both present.         

 Preparation of the site, the next step, was begun in 1968 in anticipation of commencing actual construction early in 1969. The top of the mountain was lowered by thirty-six feet, leaving a solid rock foundation, and the extra earth from the site was used to build up a parking area to accommodate approximately fifty cars. 

 Thus were concluded the preliminary steps presaging the letting of the contracts for the building of the 

Mother Temple of Latin America

 in that country often referred to by the Master and the beloved Guardian as the place where two great oceans meet in the Panama Canal. "That place," said 'Abdu'l-Baha, "will become very important in the future. The Teachings, once established there, will unite the East and the West, the North and the South."

THE INSTITUTION OF THE NATIONAL

                 SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY

                  By HORACE HOLLEY

  THE sacred Writings of the Baha'i Faith create organic institutions having a membership  elected by the Baha'i community. Baha'u'llah called these institutions into being; their establishment, definition, training and development came later, in the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha and in that of the Guardian appointed  in 'Abdu'l-Baha's 

Testament.                 

 Since the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1921, the formation of Local Spiritual Assemblies has multiplied in East and West, and the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly has become firmly established. Concerning this national administrative body Shoghi Effendi has provided clear information and direction. Its purpose, its power, its responsibility and its functions and duties are definitely prescribed. 

 "Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by frequent personal consultations the manifold activities of the friends [be-lievers] 

 as well as the Local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy Land Baha'i World Centre], 

 initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the Cause in that country. 

 "It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first in conjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world, to elect directly the members of the International House of Justice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the affairs of the [Faith] 
throughout the world.      

 it has to exercise full authority over all the Local Assemblies in its province, and will have to direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs of the [Faith) in general. 

 "Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly. 

It                         

 will have to refer each of these questions... 

 to a special Committee, to be elected by the members  of the National Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that country... 

 "With it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is strictly local in its nature or whether it should fall under its own province and be regarded as a matter which ought to receive its special attention."' "The need for the centralization of authority in the National Spiritual Assembly, and the concentration of power in the various Local Assemblies, is.. manifest."2 "The authority of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 is undivided and unchallengeable in all matters pertaining to the administration of the Faith [throughout its country]."3 The individual Baha has spiritual citizenship in a world community of believers acting through local, national and international bodies. 

 There is no division of interest or conflict of authority among these institutions, for ever since the ascension of 

Baha'u'llah in 1892 His    

 Faith has possessed infallible guidance by virtue of His Covenant, which specifically provides  it. The action of a Baha'i administrative body, therefore, while rationally determined by constitutional principles, operates in a spiritual realm revealed by the Manifestation of God and maintained free from political pressure and the influence of materialism. 
Apart from the appointed   

Interpreter, no Baha'i    
has individual authority.  

 Decisions are confined to the sphere of action and are made by a body of nine persons. 

 The advice and direction clarifying the nature and operation of a National Spiritual Assembly have been compiled by the 

American Baha'is           

 from letters written them by Shoghi Fffendi.4

<p499>
THE NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY    499

 During the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha, after He had approved the petition submitted to Him by the American Baha'is expressing their desire to construct a House of Worship, these Baha formed a national body known as Baha'i Temple Unity, incorporated for the purpose  of gathering funds and coordinating plans to erect the Temple in Wilmette. That body, though national in scope and elected by delegates representing the various local Baha'i communities, was not a National Spiritual Assembly.  It is interesting to note that in Baha'i Temple 

Unity the American Baha'is

 established a body reflecting their own national historical experience. 

 The local communities preceded the national body in time and each exercised an independent authority in the conduct of its own affairs. When their representatives agreed to form a national IBahA'i body with full jurisdiction  over Temple matters, they transferred to it powers which vested final decision not in its directors but in the 

Annual Convention. The    

 vital distinction between Temple Unity and the National Spiritual Assembly when later established lay in this field of ultimate authority.  The National Spiritual Assembly possessed original authority, powers and functions of its own. 

 It came into existence through election of its nine members at a National Convention but constituted a continuing authority derived from the Baha Teachings and not conferred by any action of the believers, whether as local communities or as delegates. This authority emerged supreme in relation to Baha'i matters within the national community but subject to the higher authority of the Guardian and also of the future International 

House of Justice.         
    Within its own realm the  

National Spiritual Assembly

 is an institution created by the Teachings  of the Faith independent of the Baha'is who elect its members and of the Baha'is composing  its membership. In no way does this institution reflect either the political or the ecclesiastical influences of its environment, whether in America, Europe or the East. This fact has paramount importance. 

 On the one hand it reveals the existence of an organic religious society; on the other hand it demonstrates the freedom of this new community from the legalisms and devices acting within every human institution. 

 While the transition from Baha'i Temple Unity to 

National Spiritual Assembly

 in North America emphasizes certain principles inherent in Baha'i institutions, the formation of a National Spiritual Assembly in a new area represents more profoundly the creation of a new type of society. 

Every national Baha'i     

 community  has gone through some evolution reflecting its historical background before its National Spiritual Assembly was established. 

 The functions of a National Spiritual Assembly  are manifold: the publication of Baha'i literature; national teaching plans; supervision of local communities; encouragement and direction of all the Baha in their service to the Faith; and representation of the Baha'is in relation to the civil authorities. 

 Each national body prepares and adopts its own constitution, formulated  on the basis of the model approved by the Guardian of the 

Baha Faith. All the National
Spiritual Assemblies      

 collectively, under the title of The Baha'i International Community, constitute an international nongovernmental  organization whose delegates are accredited by United Nations for attendance and participation in its regional conferences. 

 Through the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly, Baha'is are enabled to carry out plans of considerable magnitude, collaborate  with Baha'is of all other lands in matters of international interest, maintain common  standards of administrative principle, and take advantage, in the appointment of committees, of particular talents and aptitudes possessed by individual believers. 

The National Spiritual    

 Assembly stands as one of the pillars supporting the Baha'i world community. 

 Participation  in national Baha'i activities serves to insulate the individual Baha'i from infection by the psychic ills which afflict modern society as result of its lack of faith and spiritual direction. Within the shelter of this emerging order the storms of partisanship cannot engulf the soul.

500                THE BAHA'I WORLD

                      FOREWORD

 THE 1926 — 27 National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada completed a task which, while pertaining to the outer and more material aspects of the Cause, nevertheless has a special significance for its spirit and inward sacred purpose. This task consisted in creating a legal form which gives proper substance and substantial character to the National Spiritual Assemblies and the administrative processes embodied in the Baha'i Teachings by a form of incorporation recognized under common law. This Declaration of Trust, with its attendant ByLaws, became the model to be followed, with adaptations as local laws and circumstances required, by other National Spiritual Assemblies. The years following the election of the Universal House of Justice witnessed a great increase in the number of National Spiritual Assemblies (from fifty-seven in 1963 to eighty-one in 1968) and the House of Justice itself provided a model document, , largely based on the one devised by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, to be followed as closely as possible by all new National Spiritual Assemblies as they became incorporated, which they were required to do under the Nine Year Plan. 

 Careful examination of the Declaration, and its ByLaws will reveal the fact that this document contains no arbitrary elements nor features new to the Baha'i Cause. On the contrary, it represents a most conscientious effort to reflect those very administrative principles and elements already set forth in the letters of the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, and already determining the methods and relationships of Baha'i collective association. The provision both in the Declaration and in the ByLaws for amendments in the future will permit the National Spiritual Assemblies to adapt this document to such new administrative elements or principles as may at any time be given forth. 

 The Declaration, in fact, is nothing more nor less than a legal parallel of those moral and spiritual laws of unity inherent in the fullness of the Baha'i Revelation and making it the fulfillment of the ideal of Religion in the social as well as spiritual realm. Because, in the Baha Faith, this perfect correspondence exists between spiritual and social laws, the Baha'is believe that administrative success is identical with moral success, and that nothing less than the true Baha'i spirit of devotion and sacrifice can inspire with effective power the worldwide body of unity revealed by Baha'u'llah.

     The Twenty-sixth Annual    

 Convention [of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada], held in 1934, voted a recommendation calling upon the National Spiritual Assembly to supply a parliamentary procedure for the conduct of the Annual Convention, and the present material has been prepared to meet the need indicated by that recommendation.

 Convention message to the Guardian of the Faith. 

     Annual Committee Reports:  

 These are to be considered as part of the Report of the National Spiritual Assembly. They are whenever possible published in Baha'i News in advance of the Convention date, for the information of the delegates. 

     Subjects for Consultation: 

 Any delegate may, before the Convention convenes, recommend  to the National Assembly such topics as he deems of sufficient importance to be included in the Convention agenda; and the National Spiritual Assembly, from the list of topics re ceived from delegates, and also suggested by its own knowledge and experience, is to prepare an agenda or order of business as its recoin-mendation to the Convention. 

 This agenda may include, as part of the National Assembly's Annual Report, the presentation  of special subjects by well qualified members, committee representatives or nonBahA'i  experts whose exposition is necessary or desirable for the information of the delegates. 

 On motion duly made, seconded and voted, any such subject may be omitted, and also on motion duly made, seconded and voted, any other subject may be proposed for special consultation. 

 Annual Election: The election of members of the National Spiritual Assembly is to take place approximately midway during the Convention sessions, so as to enable the delegates to consult with both the outgoing and incoming Assemblies,  in accordance with the Guardian's expressed desire. 
                           
Conduct of Business        

 Every deliberative body, to fuiffi its functions, must conduct its deliberations in accordance  with some established rules of order. The parliamentary procedure here set forth for the Convention is based upon the procedure already  adopted for meetings of Local Assemblies  and communities. It accordingly extends to sessions of the Annual Convention the same procedure under which the delegates, in their other Baha'i activities, are accustomed to conduct  discussion and consultation. 

 The purpose of consultation at the Annual Convention is threefold: to arrive at full and complete knowledge of the current conditions, problems and possibilities of the Faith in America; to give to the incoming National Assembly the benefit of the collective wisdom, guidance and constructive suggestions of the assembled delegates; and to contribute to the unity, in spirit and in action, of the entire American Baha'i community. 

 The freedom of each and every delegate to


<p509>
THE NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY    509

 take part in discussion and to initiate motions is untrammeled save as the undue activity of one delegate might hamper the rights of the other delegates. Any necessary limitation to be placed upon individual discussion shall be determined by the Chairman in the absence of any specific motion duly voted by the delegates themselves. 

 It shall be the duty of the Chairman to encourage general consultation and make possible the active participation of the greatest possible number of delegates. 

 The Chairman has the same power and responsibility for discussion and voting upon motions as other delegates. Members of the outgoing and incoming National Assembly who are not delegates may participate in the consultation but not vote. 

 A resolution, or motion, is not subject to discussion or vote until duly made and seconded. It is preferable to have each resolution clear and complete in itself, but when an amendment is duly made and seconded, the Chairman shall call for a vote on the amendment first and then on the motion. An amendment must be relevant to, and not contravene, the subject matter of the motion. 

 The Chairman shall call for votes by oral expression of ayes and nays, but where the result of the vote is doubtful by a show of hands or a rising vote. A majority vote determines. 

 Discussion of any matter may be terminated by motion duly made, seconded and voted, calling upon the Chairman to bring the matter to an immediate vote or proceed to other business. 

 The transactions of the Convention shall be recorded by the Secretary, and when certified by the Convention officers shall be given to the National 

Spiritual Assembly.        
Annual Election            

 The electors in the Annual Election shall consist of those delegates included in the Roll Call prepared by the National Spiritual 

Assembly.                 

 Ballots and tellers' report forms shall be provided by the National Assembly. 

 The election shall be conducted by the Convention, but delegates unable to attend the Convention shall have the right to vote by mail. 

 The Chairman shall appoint three tellers, chosen from among the assembled delegates. 

 The electoral method shall be as follows: 

     1. The Convention Secretary

 shall call the roll of delegates, whereupon each delegate, in turn, shall place his or her ballot in a ballot box; and as the names are called ballots received by mail shall be placed in the ballot box by the Secretary of the National Assembly. 

 2. The ballot box shall then be handed to the tellers, who shall retire from the Convention Hall to determine the result of the election. 

 3. The result of the election is to be reported by the tellers, and the tellers' report is to be approved by the Convention. 

 4. The ballots, together with the tellers' report, certified by all the tellers, are to be given to the National Spiritual Assembly for preservation. 
                           
III. THE CONVENTION RECORD 

  The permanent record of each successive Annual Convention shall consist of the following:  — (1) Convention Call as issued by the National Spiritual Assembly; (2) list of accredited  delegates; (3) Annual Reports of the National Spiritual Assembly and of its Committees; (4) Messages sent to and received from the 

World Centre; (5) Resolutions

<p511>
THE LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY'

        The Institution and Its Significance

  THE institution of the Spiritual Assembly was created by Baha'u'llah and is an integral part of His Revelation, together with the teachings, principles, supplications, truth, and laws written  in the 

Books and Tablets. It     

 is the foundation  stone of the new World Order, the establishment  of which is the essential aim of the Baha'i Faith. 

 Though the loyalty of the believers  who assist in the unfoldment of its latent attributes and poWers, divine guidance and reinforcement is promised, and the forces of unity, justice, affection and fellowship arc made to prevail over the negative elements which prey upon and destroy the civilization of an unbelieving  age. 

 "...To it (Local Assembly) all local matters pertaining to the Cause must be directly and immediately referred for full consultation and decision. The importance, nay the absolute necessity of these Local Assemblies is manifest when we realize that in the days to come they will evolve into the local House of Justice, and at present provide the firm foundation on which the structure of the Master's Will is to be reared in future." 
B.A., p. 37.              

 "In order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not fall a prey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its purity and pristine vigor, that its affairs may be conducted with efficiency and promptness, it is necessary that every one should conscientiously take an active part in the election of these Assemblies, abide by their decisions, enforce their decree, and cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task of stimulating the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. 

 The members  of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly their own likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and concentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce to the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i Community and promote the common weal." B.A., p. 41. 

 From The Baha'i Community, BPS., Wilmette 1963. 

Formation of a Local Spiritual
Assembly                  

 When the requisite conditions exist, the local group of Baha'is is obligated to establish an Assembly. 

 It is not an optional matter. 

 The. requisite conditions are simple. They include the following: 1. There must be nine or more adult Baha'is in good standing resident in the community. 

 2. These Baha'is are to be declared and recognized believers, all meeting qualifications of faith laid down by the Guardian. 

 If one or more members of the group are such newly-confirmed  Baha'is that they are not yet recorded as believers by the National Spiritual Assembly, these new believers are to take a full part in the formation of the Assembly, subject to later determination of their Baha'i status. 

     3. Each Local Assembly    

 has a definite area of jurisdiction. In most cases the area is that of the civil boundaries of an incorporated village, town or city. An Assembly may also be formed by nine or more Baha'is who reside in the same township or county or unincorporated village. 

 Where the area of jurisdiction is a township, there must be nine or more adult Baha'is resident  therein outside the limits of any incorporated  town or city in the township, as each Baha'i civil area must be separate and distinct from other areas where an Assembly might later be formed. 

 Where the area ofjurisdiction is a county, the county itself must be small enough to permit all the believers to meet regularly. 

 The county unit constitutes a Baha area of jurisdiction only when in it there are nine or more Baha who have access to no smaller civil area such as township or permanent electoral district. Postal areas and school districts do not represent  areas of jurisdiction for Baha'i 

Assemblies.               

 4. At the present time there is oniy one date when Local Assemblies can be formed — April 21 of any year. As the Baha'i calendar consists of days which begin and end at sunset rather than midnight, the time to form an Assembly 511


<p512>
512                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 is after sunset on April 20 and before sunset on April 21. 

 5. Where there are more than nine adult Baha, they form an Assembly by electing the nine members of the Spiritual Assembly. Where there are exactly nine adult Baha'is, they establish an Assembly by joint declaration, and all nine members must participate. 

The National  Spiritual  

 Assembly provides different types of report forms for these two methods, and the group should apply for the proper form in advance. 

 (For further information refer to the following section on "The Annual 

Election and Organization.")

  The Annual Election and 

Organization              
    "These Local Spiritual    

 Assemblies will have to be elected directly by the friends, and every declared believer of 21 years and above, far from standing aloof and assuming an indifferent  or independent attitude, should regard it his sacred duty to take part conscientiously and diligently, in the election, the consolidation and the efficient working of his own Local Assembly." 
B.A., p. 39.              

 "Pending its (the Universal House of Justice) establishment, and to ensure uniformity throughout the East and throughout the West, all Local Assemblies will have to be reelected once a year, during the first day of RicJv~n, and the result of polling, if possible, be declared on that day." B.A., p. 41. 

 The annual meeting on April 21, called for the election of the Spiritual Assembly, provides the occasion for the presentation of annual reports by the Assembly and by all its committees. 

 The chairman of the outgoing Assembly presides  at this meeting. 

  The order of business includes: Reading of the call of the meeting Reading of appropriate Baha'i passages bearing upon the subject of the election Appointment of tellers Distribution of ballots Prayers for the spiritual guidance of the voters The election by secret ballot Presentation of annual reports Tellers' report of the election Approval of the tellers' report Assembly members are elected by plurality vote. The believers receiving the nine highest votes on the first ballot are elected, unless two or more are tied for ninth place. In case of a tie, a second ballot is cast by those present, and on this ballot the voter is to write the name of one of those who are tied in the fist ballot. 

 Contrary to the ways of the world, Baha'i elections are approached in a spirit of prayer without preliminary electioneering or nominating of candidates. Before the ballots are cast, prayers should be read and all participating ask for guidance in selecting those best fitted to serve. 

 In this regard the Guardian wrote: Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated  assurances that every Assembly elected in that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness  and detachment is, in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and with cheerfulness." 
B.A., p. 65.              

 "...the elector.., is called upon to vote for none but those whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold. Moreover, the practice of nomination, so detrimental to the atmosphere of a silent and prayerful election, is viewed with mistrust Should this simple system (based on plurality) be provisionally adopted, it would safeguard the spiritual principle  of the unfettered freedom of the voter, who will thus preserve intact the sanctity of the choice he first made.. ." B.A., p. 136. 

 "The newly elected Assembly is called together  by the believer who received the highest number of votes, or in case two or more members  have received the same said highest number  of votes, then by the member selected by lot from among those members; and this member shall preside until the permanent chairman is chosen." ByLaws of a L.S.A., Art. VIII. 

 It is preferable to have the election of the officers of the Assembly immediately following the annual election or formation by joint declaration; however, all nine members of the Assembly must be given an opportunity to vote for the officers. 

 In rare instances a meeting for the election of officers cannot be called because of inability on the part of one or more members to attend. In such cases, the best procedure is to elect or appoint immediately a temporary chairman and secretary to serve until such time as all members of the Assembly can be present to vote in person.


<p513>
THE LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY      513

 Permanent officers are elected by secret ballot and by majority rather than by plurality vote. (Plurality is the largest number; majority is the number greater than halt which, in this case, is at least five out of the nine.) 

 When an Assembly is organized, it is to report its formation and election of officers to the National Spiritual Assembly, together with whatever relevant facts may be necessary for recognition of the Assembly. 
                           
Dissolution of a Local     
Spiritual Assembly         

 Once elected or formed by joint declaration, an Assembly continues to exist until the next annual election or until the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 acts to declare the Assembly dissolved.  This decision is not to be made by the members of the Local Assembly itself nor by any regional or national committee. 

 If the number of adult Baha'is in the community becomes less than nine, or other conditions  arise which make it impossible for the Local Assembly to function, the facts should be reported to the National Assembly for final determination of the status of the 

Assembly.                  
                           
Authority and Functions    
   The Local Spiritual Assemblies

 are "invested with an authority rendering them unanswerable for their acts and decisions to those who elect them; solemnly pledged to follow, under all conditions, the dictates of the 'Most Great Justice' that can alone usher in the reign of the 'Most Great Peace' which Baha'u'llah has proclaimed  and must ultimately establish; charged with the responsibility of promoting at all times the best interests of the communities within their jurisdiction, of familiarizing them with their plans and activities and of inviting them to offer any recommendations they might wish to make; cognizant of their no less vital task of demonstrating, through association with all liberal and humanitarian movements, the universality and comprehensiveness of their Faith; dissociated entirely from all sectarian organizations,  whether religious or secular; assisted by committees annually appointed by, and directly responsible to, them, to each of which a particular  branch of Baha activity is assigned for study and action; supported by local funds to which all believers voluntarily contribute. 
G.P.B., p. 331.            

 The various functions of the Local Spiritual Assembly, and its nature as a constitutional body, are duly set forth in Article VII of the ByLaws of the National Spiritual Assembly, and more definitely defined in the ByLaws of a Local Spiritual Assembly approved by the National Spiritual Assembly as recommended by the Guardian. 

Each Local Spiritual       

 Assembly of the United States, whether or not legally incorporated, is to function according to those ByLaws, and all members of the local Baha'i community shall be guided and controlled by their provisions. 

 An essential function of Local Spiritual Assemblies is to act as intermediaries between the local communities and the National Spiritual 

Assembly. The Local Assembly

 is, therefore,  the proper medium through which local Baha'i communities can communicate with the body of their national representatives. 
                           
Appointment of Committees  

 In the appointment of committees, only those committees needed to carry out the activities of the community are necessary. Such committees are appointed by the Assembly from among the entire membership of the community, have specific functions to perform, and are responsible  to the Assembly who will exercise constant and general supervision over their work. Before making appointments, it is usually beneficial  to discuss the special abilities, aptitudes and personal wishes of the members under consideration in relation to the tasks which are to be performed by the committees. 
                           
Meetings                   

 A meeting of the Spiritual Assembly is valid oniy when it has been duly called, that is, when each and every member has been informed of the time and place. The general practice is for the Assembly to decide upon some regular time and place for its meeting throughout the Baha'i year, and this decision when recorded in the minutes is sufficient notice to the members. When the regular schedule cannot be followed, or the need arises for a special meeting, the secretary, on request by the chairman, or, in his absence or incapacity, of the vice-chairman, or of any three members of the Assembly, should send due notice to all the members. 

 The procedure for the calling of the Annual Meeting is outlined in Article XI of the ByLaws  of a 

Local Spiritual Assembly.

<p515>
THE LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY      515
Prime Requisites           

 "The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and longsuffering in difficulties and servitude to 

His exalted Threshold.     

 Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Bah6. shall be vouchsafed to them. In this day, assemblies of consultation are of the greatest importance and a vital necessity. Obedience unto them is essential and obligatory." B.A., p. 21. 

 "The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of the Assembly.  They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. 

 Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be nonexistent, that gathering shall be dispersed and that Assembly be brought to naught. 

 "The second condition: — They must when coming together turn their faces to the Kingdom  on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory. 

 They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation  to express their views. They must in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence  in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. 

 The honoured members must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with moderation  set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion arise a majority of voices must prevail;  and all must obey and submit to the majority. It is again not permitted that any one of the honoured members object to or censure,  whether in or out of the meeting, any decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for such criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. 

 "In short, whatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and purity of motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement prevail the result shall be darkness  upon darkness. 

 If this be so regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One Should they endeavor  to fulfill these conditions the Grace of the lloiy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become the center of Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of spirit." B.A., pp. 22 — 23. 

  Recommended Agenda and 

Procedure                  

 Since order is an important characteristic of the 

Baha'i World Faith, Baha'is

 should conduct their business in an orderly manner. 

 The following agenda is suggested for meetings of the Local Spiritual 

Assembly:                  
                           
    Prayer                     

 Reading and approval of minutes of previous meeting Report of Secretary (or 

Corresponding Secretary)   

 including correspondence of interest and concern to the body of the believers, and any and all recommendations duly adopted by the community at the last Nineteen Day 

Feast                      
  Report of Treasurer        
  Report of Committees       

 Unfinished business New business, including conferences with members of the community and with applicants  for enrollment as members of the community Closing prayer A Spiritual Assembly, in maintaining its threefold function of a body given (within the limits of its jurisdiction) an executive, a legislative and a judicial capacity, is charged with responsibilities for initiating action and making decisions. 

 Its meetings, therefore, revolve around various definite matters which require deliberation and collective decision, and it is incumbent upon the members, one and all, to address themselves to the chairman on the subject  under discussion and not introduce matters irrelevant to the subject. 

 Baha'i principles of consultation and majority  rule are requisite characteristics in Baha'i Administration, and represent radical departures  from the generally accepted rules of parliamentary procedure. In Baha'i Assembly action, the chairman takes part in the discus

 sion, and a majority decision becomes unanimous  and binding upon all. There is no minority opinion in Baha Administration; the decision of the majority is the decision of all. 

 Every subject or problem before an Assembly is most efficiently handled when the following process is observed: First, ascertainment and agreement upon the facts; Second, agreement upon the spiritual or administrative principle which is involved; Third, full and frank discussion of the matter, leading up to the offering of a resolution; and, Fourth, voting upon the resolution. 

 A resolution, or motion, is not subject to discussion or vote until duly made and seconded.  It is preferable to have each resolution clear and complete in itself, but when an amendment is duly made and seconded, the chairman shall call for a vote on the amendment first and then on the original motion. An amendment must be relevant to, and not contravene, the subject matter of the motion. 

 Oniy one motion should be considered at a time. 

 The procedure for handling motions is: 1. Statement of motion 

     2. Second                  
     3. Discussion of the motion

     4. Voting                  

 5. Announcement of the result of the voting. Amendments are to be voted on before the main motion. Motions can be amended only once, by one of the following actions: adding, striking out, inserting, striking out and inserting,  substituting, dividing. 

 An action may be agreed upon by the Assembly without going though the formality of making amotion and voting upon it; however, if the agreement is not unanimous the question must be put to a vote. 

 The chairman, or other presiding officer, has the same right and responsibility as other members  of the Assembly for discussing and voting upon all matters being considered by the Assembly. 

 Discussion of any subject before the Assembly  may be terminated by a motion duly made, seconded and voted, calling upon the chairman to put the matter to a vote or to proceed to the next matter on the agenda. The purpose of this procedure is to prevent any member or members  from unnecessarily prolonging the discussion beyond the point at which full opportunity has been given all members to express their views. 

 A motion to adjourn is always in order and has priority over all other motions except the motion to fix the time of the next meeting. The motion to adjourn is not debatable and cannot be amended. 

 It requires a majority vote. Before voting, however, the presiding officer should point out items of unfinished business on the agenda, so that the members will know whether to vote for or against adjournment at that moment. 

 A motion may be withdrawn by the mover, provided no one objects, and before a vote has been taken. 

 When the Assembly has taken action upon any matter, the action is binding upon all members, whether present or absent from the meeting at which the action was taken. 

 Individual  views and opinions must be subordinated to the will of the Assembly when a decision has been made. A Spiritual Assembly is an administrative unit, as it is a spiritual unit, and therefore no distinction between "majority" and "minor-ity"  groups or factions can be recognized. 

 Each member must give undivided loyalty to the institution to which he or she has been elected. 

 Any action taken by the Assembly can be reconsidered at a later meeting, on motion duly made, seconded and carried. This reconsideration, according to the result of the consultation, may lead to a revision or the annulment of the prior action. If a majority is unwilling to reconsider the prior action, further discussion of the matter by any member is improper. 
                           
Vacancies on Assembly      

 The Assembly has a responsibility in filling a vacancy caused by the inability of any member  to attend the meetings. "It is only too obvious  that unless a member can attend regularly the meetings of his Local Assembly, it would be impossible for him to discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfill his responsibilities as a representative of the community. Membership in a Local Spiritual Assembly carries with it, indeed, the obligation and capacity  to remain in close touch with local Baha'i activities, and ability to attend regularly the sessions of the Assembly." 

 Letter from Shoghi Effendi, Feb. 16, 1935. 

 When a vacancy on an Assembly involves also one of its officers, the Assembly vacancy


<p518>
518                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 is filled in the usual manner by election at a special meeting of the local Baha'i community, after which the entire Assembly elects the new officer. 
                           
Minutes and Files          

 The Spiritual Assembly, as a permanent body, is responsible for maintaining all minutes of its meetings, important records and cones-pondence,  and financial records throughout its existence as a Baha'i institution. 

 Each officer, therefore, on completing his or her term of office, shall turn over to the Assembly all records and files pertaining to the business of the Assembly. A permanent record of minutes is of special importance and necessity when an Assembly is incorporated, because situations could arise which would make it necessary to produce the minutes for inspection by state authorities. 

 Other items which would be of historical interest in the future should be kept in the local archives. 

 It is vitally important that each Local Spiritual Assembly maintain a complete file of Baha'i News and the US. Supplement for reference on various directives regarding laws and procedures, teaching suggestions, and other pertinent  information. 

 It should also maintain and keep up to date a file of all special instructions and statements from the National Spiritual Assembly dealing with matters of permanent value. 

 Minutes are the permanent official record of the meeting taken by a secretary. 

 If the community  is large and the Assembly handles a great amount of business, a recording secretary may be elected to record the minutes. The minutes should include all essential details, such as the election of the Assembly and its officers at the beginning of each year, by-elec-tions  for filling vacancies on the Assembly occurring during the year, attendance of all members at its meetings, new enrollments and transfers, marriages, and deaths. 

 All carried motions are recorded in the minutes. 

 The minutes should be written in such a way as to provide sufficient background to understand the reason for the motions and decision, but the entire discussion does not need to be recorded. 

 It is not necessary to record names of individuals making and seconding motions or making comments during the dis cussion. Names are of importance, however, when the minutes record reports given on special assignments or situations, or when assignments are given to particular individuals. 

 If a decision is adopted by common consent without the formality of a motion, even this decision should be clearly stated by the chairman  and recorded in the minutes so that there is no question as to what action was agreed upon by the group. 

 Correspondence should be listed in the minutes. 

 Copies of important outgoing correspondence,  in addition to the incoming letters, should be kept for the files. 

 Record should be made in the minutes of consultation with individuals meeting with the Assembly, whether requested by the individual or the Assembly. 

 Minutes should be written or typed legibly. They should be corrected and approved by the Assembly before they become a matter of permanent record. 

     Records of Nineteen-Day    

 Feasts need include  only the recommendations made by the community to be presented to the Local Spiritual Assembly, with the background necessary  for understanding them. 

 Minutes of Assembly meetings are not read at the Nineteen-Day Feasts; only the actions taken by the Assembly which concern the community affairs are reported at Feasts. The judgment of what should be shared at the Feasts belongs to the Local Spiritual 

Assembly.                  
                           
Legal Incorporation        

 Local Assemblies having fifteen or more active adult believers in the community are authorized to effect legal incorporation. 

 To do so the matter should be presented at a Nineteen-Day Feast and a recommendation adopted which expresses the desire of the community that the Spiritual Assembly be legally incorporated. 

 The Baha'i World volumes reproduce many local Certificates of Incorporation which supply models for consideration by the Assembly's attorney. 

 What is incorporated is the Spiritual Assembly, not the entire community. 

 The community  is associated with the instrument though the annual election of the Local Assembly  and the Spiritual Assembly's authority to enroll new believers and determine the membership  list.


<p519>
THE LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY      519
     The Articles of Incorporation

 are to make proper reference to the Central Figures of the Faith and to the 

National Spiritual Assembly. If

 necessary, the National Assembly on request will provide an example of how this is to be done. 

     Before the Incorporation   

 papers are recorded, a copy is to be sent to the National Spiritual Assembly for final approval. After recording, three photostatic copies of the recorded Articles are to be sent to the National Spiritual Assembly,  together with a photograph of the nine Assembly members. 

 Incorporation must be preserved in accordance with the manner prescribed by state law. 
                           
  THE NINETEEN-DAY FEAST     

 The institution of the Nineteen-Day Feast provides the recognized and regular occasion for general consultation on the part of the community, and for consultation between the Spiritual Assembly and the members of the community. The conduct of the period of consultation  at Nineteen-Day Feasts is a vital function of each Spiritual Assembly. 
  From words of 'Abdu'l-Baha,

"The Nine-teen-Day  Feast  

 was inaugurated by the Bab and ratified by Baha'u'llah, in His Holy Book, the Aqdas, so that people may gather together and outwardly show fellowship and love, that the Divine mysteries may be disclosed. The object is concord, that through this fellowship hearts may become perfectly united, and reciprocity and mutual helpfulness be established. Because the members of the world of humanity are unable to exist without being banded together, cooperation and helpfulness is the basis of human society. 

 Without the realization of these two great principles no great movement is pressed forward." B.W., Vol. XII, p. 298. 

    The Nineteen-Day Feast     

 has been described by the Guardian as the foundation of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. It is to be conducted  according to the following programme: the first part, entirely spiritual in character, is devoted to the reading of Baha'i Prayers and selections from the Baha'i Sacred Writings; the second part consists of general consultation on the affairs of the Cause; the third part is the material feast and social meeting of all the believers, and should maintain the spiritual nature of the 

Feast.                     

 In selecting the readings for the devotional part of the Feast the friends may be guided by the latest instructions printed in Baha'i News quoting the following excerpt from a letter to a believer from the Guardian though his assistant  secretary dated April 27, 1956: "The Writings  of the Bab and Baha'u'llah can certainly be read at any time at any place; likewise the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha are read freely during the spiritual part of the Feast. The Guardian has instructed that during the spiritual part of the Feast, his own writings should not be read. In other words, during the spiritual part of the Feast, readings should be confined to the Writings of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and to a lesser extent, of the Master; but during that part of the Feast the Guardian's writings should not be read. During the period of administrative discussion  of the Feast, then the Guardian's writings may be read. Of course, during the administrative part of the Feast there can be no objection  to the reading of the Writings of the Bab, Baha'u'llah or 'Abdu'l-Baha." Baha'i News, Jan. 1959. 

 Baha'is should regard this Feast as the very heart of their spiritual activity, their participation  in the mystery of the Holy Utterance, their steadfast unity one with another in a universality  raised high above the limitations of race, class, nationality, sect, and personality, and their privilege of contributing to the power of the Cause in the realm of collective action. 
                           
Attendance                 

 Only members of the Baha'i community and visiting Baha from other localities may attend these meetings. 

 Young people between fifteen and twenty-one years of age, who have declared their acceptance of the qualifications of membership  in the Faith are considered as members although they are referred to as Baha'i youth. Children up to age fifteen, of Baha'i parents, may also attend the Nineteen-Day Feasts. 

 Regular attendance at the Nineteen-Day Feast is incumbent upon every Baha, illness or absence from the city being the only justification  for absence. Believers are expected to arrange their personal affairs so as to enable them to observe the Baha'i calendar. 

  Order of Business for the Consultation Period The chairman or other appointed representa-. tive of the Spiritual Assembly presides during the period of consultation.

THE LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY      521
     The Spiritual Assembly     

 reports to the community whatever communications have been received from the World Centre and the National Spiritual Assembly, as well as other correspondence of concern to all believers of tbe community. This does not necessarily mean that all communications must be read in full at the Feast. 

 A matter of vital importance at this meeting is consideration of national and international Baha'i affairs, to strengthen the capacity of the community to cooperate in promotion of the larger Baha interests and to deepen the understanding of all believers concerning the relation of the local community to the Baha'i 

World Community.           

 The Assembly likewise reports its own activities and plans, including committee appointments that may have been made since the last Feast, the financial report, arrangements made for public meetings, and in general shares with the community all matters that concern the Faith. 

 These reports are to be followed by general consultation. 

 Provision is to be made for reports from committees, with discussion of each report. 

 The meeting is to be open for suggestions and recommendations from individual believers to the Local Spiritual Assembly on any matter affecting the Cause. Such recommendations must be adopted by majority vote of the community members present before constituting a resolution to be considered by the 

Local Spiritual  Assembly.

 Through this means individual Baha find in the Nineteen-Day Feast the channel through which to make suggestions and recommendations  to the 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 These recommendations are offered first to the local community, and when adopted by the community come before the Local Assembly, which then may in its discretion forward the recommendations  to the National Spiritual Assembly accompanied by its own considered view. 

 Upon each member of the community lies the obligation to make his or her utmost contribution  to the consultation, the ideal being a gathering of Baha'is inspired with one spirit and concentrating upon the one aim to further the interests of the Faith. 

 Baha'i visitors attending a Feast do not take part in the consultation of the community unless invited to do so. The secretary of the Assembly records each resolution adopted by the community, as well as the various suggestions advanced during the meeting, in order to report these to the Spiritual Assembly for its consideration. 

 Whatever action the Assembly takes is to be reported at a later Nineteen-Day 

Feast.                     

 It should be borne in mind that the consultation period of the Nineteen-Day Feast is not the time for the Local Spiritual Assembly to consult and make decisions. 

 Matters of a personal nature should be brought to the Spiritual Assembly and not to the community at the Nineteen-Day Feast. Concerning the attitude with which believers should come to these Feasts, the Master has said, "You must free yourselves from everything  that is in your hearts, before you enter." 
                           
       CONSULTATION               

 "In this Cause, consultation is of vital importance; but spiritual conference and not the mere voicing of personal views is intended. 

 Antagonism and contradiction are unfortunate and always destructive of truth. 

 The purpose is to emphasize the statement that consultation must have for its object the investigation of truth. 

 He who expresses an opinion should not voice it as correct and right but set it forth as a contribution to the consensus of opinion; for the light of reality becomes apparent when two opinions coincide..." 
P.U.P., pp. 6869.         

 "The principle of consultation, which constitutes  one of the basic laws of the Administration,  should be applied to all Baha'i activities which affect the collective interests of the Faith for it is though cooperation and continued exchange of thoughts and views that the Cause can best safeguard and foster its interests. 

 Individual  initiative, personal ability and resourcefulness,  though indispensable, are, unless supported  and enriched by the collective experience and wisdom of the group, utterly incapable of achieving such a tremendous task." 

 Shoghi Effendi, Bahci'iNews, Nov. 1933. 

 "Shoghi Effendi firmly believes that consultation must be maintained between the NSA and the entire body of the believers, and that such consultation, while the Convention is not in session, can best be maintained through the agency of the Local Assemblies, one of whose essential functions is to act as intermediaries between the local communities and their

 The main purpose of the Nineteen-Day Feasts is to enable individual believers to offer any suggestion to the Local Assembly which in its turn will pass it to the NSA. The Local Assembly is, therefore, the proper medium through which local Baha'i communities can communicate with the body of the national representatives." Letter on behalf  of Shoghi Effendi, Nov. 18, 1933. 

 "Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the principle of the undoubted right of the individual to self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his views. 

 "Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not dictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spfrit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of the spirit of a true Baha'i can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the right of the individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand, and fellowship, candor, and courage on the other." 
BA., pp. 63 — 64.            
                           
  DECISIONS AND APPEALS      

 At this crucial stage in the history of our Faith it seems advisable to emphasize to each Local Assembly an important principle of administration which has been too frequently overlooked. 

 This principle establishes the National Assembly as the court of appeal from decisions of Local Assemblies when protested by one or more members of the community as unjust or as not conforming to the actual facts. 

 A court of appeal is not responsible for determining the facts but oniy for reviewing the local decision based upon the facts assembled by the Local Assembly itself. On receiving an appeal the National Spiritual Assembly will send a copy of it to the Local Assembly and request its opinion. When this is received the case will be studied in the light of the facts presented to the National Assembly and a final decision made. The National Assembly can decide only upon the facts presented to it; therefore, when a matter is submitted to it, all obtainable facts, together with supporting documentary evidence  should be included. 

The National Assembly's   

 decision, whether approving or disapproving  the original decision of the Local Assembly, will be communicated to both the Local Assembly and to the person or persons who made the appeal. 

 This procedure is in accordance with both the national and local ByLaws. 

 Any complaint received by the National Assembly from a member or members of a local community who have not first submitted their complaint to the Local Assembly will be returned  to those making the protest, with a copy of the letter being sent to the Local Assembly for its information. In such a case the Local Assembly is to call the person or persons in for consultation and act upon the complaint. 

 An essential function of the Local Spiritual Assembly is the maintenance of unity and devotion  among the believers. As "Trustees of the Merciful" the Spiritual Assembly must be selfless and impartial, considerate of the rights of the individual, but firm and steadfast in upholding  the vital truths of the Revelation and obedience to its institutions. 

 Therefore, they must discriminate between situations which are transient and trivial and those which threaten to disrupt the community. 

 A distinction is to be made between personalities who cause disturbances because they lack grounding in the basic Teachings and attitudes of the Baha'i life, and those who deliberately cause trouble because in their hearts they do not accept the principle of authority as vested in the Manifestation, or in the institutions of the Baha'i World Community. 

 The Local Assembly is responsible for dealing with all local problems, but can call upon the 

National Spiritual Assembly
for advice if necessary.   

 The National Assembly, in any case involving two or more local communities, however, acts directly and deals with the problems as the court of original jurisdiction, since no Local Assembly has authority outside its own civil area. 

 "The authority of the NSA is undivided and unchallengeable in all matters pertaining to the administration of the Faith throughout the United States, therefore, the obedience of individual Baha'is, delegates, groups and Assemblies to that authority is imperative and should be wholehearted and unqualified. He is convinced that the unreserved acceptance and complete application of this vital provision of the Administration is essential to the main

 tenance of the highest degree of unity among the believers, and is indispensable to the effective  working of the administrative machinery of the Faith in every country." Letter from Shoghi Effendi through his secretary, Baha'i News, 

July 1934.                 
                           
     THE BAHA'I FUND           

 "As the progress and extension of spiritual activities is dependent and conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that immediately after the establishment of Local as well as National Spiritual Assemblies, a Baha Fund be established, to be placed under the exclusive control of the Spiritual Assembly. All donations and contributions should be offered to the treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of promoting the interests of the Cause, throughout that locality or country. It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of Baha'u'llah who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely and generously for the increase of that Fund. The members of the Spiritual Assembly will at their own discretion expend it to promote the Teaching Campaign, to help the needy, to establish educational Baha'i institutions, to extend in every way possible their sphere of service. I cherish the hope that all the friends, realizing the necessity of this measure will bestir themselves and contribute, however modestly at first, towards the speedy establishment and the increase of that Fund " B A ,pp.4l — 42. 

 "We must be like the fountain or spring that is continually emptying itself of all that it has and is continually being refilled from an invisible  source. To be continually giving out for the good of our fellows undeterred by the fear of poverty and reliant on the unfailing bounty of the Source of all wealth and all good — this is the secret of right living." 

 Shoghi Effendi, Balid'iNews, Sept. 1926. 

 "As the activities of the American Baha'i community expand, and its worldwide prestige correspondingly increases, the institution of the National Fund, the bedrock on which all other institutions must necessarily rest and be established, acquires added importance, and should be increasingly supported by the entire body of the believers, both in their individual capacities, and through their collective efforts, whether organized as groups or as Local Assemblies. 

 The supply of funds, in support of the National Treasury, constitutes, at the present  time, the lifeblood of these nascent institutions you are laboring to erect. 

 Its importance cannot, surely, be overestimated. 

 Untold blessings shall no doubt crown every effort directed to that end." MA., p. 5. 

 "In connection with the institution of the National Fund... I feel urged to remind you of the necessity of ever bearing in mind the cardinal  principle that all contributions to the Fund are to be purely and strictly voluntary in character..." B.A., p. 101. 

 "Moreover, we should, I feel, regard it as an axiom and guiding principle of Baha'i administration that in the conduct of every specific Baha activity, as different from undertakings of a humanitarian, philanthropic, or charitable character, which may in future be conducted under Baha'i auspices, oniy those who have already identified themselves with the Faith and are regarded as its avowed and unreserved supporters should be invited to join and colla —  borate." 
B.A., p. 182.

THE NONPOLITICAL CHARACTER

                 OF THE BAHA'I FAITH

  THE Baha principles clearly define and explain the nonpolitical character of the Faith, and serve as a guide for conduct in the relations of Baha with one another, with their fellow men, and in their relations with different departments of the civil government. 

 A brief summary  of excerpts from the Baha'i Writings will show that nonparticipation in political affairs is one of the basic axioms of Baha'i action. 

 The keynote to this theme may be found in the Writings of Baha'u'llah. 1-Je has stated: "That one is indeed a man who, today, dedi-cateth himself to the service of the entire human race. 

 The Great Being saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. In another passage He hath proclaimed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."1 "Sow not the seeds of discord among men, and refrain from contending with your neighbor... 

 Open, 0 people, the city of the human heart with the key of your utterance. 

 "That which beseemeth you is the love of God, and the love of Him Who is the Manifestation of His Essence, and the observance of whatsoever He chooseth to prescribe unto you, did ye but know it. "Say: Let truthfulness and courtesy be your adorning. 

 Suffer not yourselves to be deprived of the robe of forbearance and justice, that the sweet savors of holiness may be wafted from your hearts upon all created things. 

 Say: Beware,  0 people of Baha, lest ye walk in the ways of them whose words differ from their deeds. Strive that ye may be enabled to manifest to the peoples of the earth the signs of God, and to mirror forth His commandments. Let your acts be a guide unto all mankind, for the professions  of most men, be they high or low, differ from their conduct. It is through your deeds Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 250. 

 that ye can distinguish yourselves from others. Through them the brightness of your light can be shed upon the whole earth.. 

 The aim of the Faith is to produce the reality of virtue in souls and evolve institutions capable of dealing with social matters justly, in the light of the revealed truths. 

 This is entirely distinct from the province filled by partisan civil institutions. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha counselled the Baha'is from the early beginnings of the American Baha'i community not to discuss political affairs :2 .... All conferences (i.e., all consultation and discussion) must be regarding the matters of benefit, both as a whole and individually, such as the guarding of all in all cases, their protection  and preservation, the improvement of character, the training of children, etc. "If any person wishes to speak of government affairs, or to interfere with the order of government, the others must not combine with him because the Cause of God is withdrawn entirely from political affairs; the political realm pertains only to the Rulers of those matters; it has nothing to do with the souls who are exerting their utmost energy to harmonizing affairs, helping character and inciting (the people) to strive for perfections. Therefore no soul is allowed to interfere with (political) matters,  but only in that which is commanded." 

 With the development of a worldwide administrative structure within the Baha'i Faith, institutions have been set up in national and local areas which assure the unity and integrity of the Faith. 

 In unfolding these administrative institutions Shoghi Effendi has reiterated the importance of the nonpolitical character of the Baha'i teachings in a letter written March 21, 1932, to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada :~ "I feel it, therefore, incumbent upon me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance ibid.. pp.303 — 305.

 of an instruction which, at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or to the West. 

 And this principle is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities  or collectively as Local or National Assemblies,  in any form of activity that might be interpreted,  either directly or indirectly, as an interference  in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 Whether it be in the publications which they initiate and supervise; or in their official and public deliberations; or in the posts they occupy and the services they render; or in the communications they address to their fellow-disciples; or in their dealings with men of eminence and authority; or in their affiliations  with kindred societies and organizations, it is, I am firmly convinced, their first and sacred obligation to abstain from any word or deed that might be construed as a violation of this vital principle. 

 Theirs is the duty to demonstrate,  on one hand, their unqualified loyalty and obedience to whatever is the considered judgment of their respective governments. 

 "Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective nations, with the policies of their governments and the schemes and programmes of parties and factions. 

 In such controversies they should assign no blame, take no side, further no design, and identify themselves with no system prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide Fellowship  which it is their aim to guard and foster. Let them beware lest they allow themselves to become the tools of unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious among their countrymen. 

 Let them so shape their lives and regulate their conduct that no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery or of intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought against them. Let them rise above all particularism and partisanship,  above the vain disputes, the petty calculations,  the transient passions that agitate the face, and engage the attention, of a changing world. It is their duty to strive to distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts and functions as are either diplomatic or political from those that are purely administra tive in character, and which under no circumstances are affected by the changes and chances that political activities and party government, in every land, must necessarily involve. 

 Let them affirm their unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God's immutable  Purpose for all men. 

 "It should be made unmistakably clear that such an attitude implies neither the slightest indifference to the cause and interests of their own country, nor involves any insubordination on their part to the authority of recognized and established governments. Nor does it constitute a repudiation of their sacred obligation to promote,  in the most effective manner, the best interests of their government and people. 

 It indicates the desire cherished by every true and loyal follower of Baha'u'llah to serve, in an unselfish, unostentatious and patriotic fashion, the highest interests of the country to which he belongs, and in a way that would entail no departure from the high standards of integrity and truthfulness associated with the teachings of his Faith. 

 "As the number of the Baha'i communities in various parts of the world multiplies and their power, as a social force, becomes increasingly apparent, they will no doubt find themselves increasingly subjected to the pressure which men of authority and influence, in the political domain,  will exercise in the hope of obtaining the support they require for the advancement of their aims. 

 These communities will, moreover, feel a growing need of the goodwill and the assistance of their respective governments in their efforts to widen the scope, and to consolidate the foundations, of the institutions committed to their charge. Let them beware lest, in their eagerness to further the aims of their beloved Cause, they should be led unwittingly to bargain with their Faith, to compromise with their essential principles, or to sacrifice, in return for any material advantage which their institutions may derive, the integrity of their spiritual ideals. 

 Let them proclaim that in whatever  country they reside, and however advanced their institutions, or profound their desire to enforce the laws and apply the principles, enunciated by Baha'u'llah, they will, unhesitat

  ingly, subordinate the operation of such laws and the application of such principles to the requirements and legal enactments of their respective governments. 

 Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country's constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries. 

 "It should also be borne in mind that the very extension of the activities in which we are engaged, and the variety of the communities which labour under divers forms of government, so essentially different in their standards, policies,  and methods, make it absolutely essential for all those who are the declared members of any one of these communities to avoid any action that might, by arousing the suspicion or exciting the antagonism of any one government,  involve their brethren in fresh persecutions  or complicate the nature of their task. How else, might I ask, could such a far-flung Faith, which transcends political and social boundaries, which includes within its pale so great a variety of races and nations, which will have to rely increasingly, as it forges ahead, on the goodwill and support of the diversified and contending governments of the earth — how else could such a Faith succeed in preserving its unity, in safeguarding its interests, and in ensuring the steady and peaceful development of its institutions? 

 "Such an attitude, however, is not dictated by considerations of selfish expediency, but is actuated, first and foremost, by the broad principle that the followers of Baha'u'llah will, under no circumstances, suffer themselves to be involved, whether as individuals or in their collective capacities, in matters that would entail  the slightest departure from the fundamental  verities and ideals of their Faith. 

 Neither the charges which the uninformed and the malicious  may be led to bring against them, nor the allurernents of honours and rewards, will ever induce them to surrender their trust or to deviate from their path. Let their words proclaim,  and their conduct testify, that they who follow Baha'u'llah, in whatever land they reside,  are actuated by no selfish ambition, that they neither thirst for power, nor mind any wave of unpopularity, of distrust or criticism, which a strict adherence to their standards might provoke." 

     And again: "The Baha      

 Faith as it forges ahead throughout the western world and particularly in lands where the political machinery  is corrupt and political passions and prejudices  are dominant among the masses, should increasingly assert and demonstrate the fact that it is nonpolitical in character, that it stands above party, that it is neither apathetic to national interests nor opposed to any party or faction, and that it seeks through administrative channels, rather than through diplomatic  and political posts to establish, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the capacity, the sane patriotism, the integrity and highmindedness of its avowed adherents. 

 This is the general and vital principle; it is for the National representatives to apply it with fidelity and vigor."' These instructions raised the question whether Baha'is should vote in any public election. 
A Tablet revealed by       

'Abdu'l-Baha to Mr. Thornton

 Coase was sent to the Guardian, and the following reply was received, dated January26, 1933 :2 "The Guardian fully recognizes the authenticity  and controlling influence of this instruction  from 'Abdu'l-Baha upon the question. He, however, feels under the responsibility of stating  that the attitude taken by the Master (that is, that American citizens are in duty bound to vote in public elections) implies certain reservations. 

 He, therefore, lays it upon the individual conscience to see that in following the Master's instructions no Baha'i vote for an officer nor Baha participation in the affairs of the Republic  shall involve acceptance by that individual of a program or policy that contravenes any vital principle, spiritual or social, of the Faith." The Guardian added to this letter the following postscript: "I feel it incumbent upon me to clarify the above statement, written in my behalf, by stating that no vote cast, or office undertaken, by a Baha'i should necessarily constitute acceptance, by the voter or office holder, of the entire program of any political party. No Baha can be regarded as either a Republican or Democrat, as such. He is, above all else, the supporter of the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, with which, I am firmly convinced, the program of no political party is completely harmonious."

 In a letter dated March 16, 1933, the Guardian sent these further details:' "As regards the nonpolitical character of the Baha'i 

Faith, Shoghi Effendi     

 feels that there is no contradiction whatsoever between the Tablet (to Thornton Chase, referred to above) and the reservations to which he has referred. The Master surely never desired the friends to use their influence towards the realization and promotion of policies contrary to any of the principles of the Faith. The friends may vote, if they can do it, without identifying themselves with one party or another. To enter the arena of party politics is surely detrimegtal to the best interests of the Faith and will harm the Cause. It remains for the individuals to so use their right to vote as to keep aloof from party politics, and always bear in mind that they are voting on the merits of the individual, rather than because he belongs to one party or another.  The matter must be made perfectly clear to the individuals, who will be left free to exercise  their discretion and judgment. But if a certain  person does enter into party politics and labours for the ascendancy of one party over another, and continues to do it against the expressed appeals, and warnings of the Assembly, then the Assembly has the right to refuse him the right to vote in Baha'i elections." 

 That this principle, as do all Baha'i principles, has worldwide application is made clear by Shoghi Effendi in a letter dated March 11, 1936 :2 

    "The Faith of Baha'u'llah 

 has assimilated, by virtue of its creative, its regulative and ennobling energies, the varied races, nationalities, creeds and classes that have sought its shadow, and have pledged unswerving fealty to its cause. It has changed the hearts of its adherents, burned away their prejudices, stilled their passions, exalted their conceptions, ennobled their motives, coordinated their efforts, and transformed  their outlook. While preserving their patriotism and safeguarding their lesser loyalties, it has made them lovers of mankind, and the determined upholders of its best and truest interests. 

 While maintaining intact their belief in the Divine origin of their respective religions, it has enabled them to visualize the underlying purpose of these religions, to discover their merits, to recognize their sequence, their inter-'Ba/id'!

 dependence, their wholeness and unity and to acknowledge the bond that vitally links them to itself. 

 This universal, this transcending love which the followers of the Baha'i Faith feel for their fellowmen, of whatever race, creed, class or nation, is neither mysterious nor can it be said to have been artificially stimulated. It is both spontaneous and genuine. 

 They whose hearts are warmed by the energizing influence of God's creative love cherish His creatures for His sake, and recognize in every human face a sign of His reflected glory. 

 "Of such men and women it may be truly said that to them 'every foreign land is a fatherland, and every fatherland a foreign land.' For their citizenship, it must be remembered, is in the 

Kingdom of Baha'u'llah.    

 Though willing to share to the utmost the temporal benefits and the fleeting joys which this earthly life can confer,  though eager to participate in whatever activity that conduces to the richness, the happiness  and peace of that life, they can, at no time, forget that it constitutes no more than a transient, a very brief stage of their existence, that they who live it are but pilgrims and wayfarers  whose goal is the Celestial City, and whose home the Country of never-failing joy and brightness. 

 "Though loyal to their respective governments, though profoundly interested in anything  that affects their security and welfare, though anxious to share in whatever promotes their best interests, the Faith with which the followers of Baha'u'llah stand identified is one which they firmly believe God has raised high above the storms, the divisions, and controversies  of the political arena. 

 Their Faith they conceive to be essentially nonpolitical, supranational  in character, rigidly nonpartisan, and entirely dissociated from nationalistic ambi-dons, pursuits, and purposes. 

 Such a Faith knows no division of class or of party. It subordinates, without hesitation or equivocation, every particularistic interest, be it personal, regional, or national to the paramount interests of humanity, firmly convinced that in a world of interdependent peoples and nations the advantage  of the part is best to be reached by the advantage of the whole, and that no abiding benefit can be conferred upon the component parts if the general interests of the entity itself are ignored or neglected." 

 The unity of I3aM'i action throughout the

NONPOLITICAL CHARACTER OF THE BAHA' I FAITH                        537

 world is further emphasized in a letter from Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Vienna, written  in 1947 through his secretary, in which he said in part :1 "We Baha'is are one the world over; we are seeking to build up a new world order, divine in origin. 

 How can we do this if every Baha is a member of a different political party — some of them diametrically opposite to each other? Where is our unity then? We would be divided because of politics, against ourselves and this is the opposite of our purpose. 

 Obviously if one Baha'i in Austria is given freedom to choose a political party and join it, however good its aims may be, another Baha'i in Japan or America, or India, has the right to do the same thing and he might belong to a party the very opposite in principle to that which the Austrian Baha'i belongs to. Where would be the unity of the Faith then? These two spiritual brothers would be working against each other because of their political affiliations (as the Christians of Europe have been doing in so manyfratricidaiwars). 

 The best wayfor aBahA'i to serve his country and the world is to work for the establishment of Baha'u'llah's World Order, which will gradually unite all men and do away with divisive political systems and religious creeds. 

 In the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha the Baha'is are instructed to "obey and be the well-wishers of the governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king as disloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government a transgression of the Cause of God."2 In explanation of this statement the Guardian wrote, in a letter dated July 3, 1948 :~ "Regarding your question about politics and the Master's Will: the attitude of the Baha must be twofold, complete obedience to the government of the country they reside in, and no interference whatsoever in political matters or questions. What the Master's statement really means is obedience to a duly constituted government, whatever that government may be in form. We are not the ones, as individual Baha'is, to judge our government as just or unjust — for each believer would be sure to hold a different viewpoint, and within our own Baha'i fold a hotbed of dissension would spring up and destroy our unity. We must buildup our 1 BabdiNews, April, 1949.

 Baha'i system, and leave the faulty systems of the world to go their way. 

 We cannot change them through becoming involved in them; on the contrary, they will destroy us." Another application of this principle concerns the right, propriety or usefulness of exerting Baha'i influence for the enactment of legislative measures reflecting more or less the purpose  of some Baha'i principle or teaching. For example, should a Baha'i community, local or national, lend the name of the Baha Faith to support legislation which seeks to abolish race and religious discrimination in matters of industrial employment, or intervene when measures  concerning military training of youth are before a legislature? 

    The National Spiritual     

 Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States has stated' that, ''as a general policy subject to the Guardian's specific direction in special cases, Baha'is and their administrative institutions should not feel obligated to adopt a 'Baha'i' attitude or course of action on matters of civil legislation. 

 Our teachings and basic principles speak for themselves.  These we can always declare and set forth with all possible energy whenever occasions arise. But a truth which is sundered from its sustaining spiritual Source, lifted out of its organic relationship to the Baha community, broken off from the other truths, and made subject  to the storm and stress of secular controversy,  is no longer a truth with which we can usefully have concern. 

 It has become an enactment to be carried out by institutions and groups committed to other enactments, other aims and purposes and methods not in conformity with the 'Divine Polity' entrusted to those alone who give full loyalty to Baha'u'llah. Far better for us to strive to mirror forth radiantly the individual and community virtues of anew era than to hope others than believers will achieve the holy mission of the Faith. 

 We Baha'is have in reality accepted a world order and not merely a new decalogue of truths or commands. 

 On the other hand, obedience to civil government is an obligation laid by Baha'u'llah upon every Baha'i" Shoghi Effendi2 points out, as a guiding principle of Baha conduct, that "in connection  with their administrative activities, no matter how grievously interference with them 1 The Baha'i World, vol. x, p.278.

 might affect the course of the extension of the Movement, and the suspension of which does not constitute in itself a departure from the principle of loyalty to their Faith, the considered  judgment and authoritative decrees issued by their responsible rulers must, if they be faithful to Baha'u'llah's and 'Abdu'l-Baha's express injunctions, be thoroughly respected and loyally obeyed. In matters, however, that vitally affect the integrity and honor of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and are tantamount to a recantation of their faith and repudiation of their innermost belief, they [the Baha'is are convinced, and are unhesitatingly prepared to vindicate by their lifeblood the sincerity of their conviction, that no power on earth, neither the arts of the most insidious adversary nor the bloody weapons of the most tyrannical oppressor,  can ever succeed in extorting from them a 539 word or deed that might tend to stifle the voice of their conscience or tarnish the purity of their faith." 

 "Small wonder if by the Pen of Baha'u'llah these pregnant words, written in anticipation of the present state of mankind, should have been revealed: 'It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.' 

 And again, 'That one indeed is a man who today dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race.'

            BAHA'IS AND MILITARY SERVICE

            THE BAnk'! VIEW OF PACIFISM

  IN a letter published in Bahd'iNews, January, 1938, 

Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian

 of the Baha'i Faith wrote through his secretary: "With reference to the absolute pacifists or conscientious objectors to war: their attitude, judged from the Baha'i standpoint, is quite antisocial and due to its exahation of the individual  conscience leads inevitably to disorder and chaos in society. Extreme pacifists are thus very close to anarchists, in the sense that both of these groups lay an undue emphasis on the rights and merits of the individual. 

 The Baha'i conception of social life is essentially based on the subordination of the individual will to that of society. It neither suppresses the individual nor does it exalt him to the point of making him an antisocial creature, a menace to society. As in everything, it follows the 'golden mean.' The oniy way society can function is for the minority to follow the will of the majority. 

 "The other main objection to the conscientious objectors is that their method of establishing peace is too negative. 

 Noncooperation is too passive a philosophy to become an effective way for social reconstruction. 

 Their refusal to bear arms can never establish peace. There should first be a spiritual revitalization which nothing, except the Cause of God, can effectively  bring to every man's heart." 
                          
      THE BAHA'I POSITION ON MILITARY SERVICE

  (A Public Statement issued by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States) In view of the increasing importance of a clear understanding of the details of the Baha position on military service, the National Baha'i Assembly presents the following statement  of general principles for the information and guidance of the members of the Baha'i Community in the United States and others who may have an interest in the Bali viewpoint. 

 The Baha teachings require that followers of the Faith obey the laws of the government under which they live, and this requirement includes the obligation for military service which tests upon all citizens. However, Baha'is are also required to apply for noncombatant service whenever the opportunity to do so is legally provided by their government on the basis of religious training and belief. 

 While the religious convictions of Baha'is require them to seek whatever exemption from combatant duty may be granted by their government on the grounds of religious belief', they definitely are not pacifists in the sense of refusal to cooperate with and obey the laws of an established government. 

 Thus Baha'is do not, on the grounds of religious conviction, seek to abandon their obligation as citizens in time of war or national emergency. Neither do they attempt to avoid the dangers and hardships which are inevitable in time of war, and to which all citizens of military age are liable. 

 Thus Baha who are citizens of the United States are able to reconcile their fundamental spiritual convictions and their civil obligations as citizens by applying for noncombatant service  under the existing Selective Service law and regulations. 

 The members of the Baha Faith make no reservations in claiming that they are fully obedient to all provisions of the laws of their country, including the constitutional right of the Federal government to raise armies and conscript citizens for military service.

SUMMARY OF THE GUARDIAN'S INSTRUCTIONS ON THE OBLIGATION
  OF BAT{A'IS IN CONNECTION WITH MILITARY SERVICE

  During World War II the Baha'i position on military training and service, and the obligation  of individual Baha to apply for and maintain a noncombatant status when this is possible under the laws of their country, were outlined specifically in a series of instructions and bulletins issued by the National 

Assembly.                

 Since 1945, two items on this subject have been published in Baha'i News; one in the October, 1946 issue (pp. 9 — 10), and the other in the September, 1948 issue (p. 6). Both of these articles quoted the Guardian's instruction contained  in a letter to the National Assembly dated July 20, 1946, written in reply to a question as to whether the existence of the United Nations in its present form should change the attitude of Baha'is toward military duties which might require the taking of human life. 

 The Guardian's answer to this question is again quoted below: "As there is neither an 

International Police Force

 nor any immediate prospect of one corn-hag  into being, the Baha should continue to apply, under all circumstances, for exemption from any military duties that necessitate the taking of life. There is no justification for any change of attitude on our part at the present time." 

 These words indicate that the Guardian still felt that a Baha cannot voluntarily enter any form of combatant military duty, and must seek exemption from such service if this is possible under the laws of his country. 

 The instruction given in the July 20, 1946 letter was confirmed once again in a cable received  from the Guardian by the National Assembly on January 17, 1951. 

 The Guardian, in these and earlier communications, has made it clear that it is obligatory, and not an optional matter, for all Baha to apply for and maintain a noncombatant status if this is possible under the law. When such a law exists, as is the case in the United States, Baha cannot voluntarily enlist in any branch of the armed forces where they would be subject  to orders to engage in the taking of human life.

  i. LOYALTY TO GOVERNMENT Statement Prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly of the BaIzci'z's of the United States of America WHEN a great social crisis sweeps through a civilization, moral values become impaired. 

 In the crisis of our own time, members of the Baha'i Faith go on record as firmly upholding the principle of loyalty to government. 

 Baha'u'llah Himself set forth this cardinal principle: 'tin every country or government where any of this community reside, they must behave toward that government with faithfulness,  trustfulness, and truthfulness." 

 Loyalty to government, in the Baha'i view, is an essential spiritual and social principle. "We must obey and be the well-wishers of the government of the land..." "The essence of the Baha spirit is that in order to establish a better social order and economic condition, there must be allegiance to the laws and principles of government." 

 This allegiance is part of the strong emphasis on integrity of character found in the Baha'i teaching. 

 "Let integrity and uprightness distinguish  all thine acts." "Beautify your tongues, o people, with truthfulness, and adorn your souls with the ornament of honesty. Beware, o people, that ye deal not treacherously with any one. Be ye the trustees of God amongst His creatures, and the emblems of His generosity  amidst His people." 

 Without integrity of character in its citizens and without loyalty to government, a nation will find itself torn asunder and unable to function as an organic society. Not oniy do the Baha'i teachings obligate members to be loyal to their government — they also specifically  forbid them from taking any part in subversive  political and social movements.

           BAHA'I CALENDAR, FESTIVALS AND

           DATES OF HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE

  i. FOREWORD By DR. J. E. ESSLEMONT 

         From Baha'u'llah and the New Era

  AMONGdifferentpeoplesandatdifferent times many different methods have been adopted  for the measurement of time and fixing of dates, and several different calendars are still in daily use, e.g., the Gregorian in 

Wes~em Europe, the Julian  
in many countries of       

Eastern Europe, the Hebrew 

 among the Jews, and the Muhammadan in Muslim countries. 

 The DAb signalized the importance of the dispensation which lie came to herald, by inaugurating  a new calendar. In this, as in the Gregorian Calendar, the lunar month is abandoned and the solar year is adopted. 

 The Baha'i year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e., 361 days), with the addition of certain "intercalary days" (four in ordinary and five in leap years) between the eighteenth and nineteenth months in order to adjust the calendar to the solar year. The Bab named the months after the attributes of God. The Baha'i New Year, like the ancient Persian New Year, is astronomically fixed, commencing at the March equinox (March 21), and the Baha'i era commences with the year of the flAb's declaration  (i.e., 1844 A.D., 1260 A.H.). In the not far distant future it will be necessary that all peoples in the world agree on a common calendar. 

 It seems, therefore, fitting that the new age of unity should have a new calendar free from the objections and associations which make each of the older calendars unacceptable to large sections of the world's population, and it is difficult to see how any other arrangement could exceed in simplicity and convenience that proposed by the Bab.

       ~. BAHA HOLY DAYS ON WHICH WORK SHOULD
                    BE SUSPENDED

 The first day of Riglv&n, The ninth day of RPjvAn, The twelfth day of RhJv~n, The anniversary of the declaration of the Bab, The anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah, The anniversary of the birth of the flAb, The anniversary of the ascension of Baha'u'llah, The anniversary of the martyrdom of the Bab, The feast of Nawruz. 

  NOTE:    'Abdu'l-Baha, in one of His Tablets addressed to a believer of Nayriz, Persia, has written the following: "Nine days in the year have been appointed on which work is forbidden. 

 Some of these days have been specifically mentioned in the Book. The rest follow as corollaries to the Text. Work on the Day of the Covenant (F&te Day of 'Abdu'l-Baha), however, is not prohibited. Celebration of that day is left to the discretion of the friends. 

 Its observation is not obligatory. The days pertaining to the Abh& Beauty (Baha'u'llah) and the Primal Point (the DAb), that is to say these nine days, are the oniy ones on which work connected with trade, commerce, industry and agriculture is not allowed. In like manner, work connected with any form of employment, whether governmental or otherwise, wise, should be suspended." 

  As a corollary of this Tablet it follows that the anniversaries of the birth and ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha are not to be regarded as days on which work is prohibited. The celebration ration of these two days, however, is obligatory. 

  Baha'is in East and West, holding administrative positions, whether public or private, should exert the utmost effort to obtain special leave from their superiors to enable them to observe these nine holy days. 

     4. ADDITIONAL MATERIAL GLEANED FROM NABIL'S
         NARRATIVE (VOL. II), REGARDING THE

                   BAHA'I CALENDAR

     The Badi' Calendar (Baha'i 

 Calendar) has been taken by me from the Kitab-i-Aqdas', one of the works written by the Bab. As I have observed in these days that certain believers are inclined to regard the year in which Baha'u'llah departed from BaghdAd to Constantinople as marking the beginning of the Badi' Calendar, I have requested Mirza AqA JAn, the amanuensis of Baha'u'llah, to ascertain His will and desire concerning this matter. Baha'u'llah answered and said: "The year sixty A.H. (1844 A.D.), the year of the Declaration of the BTh, must be regarded as the beginning of the Badi' Calendar." 

 The Declaration of the 13Th took place on the evening preceding the fifth day of Jam6xlfy-u'1-Avval, of the year 1260 AM. 

 It has been ordained that the solar calendar be fob lowed, and that the vernal Equinox, the day of Naw-Rtiz, be regarded as the New Year's Day of the Badi' Calendar. The year sixty, in which the fifth day of Jam6Aiyu'1-Avval coincided with the sixty-fifth day after Nawruz, has accordingly  been regarded as the first year of the Badi' Calendar. As in that year, the day of Naw-Riiz,

  the vernal Equinox, preceded by sixty-six days the date of the Declaration of the Bab, I have therefore, throughout my history, regarded the Naw-Rtiz of the year sixty-one A.H. (the Naw-Ritz  immediately following the Declaration of the B&b) as the first Naw-RCxz of the Badi' Calendar. 

 I have accordingly considered the Naw-Rfiz of this present year, the year 1306 Afi., 

 which is the 47th solar year after the Declaration of the BTh, as the 46th Naw-Riiz of the Badi' 

Calendar.

 AyyAm-i-HA (Intercalary Days) February 26 to March 1 inclusive — four in ordinary and five in leap years. 

 The first day of each month is thus the day of   sisting of 19 months of 19 days each, with the Baha, and the last day of each month the day  addition of certain intercalary days. He has of 'Au'.named the New Year's Day, which is the day The ETh has regarded the solar year, of 365 of Naw-Rfiz, the day of Bah~, of the month of days, 5 hours, and fifty odd minutes, as con-BahA. ahA. He has ordained the month of 'Ah' to be


<p550>
550                  the month of fasting, and has decreed that the day of Naw-Rttz should mark the termination of that period. As the Bab did not specifically define the place for the four days and the fraction of a day in the Badi' Calendar, the people of the Baydn were at a loss as to how they should regard them. The revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas  in the city of 'Akka resolved this problem and settled the issue. Baha'u'llah designated those days as the "Ayy~m-i-H~" and ordained that they should immediately precede the month of 'AlA', which is the month of fasting. He enjoined upon His followers to devote these days to feasting, rejoicing, and charity. 

 Immediately  upon the termination of these intercalary days, Baha'u'llah ordained the month of fasting to begin. I have heard it stated that some of the people of the Baydn, the followers of Mirza YaliyA, have regarded these intercalary days as coming immediately after the month of 'Ah', thus terminating their fast five days before the day of Naw-Rtiz. This, notwithstanding the explicit text of the Baydn which states that the day of Nawruz must needs be the first day of the month of Bah&, and must follow immediately after the last day of the month of 'MA'. Others, aware of this contradiction, have started  their fasting on the fifth day of the month of 'ALA', and included the intercalary days within the period of fasting. 

 Every fourth year the number of the intercalary days is raised from four to five. The day of Nawruz falls on the 21St of March only if the vernal Equinox precedes the setting of the sun on that day. Should the vernal Equinox take place after sunset, Naw-Rfiz will have to be celebrated on the following day. 

 The Bab has, moreover, in His writings, revealed in the Arabic tongue, divided the years following the date of His Revelation, into cycles of nineteen years each. The names of the years in each cycle are as follows: 

1.  Alif                   
2.  BA'                    
3.  Ab

Most Luminous.             
Unity.                     

 Each cycle of nineteen years is called V6hid. Nineteen cycles constitute a period called Kull-i-  Shay'. 

 The numerical value of the word "VAbid" is nineteen, that of "Kull-i-Shay'" is 361. "Viliid" signifies unity, and is symbolic of the unity of God. 

 The Bab has, moreover, stated that this system of His is dependent upon the acceptance and good-pleasure of "Him Whom God shall make manifest." One word from Him would suffice either to establish it for all time, or to annul it forever. 

 For instance, the date of the 21st of April, 1930, which is the first day of Rht1v~n, and which according to the Kitab-i-Aqdas must coincide with the "thirteenth day of the second Baha'i month," and which fell this year (1930) on Monday, would, according to the system of the Baha' Calendar, be described as follows: "The day of KamM, the day of Qudrat, of the month of Jalid, of the year Rabbi, of the fifth VAliid, of the first 

Kull-i-Shay'."

I bear witness, 0 my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. 
 There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the

Self-Subsisting.

Following is a shortselectionfromthefourhundred and nine languages and dialects into which Baha'i literature had been translated by RiQvAn (April 21st — May 2nd) 1968. A subsequent volume of The Baha'i Worldwill include thetext of this prayer in all the languages into which it will have been translated.

          2. GUIDE TO TRANSLITERATION AND
               PRONUNCIATION OF THE
                 PERSIAN ALPHABET

  %mm — u,    b (Y, _ (b~IOS ~Od a...asin     i.. .as(e)in u...as(o)in   aw...asin account          best            short           mown a...asin     i...as(ee)in (i.. .as(oo)in arm              meet             moon The "i" added to the name of a town signifies "belonging to." Thus Sbfr~izi means native of ~hfrAz. 

           3. NOTES ON THE PRONUNCIATION
                 OF PERSIAN WORDS

  The emphasis in Persian words is more or less evenly distributed, each syllable being equally stressed as in French. For example, do not say Tabriz or Tabarsi: stay as long on one syllable as on the next; Tabriz; Tabarsi. (While there are many exceptions to this rule, it is the most generally correct method of treating the question  of stress.) 

 A frequent mistake is the failure to distinguish between broad and flat "a's." This differentiation makes the language especially musical and should be observed: in the word Mn~n, for example, pronounce the first "a" as in account, and the second syllable to rhyme with on. Americans are apt to pronounce short "a" plus "r" like the verb form are; this is a mistake; "ar" should be pronounced as in the word hurry — cf. Tarbfyat. 

 The same differentiation should be observed in the case of long and short "i" and long and short "u." As the guide to the transliteration indicates, short "i" is like "e" in best, and long "i" like "ee" in meet; for example, IbrAhim is pronounced 

Eb-r~heem; Is1~m is Ess-Iahm. Short

 "u" being like "o" in short, andlong "ii" like "oo" in moon, the following would be


<p579>
ORIENTAL TERMS               579
pronounced: Quddas — Qod-dooss;

B~rfur6~ja                 
 — BAr-foroosh.              

 Pronounce "aw" to rhyme with low, or mown; Naw-Rfiz is Now-Rooz. 

 The following consonants may be pronounced  like v dh z z, 41. 

 The following consonants may be pro-flounced  like ss' th s ~. Zli is pronounced like the "s" in pleasure. Ri is pronounced like "cli" in Scottish loch or German naclit. Do not pronounce it as "k." Westerners are as a rule incapable of pro-flouncing  "gli" and "q"; a gutteral French "r" will serve here; otherwise use hard "g" as in good. 

 H and b, approximately like the English aspirate "li", should never be dropped. Tihnin is Teh-ron; madrisih is mad-res-seh; 

Mirza is Meli-rob.        

 In the case of double letters pronounce each separately: 'Abbas. 

 The character transliterated (') represents a pause; it is not unlike the initial sound made in pronouncing such a word as every. 

 The word Baha is phonetically as follows: "a~~ as in account; "A" as in hail; ('), pause; "1" as ee in meet. 

 The character transliterated (') may also be treated as a pause. 

 N.B. As Persian often indicates no vowel sounds and as its pronunciation differs in different localities throughout Persia and the Near East as well as among individuals in any given locality, a uniform system of translitera-lion such as the above, which is in use by Baha communities all over the world, is indispensable to the student.

ARTICLES AND REVIEWS

  i. BAHA'U'LLAH by H. M. BAHA'I (The following passages are reprinted, with permission, from the book Baha'u'llah, by H. M. Baha'i. George Ronald, Oxford, 1963.) 

  "The humanitarian and spiritual principles enunciated decades ago in the darkest East by Baha'u'llah and moulded by Him into a coherent scheme are one after the other being taken by a world unconscious of their source as the marks ofprogres-sive sive civilization. And the sense that mankind has broken with the past and that the old guidance will not carry it through the emergencies of the present has filled with uncertainty and dismay all thoughtful men save those who have learned to find in the story of Baha'u'llah the meaning of all the prodigies andportents of our time." 

                                        Shoghi Effendi

  THE towering grandeur and the tender beauty of the life of a Manifestation of God cannot be comprehended by events usually associated with a saintly life. 

 The immensity of such a life presents itself in that mysterious influence which it exerts over countless lives, an influence which functions not through social status and prestige, wealth, secular power or worldly dominion; indeed not even through a medium of mere superior knowledge and intellectual  achievement. 

   The Manifestation of God   

 is the Archetype, and His life is the supreme pattern. His vision, not arrested by time and space, encompasses the future as well as the past. He is the only and the necessary link between one period of social evolution and another. 

 Without Him history is meaningless and coordination is impossible. Furthermore, the Manifestation of God releases deep reservoirs of spiritual power and quickens the forces latent in humanity. By Him, and by Him alone, can Man attain "second birth". 

  Mirza Ijusayn-'A1I, later surnamed Baha'u'llah, was born on November 12th, 1817, in TibrAn, the capital of Persia. 

His father, Mirza Buzurg   

 of Ndr, held a responsible post in the ministerial circle of the ShTh's court. All accounts  of Baha'u'llah's childhood indicate that from His earliest years He possessed remarkable and very unusual powers. At the age of seven, He appeared before the SMh, to argue a case on behalf of His father, and proved His suit, ills character endeared Him not only to His kinsmen and immediate entourage, but to strangers as well. 

 The minister was fully conscious of the extraordinary powers of his Son, although the destiny of the Child could not but be unknown to him. Baha'u'llah grew up in the environs of the court, amidst riches and great comfort. But when His father died, and the post left vacant in the court was offered to Him, lie refused to accept it. The Grand Vizier, we are told, said that Mirza ~usayn-'A1i was intended for a work of greater magnitude, and the arena of government was too small a field for His capacities. 

 In those days, the nobility of IrAn cared little for the sciences and the arts of the learned. Beyond excellent calligraphy, a knowledge of the sacred scriptures of IslAm, and a well-founded  acquaintance with the works of such prominent figures in Persian literature as Rflmi, Firdausi, Sa'di and Ij~fiz, they generally knew but little. There were notable exceptions of course. Baha'u'llah was more than an exception. 

Although untutored, He     

 plunged freely and naturally into such talks and discussions as were considered to be the domain of the theologian  and the scholar. 

 Time and again He astounded the doctors of religion and the learned of the land by His clear reasoning and irrefutable  logic. 

 Oftentimes a person encroaching upon precincts reserved to others becomes presumptuous, arrogant, and haughty. 

 Baha'u'llah  was modest, genial, and forbearing.

588                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 This youthful scion of a house of nobility had an overwhelming passion for justice. He deserted the court to tend the oppressed and the aggrieved. Not once did He hesitate to champion  the cause of the poor and the fallen who turned to Him for succour and help. None who deserved was refused. Thus passed the days of His Youth, until a day came when an emissary set out with a letter to seek Him, and the very qualities that made Him a haven and refuge, and raised Him in the esteem of His fellow men, convinced that emissary that the Son of the late minister from Ni2r was indeed the Exalted Person intended to receive the letter of the BTh. 

 On May 22nd, 1844, a young merchant of Shfr&, whose name was Siyyid 'Ali-Mubam-mad, revealed Himself to a seeker as that Deliverer Whom the world of IslAm anxiously awaited. An independent Manifestation of God and the Harbinger of a greater Manifestation, He took the title of the Rib, meaning "Gate". His primary mission was to awaken the slumbering  people of IrAn, and to warn the followers of the Faith of Mubammad — a Faith by then, alas, laden with abuses. The Bab sent MuIIA Ijusayn, that seeker who was the first to believe in Him, to the capital, and entrusted Him with a letter for an unnamed Person, supreme in heavenly rank. MuIIA IJusayn reached TibrAn, determined to let Providence guide his steps. He searched indomitably, but in vain. 

 At last a visitor came to him, whose hometown was N6r in MAzindarAn, the home of Baha'u'llah's family. 

 In the course of conversation MullA Ijusayn inquired about the sons of the late Mirza Buzurg, the minister from Nflr. Thus he heard of Mirza Ijusayn-'Ali, and eagerly asked for more information. And when the full story was unfolded to him, he knew in an instant that he had found the unnamed Person Who was to receive the letter sent by the Bab. He had come to the end of his quest. In due course, the Bab's Epistle was taken to Baha'u'llah, Who accepted the Truth that it contained. 

 Thus at the age of twenty-seven, the Son of the minister, Who had withdrawn from the life of the court, the brilliant  nobleman Whose sense of justice was a byword amongst all who knew Him, Whose knowledge, eloquence and lovable nature were exemplary, put Himself on the side ofareligious renaissance that was bound to excite the hatred of the ruling classes of the realm. 

 The Bab had implicit assurance that the nobleman of Nfir would ultimately wield the sceptre of supreme authority. 

 It was the DAb Who assigned to Him the designation Baha'u'llah  — the Glory of God. One cannot fail to perceive the affection, the respect and the attachment which the BTh showed towards Baha'u'llah, sentiments which found no parallel in His regard for the rest of His able and devout followers. 

 Soon after His conversion, IBahA'u'lldh travelled to His native province on the shores of the Caspian Sea, to promote the Message of the DAb. He was highly esteemed in MAzin-darAn, and therefore apt to arouse controversy in orthodox camps. He challenged a clergyman of considerable local standing to refute His proofs, but the latter, finding himself unequal to the task, evaded the issue. 

 Then, in the middle part of 1848, occurred the Conference of Badasht. The followers of the Bab, harassed and persecuted, witnessing their Master in prison and cruel detention, came to meet in a secluded part of Khur6sAn in the northeast of Persia, to examine the problems facing them as a hounded community and adherents  of a proscribed Faith. There was present the learned and confident Qudd6s, the most venerated of the first disciples of the IBAb —  those who sought Him and found Him and believed in Him, and were named by Him "The Letters of the Living". There was the silver-tongued  and courageous poetess Qurratu'1-'Ayn, later known as TAhirili, another of the Letters of the Living and the only one of that band of eighteen who never met the 13Th, but believed in Him from afar and sent Him her eloquent homage through a kinsman who was setting out on his quest. Baha'u'llah, too, was there. Throughout the discussion He maintained a dignified silence, but when the Conference reached its end, His was the decisive and the undisputed word. 

 The BThis had not yet fully grasped the significance of the Bait's revelation. 

 Qurratu'1-'Ayn  discarded her veil and appeared in the assemblage of men with face uncovered, as a token of new birth and a new day. In that gathering she raised her voice in defiance of superstition, prejudice and blind imitation. Qudd6s, deeply versed in theology, and firm in his beliefs, would not sanction the advanced measures advocated by Qurratu'1-'Ayn. Now Baha'u'llah threw the weight of His innate


<p589>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS           589
wisdom into the balance.   

 The Bab, He told the assembly, was the Founder of a new Dispensation,  and stood in the same heavenly lineage as Mubammad, Jesus and Moses. A few halfhearted souls left disgustedly, but the great majority were confirmed in their faith. When the Rib heard of the outcome of the Conference of Bada~fit, His delight was immense. 

   From Badaslit Baha'u'llah  

 returned to TibrAn. Not long after, He visited MullA Ijusayn, who, with more than three hundred Bab's had sought refuge in the shrine of ~hay~li Tabarsi in the forests of M&zindardn. 

 MullA ~Iusayn built defences around the shrine, and was eventually joined by Quddas. The infuriated clergy stormed the government to send a punitive expedition against that hounded band of innocent and Godfearing men. Troops marched and laid siege to the fortress which sheltered the Bab's. 

 Hearing the news, Baha'u'llah left promptly for the Fort of Tabarsi, wishing to share the calamities of His brethren in faith. 

 Providence had deemed that the heroic defenders of Sliay~li Tabarsi should seal the Covenant of the Bab with their blood, and that Baha'u'llah should be preserved for a far greater purpose in days to come. 

 He was stopped  on His way, by the Governor's men, and taken to the town of Amul. The doctors of religion preached death, and the mob thirsted for violence. In order to appease the populace, the deputy-governor decided to inflict some kind of punishment on the members of Baha'u'-lidli's  retinue. 

Baha'u'llah offered Himself 

 in lieu of His friends, and voluntarily drew the wrath of the mob upon His own Person. He was bastinadoed. 

 On July 9th, 1850, the gracious and gentle Bab was shot in the public square of Tabriz. His breast, that heaved not but in adoration of God, was made the target of bullets. 

 Baha'u'llah had sent SulaymAn Kb&n, a brilliant and brave youth, to rescue the mangled remains of the Bab from the fury of the foe. And then He arranged for the concealment of the remains in order to protect them from the evil designs of the oppressors. For more than fifty years they were hidden from the knowledge of friends and enemies alike. Today they rest on Mount Carmel, in a beautiful mausoleum under a golden dome. 

 Not only did the Bab quaff the cup of martyrdom, but His able and selfless lieutenants were one by one hunted down with brutal hatred —  Mulh Ijusayn, Quddfis, the erudite and fearless Vabid of D6.nib, the indomitable Ijujiat of Zanj6n, all murdered and gone. In the length and breadth of Inin the Bab's had no peace, no security, no right to life itself How long can a mutilated and agonised community bear and sustain the severe impact of continuous shocks! Baha'u'llah's arduous task had already begun. In Him were centred all those highest qualities, human and divine, that went to make the Bab and Quddfls. 

 On Him, and Him alone, depended  the fate of the Bab's. It was to Him that the Rib had sent His seals, pen, and papers, a symbolic act of untold significance. 

  In June, 1851, Baha'u'llah travelled to 'IrAq. There the Bab's lived in comparative safety, but were distracted and forlorn. Baha'u'llah refortified  their faith, and gave them fresh hope. No sooner had He returned to TihrTh than the storm broke out again. It was more than a storm. It was a holocaust. 

 The BANs presented, indeed, a sad spectacle in this period of their short but eventful history. Their morale was impaired and their energy sapped. The fickle and the timid amongst them could see no redeeming hand, no prospect of emancipation. 

 Two irresponsible young men, driven to despair, decided to avenge their Master and their martyred brethren. 

 To them the source of persecution and tyranny seemed to be no other than the person of the 

Sovereign                  

 — the ShTh, in whose hand was the power to give them justice. The ShAh, they argued in their tormented minds, had not exercised his sovereign  authority in favour of their maligned and oppressed community, and therefore he had to pay the supreme penalty. 

 So deranged were their faculties that they did not put in their pistols proper bullets for killing a man. 

 On August 12th, 1852, they ventured upon their insane attempt and failed. 

 The ShAh received only superficial injuries. 

 The wouldbe murderers were not given the chance of a trial, and were summarily dealt with. But the matter did not end there. The enemies of the B&b had found their golden opportunity to exterminate His followers. 

 Here at last, they frenziedly declaimed,  was the proof of a deadly menace to the 

State.                     

 Baha'u'llah was, at this moment, staying in a summer residence in the vicinity of the capital.


<p590>
590                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 His friends warned Him of the engulfing tide. They offered to hide Him from the wrath of His ill-wishers. 

 But he remained calm and composed.  He had nothing to fear, and the next day He rode towards the camp of the ShAh. 

 The news of His approach confounded the enemy. Whilst they were plotting His arrest, and starting to search for Him, lIe was coming to them, of His own accord. But when had Baha'u'llah ever shown fear or panic? 

 They laid their rough hands upon His Person. On the road to the dungeon in TihrAn, a big crowd gathered to jeer at Him and to heap in-suits upon Him. He Who had been their friend and defender, their shield and support in need, was now the victim of their blazing hatred. 
     People did the same to     

Jesus. On Palm Sunday      

 they went out to greet Him. They gave Him a royal welcome. And Jerusalem echoed with "Hosanna to the Son of David". "Blessed is He,"they cried, "that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the Highest." A few days later, in the courtyard of Pontius Pilate, they were given a choice. Which should die? Barrabas, the proved and convicted criminal, or Jesus, the Light of the World? They asked for the death of Jesus. They rejected the Christ. "Crucify Him," they cried. 

 Thus has the world ever treated its true friend. Among the crowd, which hurled abuse at Baha'u'llah and pelted Him with stones, was an old woman. She stepped forward with a stone in her hand to strike at Him. Although frenzied with rage, her steps were too weak for the pace of the procession. 

 "Give me a chance to fling my stone in His face," she pleaded with the guard. Baha'u'llah turned to them and said, "Suffer not this woman to be disappointed. Deny her not what she regards as a meritorious act in the sight of God." Such was the measure of His compassion. 

 About the attempt on the life of the ShAh Baha'u'llah writes in His Epistle to the Son of the Wolf' "By the righteousness of God! We were in no wise connected with that evil deed, and Our innocence was indisputably established by the tribunals. Nevertheless, they apprehended Us, and from NiyAvarAn, which was then the residence of His Majesty, conducted Us, on foot and in chains, with bared head and bare feet, to the dungeon of TibrAn. A brutal man, accompanying  Us on horseback, snatched off Our hat, whilst We were being hurried along by a troop of executioners and officials. We were consigned  for four months to a place foul beyond comparison. 

 As to the dungeon in which this Wronged One and others similarly wronged were confined, a dark and narrow pit were preferable. Upon Our arrival We were first conducted along a pitch-black corridor, from whence We descended three steep flights of stairs to the place of confinement assigned to Us. The dungeon was wrapped in thick darkness,  and Our fellow-prisoners numbered nearly a hundred and fifty souls: thieves, assassins  and highwaymen. 

 Though crowded, it had no other outlet than the passage by which We entered. 

 No pen can depict that place, nor any tongue describe its loathsome smell. Most of these men had neither clothes nor bedding to lie on. God alone knoweth what befell Us in that most foul-smelling and gloomy place I"~ The prison cell in which Baha'u'llah was confined, together with many other BThis, was a grim, dark and stench-laden pit that once had served as a reservoir for a public bath, and to which the worst criminals were now consigned. Around His neck they placed one of the two most dreaded chains in the whole land. 

 Under its ponderous weight His whole frame was bent. In that same book, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Baha'u'llah speaks of those awesome chains: "Shouldst thou at sometime happen to visit the dungeon of His Majesty the ShAh, ask the director and chief jailer to show thee those two chains, one of which is known as QarA-Guhar, and the other as SalAsil. 

 I swear by the DayStar of Justice that for four months this Wronged One was tormented and chained by one or the other of them. 'My grief exceedeth all the woes to which Jacob gave vent, and all the afflictions of Job are but a part of My sorrows!"2 Nabil, the immortal historian of the Baha'i Faith, recounts in his work the words which he himself heard from Baha'u'llah, describing the torments of those days: "We were all huddled together in one cell, our feet in stocks, and around our necks fastened the most galling of chains. 

 The air we breathed was laden with the foulest of impurities, while the floor on which we sat was covered with filth and infested with vermin. 
No ray of Light was

 allowed to penetrate that pestilential dungeon or to warm its icy coldness. 

 We were placed in two rows, each facing the other. We had taught them to repeat certain verses which, every night, they chanted with extreme fervour. 'God is sufficient unto me; He verily is the All-suffi-cing!'  one row would intone, while the other would reply: 'In Him let the trusting trust.' The chorus of these gladsome voices would continue to peal out until the early hours of the morning. Their reverberation would fill the dungeon, and, piercing its massive walls, would reach the ears of NAsiri'd-Din ShAh, whose palace was not far distant from the place where we were imprisoned. 
'What means this sound?'   

 he was reported to have exclaimed. 'It is the anthem the Bab's are intoning in their prison,' they replied. 

 The ShTh made no further remarks, nor did be attempt to restrain the enthusiasm which his prisoners, despite the horrors of their confinement,  continued to display."3 Day by day an official would come to the prison and call out the names of those who were to meet their martyr's death on that day. And out would walk those whose names were called, with firm steps and shining brows. 

 Hundreds of BThis died in that bloodbath of 1852, after being subjected to excruciating tortures. 

 One of that glorious band was SulaymAn Khgn the same brave spirit who, at the bidding of Baha'u'llah, had rescued the body of the BA!,. They bored nine holes in his body and placed nine lighted candles in them. Thus they paraded him in the streets, with a howling mob jeering at his heels. 

 SulaymAn KhAn was a young courtier, accustomed to power and display. 

 On this day of his martyrdom he stopped in the midst of his tortures and exclaimed: "What greater pomp and pageantry than those which this day accompany my progress to win the crown of glory! Glorified be the ]Thb, Who can kindle such devotion in the breasts of His lovers, and can endow them with a power greater than the might of kings." As the candles flickered in his wounds, he said, "You have long lost your sting, 0 flames, and have been robbed of your power to pain me. Make haste, for from your very tongues of fire I can hear the voice that calls me to my Beloved !"~ And when one of his tormentors reviled him, he answered with these lines: "Clasping in one hand the wine-cup, in one hand the Loved One's hair; Thus my doom would I envisage dancing through the market-square." 
                           
 Thus died Sulaym6n KhAn.   

 Another victim in this tornado was TAhirih, the beautiful, talented poetess of Qazvin — the same heroic soul who, at the Conference of Badasht raised the call of the emanicpation of her sex. Now in the dead of night they strangled her and cast her body into a pit of which no trace was left. But the memory of her supreme constancy, courage and devotion will forever endure. She knew of her approaching end and was ready for it. To her hostess, the wife of the magistrate in whose custody she was placed, TAhirili said on the day preceding the night of her martyrdom: "I am preparing to meet my Beloved, and wish to free you from the cares and anxieties of my imprisonment." 
She was in bridal array.   

 Such was the fortitude of the BANs and such was the magnitude of their sacrifice. 

  For four agony-laden months Baha'u'llah lingered in chains, in that dismal, pestilential dungeon of 

Tihrdn.                    

 But it was in the dark of that dungeon that Baha'u'llah saw the Light of God shining in His own Self. 

 He Himself gives us a vivid and overpowering account of those hours when He became conscious of His heavenly Mission. 

 "During the days I lay in the prison of TilirAn, though the galling weight of the chains and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep, still in those infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed from the crown of My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth itself upon the earth from the summit of a lofty mountain. Every limb of My body would, as a result, be set afire. 

 At such moments My tongue recited what no man could bear to hear."5 God, in His infinite Grace, gave the world a Universal 

Manifestation of His       

 Absolute Qualities and Attributes. The promise of the DAb, nay, the promise of all the Messengers of God, was fulfilled. 

 The time, however, had not come for a public declaration. Ten more years had to elapse, before Baha'u'llah would announce His Manifestation to human kind. 

  There was no shadow of doubt that Baha'u'llah was not an accomplice in the attempt made

 on the life of the Sh&h. Yet the enemies were loath to release Him, and at the same time they dared not bring Him to the scaffold. Once, poison was introduced into His food, and the effect of it remained with Him for many years. In the end He was freed and exiled from IrAn. His property was confiscated, and nothing was left to Him of His wealth. The Russian minister invited Him to go to Russia where He would be assured of a free unmolested life. 

 IBah&u'llAh declined the invitation, and chose to proceed to 'Iraq. On January 12th, 1853, He left TibrAn, never to return. With Him were the members of His family. 
The winter was severe.    

 The route was over high mountains covered with deep snow, and the means of comfort were scant. Deprived of all His earthly goods, Baha'u'llah could not provide such facilities as. would lessen the toils and hardships of that long and arduous journey. 

 Travelling under those adverse conditions  was immensely hard, and the pace was necessarily slow. 

  As Baha'u'llah neared the frontier, a period drew to its close. Were the people of fran aware of the loss they sustained? 

 Steepedin ignorance, sunk in bigotry, blinded by prejudice, theirs was not to see and know. And thus Baha'u'llah passed out of their midst. tie Who once was loved and respected by rich and poor, high and low, prince and peasant alike, was now deserted by the same people on whom He had lavished mercy, love, justice, and charity at all times. Persia lost the presence of Baha'u'llah, but could His spirit ever be absent from that or any other land? 

 In the Epilogue to Nab il's Narrative, a history of the early days of the Cause, written by Nabil of Zarand, and translated by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i 

Faith, Shoghi Effendi     

 thus described those tempestuous  days culminating in Baha'u'llah's exile: "Never had the fortunes of the Faith proclaimed by the BTh sunk to a lower ebb than when Baha'u'llah was banished from His native land to 'IrAq. 

 The Cause for which the 13Th had given His life, for which Baha'u'llah had toiled and suffered, seemed to be on the very verge of extinction. Its force appeared to have been spent, its resistance irretrievably broken. 

 Discouragement  and disasters, each more devastating in its effect than the preceding one, had succeeded one another with bewildering rapidity, sapping its vitality and dimming the hopes of its stoutest supporters."6 Baha'u'llah arrived at Baghdad in March, 1853. 

 His physical strength was momentarily impaired. 

 To a casual observer He might have looked like a man approaching His end. Indeed the court and the priesthood of IrAn were confident  that Baha'u'llah was doomed to an early death and oblivion. But He survived all the hardships to which He was subjected, and as soon as He recovered from the effects of His harsh imprisonment and painful journey, He arose to reassemble and reanimate the stricken and shattered community of the Bin. That was the resolve He had come to, in the dungeon of TihrAn. 

 "Day and night, while confined in that dungeon," He tells us, "We meditated upon the deeds, the condition, and the conduct of the Bab's, wondering what could have led a people so high-minded, so noble, and of such intelligence,  to perpetrate such an audacious and outrageous act against the person of His Majesty. This Wronged One, thereupon, decided to arise, after His release from prison, and undertake, with the utmost vigour, the task of regenerating this people. 

 "One night, in a dream, these exalted words were heard on every side: 'Verily, We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy Pen. Grieve Thou not for that which bath befallen Thee, neither be Thou afraid, for Thou art in safety. Ere long will God raise up the treasures of the earth — men who will aid Thee through Thyself and through Thy Name, wherewith God hath revived the hearts of such as have recognized Him."'7 The plight of the Bab's was grievous indeed. Stunned by the staggering blows dealt them by a vigilant and relentless enemy, disintegrated by factional strifes, they could not for the moment observe the guiding hand of Baha'u'llah. 

 Yet, unknown to friend and foe, He was the Repository of Divine Revelation, the Vicar of God on Earth. 

 The BTh had clearly, and in most emphatic language, foretold the proximity of the advent of "Him Whom God Will Make Manifest", that World Educator Who was to rear and lead humanity in the "Day of Days". 

 At this period many an adventurer forwarded a claim to that station. 

 Thus a number of the B6tis were

  divided into numerous parties, each supporting one of these self-appointed messiahs. The nominal head of the BThi Community, Baha'u'llah's  half-brother, 

Mirza Ya~y~, entitled Subl2-i-Azal

 or "Morning of Eternity", was incompetent to cope with the forces of disruption. 

 He lacked courage. At a time when RaM'-u'llAh was facing the enemy with calm fortitude, Azal was a fugitive trying to save his own life. 

 When Baha'u'llah was in chains, Azal roamed the countryside, in disguise. 

 in the garb of a dervish, he reached BaghdAd, sometime after the arrival of Baha'u'llah, not having raised so much as a finger in vindication of the Cause. It was Baha'u'llah Who had exposed Himself to the fury of the court and the clergy. As conflicts grew and rifts widened, as baseless  claims became more blatant, the hopes of the Bab community sank lower and lower. 

 And yet, still unknown to the Bab's as the One promised to them by the Bab, there was amongst them and suffering with them, He Who


<p594>
594                THE HAHA'i WORLD

 was destined to change their misery to glory, their weakness to towering strength. 

 No sooner had Baha'u'llah started upon the task of rescuing the Bab's from their waywardness, than ~ubb-i-Aza1, goaded by a few of the self-seeking who had chosen to make that already discredited figure the instrument of their own treacherous designs, began to obstruct Baha'u'llah's benevolent lead. So fierce became the opposition engineered by Azal that Baha'u'llah decided to retire from the scene of contention. 

 He had no wish to add to the injuries afflicting the B~bi community. One morning His household awoke to find Him gone. He sought an abode in the mountains of KurdistAn. Such seclusion from the society of men has always occurred in the lives of the Manifestations of God. Moses went out to the desert of Sinai. 

 Buddha sought the wilds of India. Christ walked the wilderness. Mubam-mad paced the sunbaked hullocks of Arabia. 

 Baha'u'llah's self-imposed exile was a test. Were He to be the only Guide cap~tb1e of showing  the right path to the BANs, the only One Who could restore to them their broken inner peace, their vision, their serenity, their faith and determination, the passage of time and His absence would prove it conclusively. And time did amply demonstrate the fact. This is how He writes of those days: "A number of people who have never inhaled  the fragrance of justice, have raised the standard of sedition, and have leagued themselves  against Us. On every side We witness the menace of their spears, and in all directions We recognize the shafts of their arrows. 

 This, although We have never gloried in anything, nor did We seek preference over any soul. To everyone We have been a most kindly companion,  a most forbearing and affectionate friend. 

 In the company of the poor We have sought their fellowship, and amidst the exalted and learned We have been submissive and resigned. I swear by God, the one true God! grievous as have been the woes and sufferings which the hand of the enemy and the people of the Book inflicted upon Us, yet all these fade into utter nothingness when compared with that which hath befallen Us at the hand of those who profess to be Our friends. 
  "What more shall We say?   

 The universe, were it to gaze with the eye of justice, would be incapable of bearing the weight of this utterance! 

 ance! In the early days of Our arrival in this land, when We discerned the signs of impending  events, We decided, ere they happened, to retire. We betook Ourselves to the wilderness, and there, separated and alone, led for two years a life of complete solitude. 

 From Our eyes there rained tears of anguish, and in Our bleeding  heart there surged an ocean of agonizing pain. Many a night We had no food for sustenance,  and many a day Our body found no rest. By Him Who hath My being between His hands! 

 notwithstanding these showers of afflictions and unceasing calamities, Our soul was wrapt in blissful joy, and Our whole being evinced an ineffable gladness. For in Our solitude  We were unaware of the harm or benefit, the health or ailment, of any soul. 

 Alone, We communed with Our spirit, oblivious of the world and all that is therein. We knew not, however, that the mesh of divine destiny ex-ceedeth  the vastest of mortal conceptions, and the dart of His decree transcendeth the boldest of human designs. None can escape the snares He setteth, and no soul can find release except through submission to His WilL By the righteousness of God! Our withdrawal contemplated no retail, and Our separation hoped for no reunion. 

 The one object of Our retirement  was to avoid becoming a subject of discord among the faithful, a source of disturbance unto Our companions, the means of injury to any soul, or the cause of sorrow to any heart. Beyond these, We cherished no other intention, and apart from them, We had no end in view. And yet, each person schemed after his own desire, and pursued his own idle fancy, until the hour when, from the Mystic Source, there came the summons bidding Us return whence We came. Surrendering Our will to His, We submitted to His injunction."8 Gradually the fame of Baha'u'llah spread around the district of Su1aym~niyyih. 

 None in the neighbourhood knew His identity, but all were charmed by His kindliness and wisdom. Some mistook Him for an adherent of a SPfi order. He was known by the name of 

Darvish Mubammad. And      

 in a widening circle, Bagli-dAd  came to hear of the wise hermit who had appeared in the mountainous regions of the north. 

 They spoke of His knowledge, gentleness,  piety and astonishing insight.

  dissension, longed for His guidance, but knew not where to seek Him. No sooner did some of them hear of the Sage of Sulaym6niyyih, than they saw behind that veil the very Person of Baha'u'llah, and dispatched emissaries to find Him and implore His return. 

 Baha'u'llah was surprised to see them, but He knew that He had to answer the call. This was the voice of God, the plan of Providence. Time had shown His indispensability to the community of the 

Bit.                       

 On March 19th, 1856, Baha'u'llah returned to Baha'u'llah. 

 His absence had lasted two years. 

 Henceforth His power, His word, and His command were gladly welcomed by the Bab's. They had gone through a severe ordeal, and had learned their lesson in the school of adversity. No doubt opposition was still rife. Azal, a man of weak will, was held aloft by a handful of the ambitious and the self-seeking, as a puppet leader. But the BThis had come to know them for what they were. Baha'u'llah exerted His utmost efforts to protect His half-brother from the seditious devices of plotters and agitators, but Azal was of an inferior type. He disregarded


<p596>

 the sound advice of the One Who was his true friend, and became more and more implicated in vain scheming. 

 Hitherto, the believers in the ETh had been recruited from the Shf'ih sect of Islam. Now, under the aegis of Baha'u'llah, others came to enlist. He recreated the withered lives of the Bab's. They were told not to resist by violence any encroachments made on their liberties. In this manner He stemmed the tide of lawlessness that at one time had seriously menaced the integrity of the BAN community. 

 And so it came that Baha'u'llah's Divine guidance rallied the Bab's once again to a noble life. Once again they lived with faith in their hearts, their deeds testifying to the belief they bore. 

 * * * The Cause of the BTh was once more healthy and alive. The gloom of drift and anarchy had dispersed. 

 From far and wide the Bab's came to bask in the sunshine of Baha'u'llah's love and guidance. Savants and learned men brought their intricate problems and received solutions to their satisfaction. But the renown attending upon the name of Baha'u'llah stirred anew the feelings of envy and hatred. A number of the Shi'ih divines assembled to determine a plan of action against the Faith of the Bab and its revered Exponent. 

 One should take note of the fact that ~haykh-i-Ans~ri the most prominent of them all, refused to participate in their deliberations. 

 They commissioned one of their members to wait upon Baha'u'llah and demand convincing proofs. 

 This man did as he was bidden, and went back with a definite offer —  Baha'u'llah would bring forth any proof that the clergy might require, on condition that they would on their part pledge themselves to accept His authority thereafter. Their emissary told them that he had witnessed nothing but truth and righteousness in the wards and deeds of the Bab Leader. Those men had come together, not to find truth, but to oppose it. Fearful lest Baha'u'llah should really bring forth the proof demanded by them, they refused to give any pledge, rejected the offer, and brought pressure upon the government of the ShTh to adopt repressive measures. The man who acted as their emissary, himself a noted cleric, was disgusted  by their behaviour, and as long as he lived, told the people the truth of what acutally transpired. 

 The Persian Consul in BaghdTh supported the divines, and so insistent became their pleading, cajoling and finally intimidation that the Shdh took fright and instructed his envoy at Constantinople to enter into negotiations with the 

Turkish government. He    

 wanted Baha'u'llah  to be escorted to the frontier, and handed over to his men. Failing that he demanded the removal of Baha'u'llah to a locality far from the borders of IrAn. Negotiations went on for some time between the two States, and at last the SultAn ordered the Governor of BaghdAd to send Baha'u'llah to Constantinople. 

 His enemies were jubilant, and His friends horrified and sorrowful. Can we stretch our imagination far enough to visualise the despondency and the heartache of the Bab's in that month of April, 1863? Can we contemplate their grief? 

 Baha'u'llah moved to the garden of Ri4vAn, outside the gates of BaghdAd. 

 The Bab's thronged there to see the last of their Beloved so cruelly torn from their midst. It was the twenty-second day of April. With tears in their eyes they gathered around Him. He was calm, serene and unruffled. The hour had struck. To that company Baha'u'llah revealed Himself —  He was the Promised One in Whose path the BTh had sacrificed His life, "Him Whom God will make manifest", the ShAh-Bahrdm, the Fifth Buddha, the Lord of Hosts, the Christ come in the station of the Father, the Master of the 

Day of Judgment.          

  "Canst thou discover any one but Mc, 0 Pen, in this Day? What bath become of the creation and the manifestations thereof?

 "Rejoice with exceeding gladness, 0 people of Baha, as ye call to remembrance the Day of supreme felicity, the Day whereon the Tongue of the Ancient of Days bath spoken, as He departed from His House, proceeding to the Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendours of His name, the All-Merciful."9 Heads were bent as the immensity of that Declaration touched the consciousness of men. Sadness had vanished; joy, celestial joy, prevailed. 

     Baha'u'llah left BaghdAd    

 on May 3rd, 1863, and arrived at the capital of the Turkish Empire three months later. He had been summoned there on the orders of the SultAn. Was lie to face a formal trial? Was His case to be investigated by the Ottoman ruler in person? Was He to be led to prison in some distant part or to be kept indefinitely in Istanbul? Such questions undoubtedly assailed the minds of His people; no one was certain. Yet, although they could find no convincing answers, and although the future looked dark and perilous, many of His followers shared His exile with willing hearts. 

    From the Sublime Porte     

 Baha'u'llah solicited no favour. His only protest was His silence. Several of the dignitaries of the capital called upon Him. Mound an oriental court in thelast century thrived malcontents and intriguers. While Living in IHag~dAd, Baha'u'llah had been approached by a number of such persons who had hoped to win the affection of the BThfs. 

 He had refused to meet them, and the few who gained admittance to His presence had received no encouragement. 

In Constantinople, Baha'u'llah 
adhered to the same rule.  

 He refused all association with their designs. His Cause had not the remotest connection with sedition; in fact, the whole urge of His teachings was absolutely otherwise. Was this not also the path taken by Christ eighteen hundred years before? Calm, serene and patient, Baha'u'llah awaited the decision of 

His oppressors. Thus He    
spent four months at Istanbul.

 At last they banished Him to Adirnih (Adrianople). 

 So began another journey fraught with hardships. 

 In falling snow, He and His companions set out towards their destination, without adequate  means to provide against the rigours of a severe winter. 

 The journey took them twelve days, and they arrived at Adirnili in a state of exhaustion. Yet even thus engulfed, Baha'u'llah could write in such terms as these: "lam not impatient of calamities in His way, nor of afflictions for His love and at His goodpleasure... 

 Through affliction bath His light shone, and His praise been bright unceasingly; this has been His method through past ages and bygone times." 

 Baha'u'llah was now a prisoner of the Ottoman  government. 

 It had no charge to bring against Him, and yet it restrained the freedom of His movements. 

    At Adrianople Baha'u'llah  

 issued an open and public announcement of His Revelation, and the Bab's, wherever they were, except for a few dissident voices, rallied to His Cause and submitted to His God-given Authority. 

 Henceforth  they were styled Baha'is. Azal, however, though outwardly subdued, was, with a number of the self-seeking around him, secretly engaged in opposition. The account of his intrigues and base dealings makes sorry reading. 

 He and his accomplices dared not come into the open, because their motives were too transparent not to be detected and exposed. 

 Azal imagined that he was undermining Baha'u'llah's position; in fact he was bringing ruin upon himself. 

 Baha'u'llah  did His utmost to save His brother, but His kindness and generosity met with more venom and hatred. Time, that unfaltering test of right and wrong, eventually showed the hollowness of Azal's contention and the misery of his purpose. 

 He introduced poison into Baha'u'llah's food. Baha'u'llah's life was saved, but the effects of that deadly substance remained  with Him to the end of His days. Having failed in his dastardly attempt, Azal turned round and pointed an accusing finger at Baha'u'llah. 

 It was his Brother, he alleged, Who had poisoned the food, and then accidentally partaken of it. Today, at the remove of a century, we can pity the malefactor, and feel amused by his calumnies and presumptions. At the time, such vile conduct served to increase the rigours of Baha'u'llah's life. 

 The following is an extract from the autobiography of UstAd Muhammad-'Ali, the barber attendant upon 

Baha'u'llah in Adria-nople: 

 One day, while I was attending at the bath,

 years. One day, when the Governor was in the bath, this boy went in with a knife, and as the Governor came out of the water, he stabbed him in the belly and ripped him open. The Governor cried out and his servants rushed into the bath, saw the boy with the knife in his hand and attacked him. Then they went to see how their master was, and the boy, although wounded,  rose up and stabbed him again. 

 Azal again began to praise bravery and to say how wonderful  it is to be courageous. He then said, 'See what they are doing in the Cause; everybody has risen up against me, even my brother, and in my wretched state I know nothing of comfort.' 

 His tone and implication were that he, being the successor of the BTh, was the wronged one and his Brother an usurper and aggressor. (I take refuge in God!) Then he again said that bravery is praiseworthy, and the Cause of God needs help. In all this talk, relating the story of the Governor of Nayriz and praising bravery and encouraging me, he was really urging me to kill Baha'u'llah. 

 The effect of all this upon me was so disturbing that I had never felt so shattered in my life. 

 I felt as if the building were tumbling about me. 

 I said nothing, but in a very agitated state of mind went out to the anteroom and sat upon the bench there. I told myself that I would go back to the bath and cut off his head, no matter what the consequences. Then I reflected that to kill him was not an easy matter and perhaps I would offend 

Baha'u'llah. Suppose       

 I kill this man, I said to myself, and then go into the presence of the Blessed Perfection and He asks me why I killed him, what answer could I give? This thought prevented me from carrying out my intention. I returned to the bath and being very angry told Azal to 'clear off'.* Azal began to whimper and to tremble and asked me to pour water over his head to wash off the henna. I complied and he washed and went out of the bath in a state of great trepidation and I have never seen him since. 

 My condition was such that nothing could calm me. As it happened the Blessed Perfection did not come to the bath that day, but Mirza Miis& (Baha'u'llah's faithful brother) came, and I told him that Azal had set me on fire with his fearful suggestion. Mirza MfisA said, "He has been thinking of this for years; take no notice of him. He has always been thinking in this way." 

 * in Persian tbis is highlyi nsulting. 

 No one else came to the bath so I closed it. I then went to the Master* and told Him that Mirza Ya~yA had spoken words which had infuriated me and that I had wanted to kill him but did not. 

 The Master said this was something which people did not realize and told me not to speak of it but to keep it secret. 

 I then went to Mirza Aq~ J6n (Baha'u'llah's amanuensis and secretary) and reported the whole incident to him and asked him to tell Baha'u'llah. AqA JAn returned and said: "Baha'u'llah says to tell UstAd Mubammad-'AII not to mention this to anyQne." 

 That night I collected all the writings of Azal and went to the coffee room of Baha'u'llah's house and burnt them in the brazier. Before doing so I showed them to seven or eight of the believers present, saying "These are the writings of Azal". 

 They all protested and asked me why I did it. I answered that until today I esteemed Azal highly, but now he was less than a dog in my sight. 

  From Adrianople, and later from 'Akka, Baha'u'llah addressed the rulers of the world in a series of Letters. To them He declared His Divine Mission, and called them to serve peace, justice and righteousness. 

 The majestic sweep of His counsel and admonition revealed in these letters, arrests the deepest attention of every earnest student of the Baha'i Faith. 

 Here we see a Prisoner wronged by the world, judged and condemned by a conspiracy of tyrants, facingthe concourse of sovereigns, nay, the generality of mankind. He stands in judgment  upon the values of human society, and undaunted, He throws a bold challenge, not alone to His oppressors, not alone to ephemeral shadows of earthly might and dominion, but principally to those dark passions and motives which dare to intervene between man and the goal destined for him by his Maker. 

 Here, an Exile rejected and betrayed is seen to be the True and Only 

Judge.                     

 *     *     * Baha'u'llah's fame was now spreading far and wide. Except for a very small number who supported Mal, the BANs, wherever they were, had accepted the Divine mandate of 

Baha'u'llah.  The Turkish  

 authorities in Adrianople treated Him with great courtesy and marked

  respect. Governors such as SulaymAn PAshA and Khurshid PAshA sought His company with eagerness. And many of His followers from Persia and neighbouring lands travelled to Adrianople to drink deeply at the fount of His Revelation. 

 All these things stung his adversaries  to fresh action. Azal and his miserable accomplices, discredited and disowned by the community, their tortuous devices and designs abortive and exposed, having failed repeatedly to shake the allegiance which the Bab's had given to Baha'u'llah, next tried to poison the minds of the rulers of the Ottoman Empire against Him — their true Benefactor Whom they hated so venomously. 

 They sent anonymous letters to Constantinople, in which they accused  Baha'u'llah of collusion with the Bulgarian  leaders and European powers in a plot to capture the capital with the aid of His followers. Sult6n 'Abdu'1-'Azfz and his ministers took fright and Azal's treachery bore him bitter fruit, for not only were Baha'u'llah and His people condemned to imprisonment in the desolate barracks of 'Akid, but Azal himself was banished, to Cyprus — to oblivion. 

 He outlived  Baha'u'llah, dragging on existence until the year 1912, impenitent to the end, a broken man, the victim of his passions and selfish pursuits. 

 One morning, without any previous intimation, soldiers were posted round the house of Baha'u'llah, and His followers were told to prepare for their departure from Adrianople. Baha'u'llah writes thus of that event: "The loved ones of God and His kindred were left on the first night without food. The people surrounded the house, and Muslims and Christians  wept over Us... We perceived that the weeping of the people of the Son (Christians) exceeded the weeping of others — a sign for such asponder."bO Aqa RhJ~, a steadfast follower of Baha'u'llah, who shared His exiles from BaghdAd to 'Ak1c~, relates that, "A great tumult seized the people. 

 All were perplexed and full of regret... Some expressed their sympathy, others consoled  us and wept over us. Most of our possessions were auctioned at half their value."'1 Some of the foreign consuls resident in Adrianople offered their assistance to Baha'u'llah,  which He courteously refused,

  ment's decision a travesty of justice, and felt unable to carry it through. 

 He deputed another official to inform Baha'u'llah of the judgment passed upon Him. People thronged to bid farewell to the One Whom they had learned to love and esteem. With tears welling from their eyes, they kissed the hem of His robe. 

 On August 12th, 1868, Baha'u'llah and His family, accompanied by a Turkish escort, took once again the road to exile. They reached 'Akka on the last day of the month. 

 'Akka, Ptolemais of the ancient world, St. Jean d'Acre of the Crusaders that defied the siege of Richard I of England, and in a later age refused to bow to the might of Napoleon, a city that had gathered renown throughout the centuries, had indeed fallen into disrepute at this period of its chequered history. Its air and water were foul and pestilential Proverb had it that a bird flying over 'Ak1c~ would fall dead. To its forbidding barracks were consigned the desperadoes and dangerous criminals of the Ottoman realms — there to perish. 

 This was also the city of which David had spoken as "The Strong City", which Hosea had called "A door of hope", of which Ezekiel had said, "Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east."12 And the Founder of IslAm had thus eulogized this very city, "Blessed the man that hath visited 'Akka, and blessed be he that bath visited the visitor of 'Ak/cd. 

 He that raisetlz therein the call to prayer, his voice will be lifted up unto Paradise."" The 'Aklc6 which opened its gates to receive as a prisoner the Deliverer of the world, was a city that had fathomed the depths of misery. And Baha'u'llah's exile to Palestine, the Holy Land, His incarceration in the grim citadel of 'Akka, was intended by His adversaries to be the final blow which, in their calculations, would shatter His Faith and fortune. How significant and momentous will this exile seem, if we recall certain prophecies uttered in the past. 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Son of Baha'u'llah and the Expounder of His Message, thus speaks of this stupendous event: "When Baha'u'llah came to this prison in the Holy Land, the wise men realized that the glad tidings which God gave through the tongue of the Prophets two or three thousand years before were again manifested, and that God was faith


<p603>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS           603

 ful to His promise; for to some of the Prophets He had revealed and given the good news that 'The Lord of Hosts should be manifested in the Holy Land.' All these promises were fulfilled and it is difficult to understand how Baha'u'llah could have been obliged to leave Persia, and to pitch His tent in this Holy Land, but for the persecution of His enemies, His banishment and exile."'4 "Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates," David had so majestically announced; "even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory."15 "The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them," Isaiah had said, "and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God."1' "The Lord will roar from Zion," had been Amos's testimony, "and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither."'7 And Micab had thus foreseen, ". from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain," he shall come.'8 Life in the barracks of 'Akka was indeed hard and hazardous. The prisoners were about seventy in number: men, women and children, all huddled in a few dirty and nieagrely protected  cells. They were viewed with the utmost hostility by the townsmen. On their arrival they were greeted derisively at the landing-place by a group of idle onlookers who had gathered in a mocking mood to seethe "God of the Persians". The first night in the prison they were, Baha'u'llah  tells us, "deprived of either food or drink.. They even begged for water and were refused." Their rations consisted of three flat loaves of black and unpalatable bread for each person. Later slight concessions were made, but food remained pitiably inadequate and the water supply was polluted. 

 Before long disease raged among them. In vain they pleaded with the governor for medical succour. All but two were ill and helpless. 

 Thee of them died. Two of these were brothers who died, in the words of Baha'u'llah, "locked in each other's arms". Their bodies could not be removed, because the guards required money to induce them to carry out their duty. Baha'u'llah gave the carpet on which He slept, to be sold for this purpose. The sum thus raised was given to the wardens, and even then the dead were not given a proper burial. 

 But amidst their afflictions, the prisoners retained their serenity. They were happy because  they were co-sharers in the sufferings of their Lord, and dwelt near His Persop. 

 For a long while the Baha'is in IrAn and elsewhere possessed no news of Baha'u'llah. Later it was possible to establish communications, and a number came to 'Akka to find prison walls intervening between them and the One Whose presence they so eagerly sought. Some had journeyed on foot over the high mountains of western IrAn and the burning deserts of 'IrAq and Syria. They had perforce to content themselves with a momentary glimpse of His figure, as He stood behind the bars, and they beyond the second of the moats which surrounded the prison. Only a wave of His hands from afar was their reward; and then they turned homewards, grateful for the bounty conferred upon them. That was enough to kindle a more vigorous flame in their hearts, enough to make their dedication more dedicated. Others came in their wake, and took back the memory of that Figure appearing at the window, behind iron bars — a memory which they treasured above everything in their lives. And some had the supreme bounty of gaining admittance to the "Most Great Prison", to the Presence of Baha'u'llah. 

 Close confinement in the barracks lasted until October, 1870. Military reinforcements had been sent to that part of the Ottoman Empire and the citadel of 'Akka was in demand for their accommodation. 

 The prisoners were led out, but not to freedom. 

 Baha'u'llah and His family were conducted to a small house within the city walls, and others were lodged in a caravanserai. They were still held as prisoners inside the town. 

 Four months before this event a further tragedy, dire and poignant, had cast its shadow upon them. 

 That was the death of Mirza Milidi, entitled 

"The PurestBranch," a     
younger son of Baha'u'llah.

 He had shared his Father's exile from childhood, and was His amanuensis.


<p604>
604                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 One day at dusk, while walking on the roof of the prison, engaged in his devotions, he fell through a skylight and received fatal injuries. "His dying supplication to a grieving 

Father," writes Shoghi     
Effendi, the Guardian      

 of the Faith, "was that his life might be accepted as a ransom for those who were prevented from attaining the presence of their Beloved." He was twenty-two years old. 

 One might imagine that release from strict bondage would have spelt relief Such was not the case however. Enclosed within the barracks, Baha'u'llah and His companions had few contacts  with the inhabitants of 'Akl&, while rumours of the ugliest kind regarding them were spread abroad. Ignorant of the real identity of Baha'u'llah, the townsmen relegated Him and His followers to the same category as the previous inmates of the prison of 'Akka. Even worse, in their unrestrained imaginations, they laid every odious act to the charge of the Baha'is, whom they described as renegades from the true faith, traitors to the august person of the SultAn, plotters against the peace and the security of the land, licentious ruffians and outlaws who deserved the censure of the righteous. These were the same views held of Christians in the first centuries of the Christian Era. The Baha were ushered into this charged atmosphere of undisguised hatred and contempt. Their task of conciliation was indeed herculean. 

 Then bappened an awful act, committed by seven of the Baha, which added to the furies of the populace. When the Ottoman authorities sent Baha'u'llah to the prison of 'Akka, they included in the band of His followers accompanying  Him, some of the accomplices of Azal, as spies. These men never lost an opportunity to torment the exiles and spread falsehoods. Their constant schemings brought fresh sorrows in their wake, further incited the townsmen against Baha'u'llah, and placed His life in great jeopardy. On Ills part Baha'u'llah repeatedly exhorted His followers to forbearance,  and counselled them to avoid any deed which bore, no matter how remotely, any re. semblance to retaliation. But the treachery and malevolence of the adversaries waxed high. Then it was that seven of the Baha'is chose to disregard the injunctions of Baha'u'llah, and slew three of the evil men. 

 This flagrant act not only aroused the people, but forcing the intervention vention of the officials, subjected the Person of Baha'u'llah to arrest and interrogation. 'Abdu'l-Baha was put in chains for one night. Viewing this calamitous event, Baha'u'llah wrote: "My captivity cannot harm Me. That which can harm Me is the conduct of those who love Me, who claim to be related to Me, and yet perpetrate what causeth My heart and My pen to groan. My captivity can bring Me no shame," He also wrote. 

 "Nay, by My life, it conferretli on Me glory. 

 That which can make Me ashamed is the conduct of such of My followers who profess to love Me, yet in fact follow the 

Evil                       

  Such was the measure of Baha'u'llah's sufferings in the prison-city of 'Akka. 

  Notwithstanding the fierce prejudices which assailed them on every side, the Baha'is succeeded  before long in subduing the hatred of the populace. 

 A war was waged between the forces of character and integrity, and turbulent passions bred by ignorance. In the end victory went to the side which had risen above the plane of conflict, and in submitting its will to a Higher Will, had freed itself of fear and distrust.  It gradually dawned upon the officials and the leaders of religion that their Chief Prisoner was not an ordinary man, that they had in their custody a Personage of vastly superior gifts and powers. They became enamoured  of His majestic bearing, of His amazing knowledge of human affairs, of His disarming charity and forbearing nature. 

 Their prisoner He was, but a time came when it was almost impossible to realize the fact, or to enforce  the harsh and drastic injunctions of the government in Constantinople. 

 Baha came from far and wide, and with little difficulty attained the presence of Baha'u'llah. 

 High officials of the Ottoman government sought interviews with the Prisoner, to pay Him their respects. 

 The Mufti of 'Akka, who was once a bigoted opponent, gave Him his allegiance. 

 The new governor, Abmad Big Tawfiq, begged to be allowed to render Him a personal service, and was told by Him to repair, instead, the aqueduct outside the town which had become  derelict. 

 This measure ensured the water supply of 'Akka, and the people said that the air of their town had taken a decided turn for the better, since Baha'u'llah's arrival in their midst. Later, another governor, MustafA 9iyA

 PAsb~ made it known that should Baha'u'llah wish to leave 'Akka for the countryside, He would not be prevented. 

 However nine years elapsed before Baha'u'llah  left the confines of the city walls. 'Abdu'l-Baha  gives us a graphic account of the circumstances of that significant event. 

 Significant indeed it was, as it verified a promise uttered by Baha'u'llah long before, while still incarcerated in the forbidding barracks of the prison town. "Fear not," He had written, "these doors shall be opened, My tent shall be pitched on Mount Carmel, and the utmost joy shall be realized." 

 Baha'u'llah was very fond of the countryside, but, detained within the cheerless walls of 'Akka, He was barred from the beauties of nature. A day came when He said, "I have not gazed on verdure for nine years. The country is the world of the sou4 the city is the world of bodies." Then 'Abdu'l-Baha knew that the time had arrived when it would be possible to end the spell of imprisonment. Accordingly He went in search of a house in the plains. 

 Some four miles north of 'Akka, He rented the residence of 'Abdu'llAh PAshA. This is the house which we know as Mazra'ih. 

 He also rented the garden of Na'mayn which lay in the middle of a river, only a short distance from the city. Later Baha'u'llah gave it the name of RicjvAn, an honour reminiscent  of that garden outside Bag~d~d where Baha'u'llah first spoke of His Divine mandate. These abodes were ready to receive Him, but Baha'u'llah, considering Himself still a prisoner would not agree to leave the city walls. 

 He maintained that He was not entitled to the freedom of His movements. A second and a third time 'Abdu'l-Baha repeated His request to His Father, and received the same answer. Next the Mufti of 'Akka, Shay~h 'Aliy-i-Miri, who was very devoted to Baha'u'llah, pleaded with Him: "God forbid! Who has the power to make you a prisoner. 

 You have kept yourself in prison." At the end the S~ay~jh obtained His consent. 
    Mter two years at Mazra'ih,

Baha'u'llah moved His     

 residence to a neighbouring house —  the Mansion of Baha'i — built by a man named 'Udi Khamm6r, and there He lived the remaining  years of His life. Whilst Baha'u'llah was imprisoned in the citadel, this charming mansion  was in the process of construction. Now its owner had fled due to fear of a raging epidemic, and the spacious building was vacant. It was rented by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and afterwards purchased. 

 Baha, meaning "Delight", was near the coast, but far enough from the drab surroundings  of 'Akka to be invested with rural beauty. 

 From the windows of His room, Baha'u'llah could watch the pure blue of the Mediterranean, the distant minarets of the prison-city, and even further, beyond the bay, He could see the dim outline of the gentle slope of Mount Carmel. The Mansion, in all its splendour, stands guard today over the adjoining  Shrine which, to the Baha'is, is the most sacred spot on the face of the earth, and liar-bours  the mortal remains of Baha'u'llah. 

 In its radius one can experience that peace for which one's soul has ever yearned. 

 Dr. J. E. Esslemont, author of that immortal work, Baha'u'llah and the New Era, thus describes the life at Baha'i: "Having in His earlier years of hardship shown how to glorify God in a state of poverty and ignominy, Baha'u'llah  in His later years at Babji showed how to glorify God in a state of honour and affluence.  The offerings of hundreds of thousands of devoted followers placed at His disposal large funds which He was called upon to administer. Although His life at Baha'i has been described as truly regal, in the highest sense of the word, yet it must not be imagined that it was characterized by material splendour or extravagance. The Blessed Perfection and His family lived in very simple and modest fashion, and expenditure on selfish luxury was a thing unknown in that household. Near His home the believers prepared a beautiful garden called RhJvAn, in which He spent many consecutive days or even weeks, sleeping at night in a little cottage in the garden. 

 Occasionally He went further afield. He made several visits to 'Akka and Haifa, and on more than one occasion pitched His tent on Mount Carmel, as He had predicted when imprisoned in the barracks at 'Akki"20 It was to Baha that Edward Granville Browne, the distinguished orientalist and Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, then at the outset of his brilliant academic career, came in April, 1890. Returned home, he committed  to paper the impressions he had received: "So here at Behjd was I installed as a guest, in the very midst of all that Bab's accounts most noble and most holy; and here did I spend five most memorable days, during which I enjoyed unparalleled and unhoped-for opportunities of

 holding intercourse with those who are the very fountainheads of that mighty and wondrous spirit which works with invisible but ever-increasing  force for the transformation and quickening of a people who slumber in a sleep like unto death. It was in truth a strange and moving experience, but one whereof I despair of conveying any save the feeblest impression. I might, indeed, strive to describe in greater detail the faces and forms which surrounded me, the conversations to which I was privileged to listen, the solemn melodious reading of the sacred books, the general sense of harmony and content which pervaded the place, and the fragrant shady gardens whither in the afternoon we sometimes repaired; but all this was nought in comparison with the spiritual atmosphere with which I was encompassed. 

 The spirit which pervades the Bab's is such that it can hardly fail to affect most powerfully all subjected  to its influence. It may appal or attract: it cannot be ignored or disregarded. Let those who have not seen disbelieve me if they will; but, should that spirit once reveal itself to them, they will experience an emotion which they are not likely to forget."21 Edward Browne has left us a pen-portrait of Baha'u'llah. 

 It is the oniy one of its kind in existence, and therefore of tremendous value to the student of the Baha Faith. Today a visitor to Baha can read this document, before venturing  into Baha'u'llah's chamber. Thus can one try to recreate in one's mind the interview granted to the English orientalist: my conductor paused for a moment while I removed my shoes. Then with a quick movement of the hand, he withdrew, and, as I passed, replaced the curtain; and I found myself  in a large apartment, along the upper end of which ran a low divan, while on the side opposite to the door were placed two or three chairs. Though I dimly suspected whither I was going and whom I was to behold (for no distinct intimation had been given to me), a second or two elapsed ere, with a throb of wonder and awe, I became definitely conscious that the room was not untenanted. In the corner, where the divan met the wall, sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt headdress of the kind called nil by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. 

 The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jetblack hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. 

 No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain! 

 "A mild dignified voice bade me be seated, and then continued: "Praise be to God that thou ha st attained!... Thou liast come to see aprisoner and an exile. We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; yet they deem us a stirrer-up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment. 

 That all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled — what harm is there in this?... Yet so it shall be; these fruitless sin/es, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the "Most Great Peace" shall come. Do not you in Europe need this also? Is not this that which Christ foretold?... 

 Yet do we see your kings and rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the destruction of the human race than on that which would conduce to the happiness of mankind. 

 These .strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family.. 

 Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this; that he loves his kind...' 

 "Such, so far as I can recall them, were the words which, besides many others, I heard from BehA. Let those who read them consider well with themselves whether such doctrines merit death and bonds, and whether the world is more likely to gain or lose by their diffusion."22 In that year, 1890, Baha'u'llah visited Haifa, and pitched His tent on Mount Carmel. 

 To the Mountain of God came the Lord of Hosts, and the prophecies of old as well as His own emphatic  promise were fulfilled. He visited Haifa four times and once He raised His tent in the neighbourhood of the Carmelite monastery within which is the Cave of Elijah. There He revealed a Tablet which we know as the Tablet

  609 of Carmel, majestic and momentous, ringing with joy and with triumph. 

  * * * One day, Baha'u'llah, standing by the side of some lone cypress trees, nearly halfway up the slopes of Mount Carmel, pointed to an expanse of rock immediately below Him and told His Son, 'Abdu'l-Baha, that on that spot should be built the mausoleum to enshrine the remains of the Bab, the Martyr-Prophet-—  remains that had been kept in hiding since the second night after July 9th, 1850, the day on which the BTh was shot in the public square of Tabriz. 

 More than a decade had to elapse before 'Abdu'l-Baha could carry through the mandate laid upon Him by His Father. Today, on the very spot indicated by I3ahA'u'116h, stands a mausoleum  of glorious beauty, surmounted by a golden dome reflecting many hues of the sea and sky, and surrounded by gardens that ravish the eyes and enchant the soul. Within that mauso-lenin the mangled remains of the Martyr-Prophet  are laid to rest. 

 The last years of Baha'u'llah's life were devoted to writing and revealing innumerable Tablets, 

Epistles and Treatises    

 on many and varied subjects of spiritual and educative purport.  He was relieved of such cares as His supreme station entailed by the able administration  of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who shielded Him from the interference of the outside world and met and conversed with the officials of the Government,  inquirers and the learned, admitting into the Presence of Baha'u'llah only those who had genuine problems to resolve. 

 It was during the years of confinement within the city walls of 'Akka that He had revealed, besides many other Tablets, "The Mother Book of His Dispensation", thus styled by the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith. 
That was the Kitab-i-Aqdas

(The Most Holy Book).     

 Therein He specified the laws and the institutions of His World Order; addressed, admonished and warned the leaders and rulers of men, individually and collectively; exhorted His followers, indeed the generality of mankind, to walk in the paths of righteousness, to be just, to be tolerant, to be truthful, to be loyal, to shun division and conflict, to live in peace.* 

*    In the Kitab-i-Aqdas 

 there are laws thateoncern the individual,  and laws that guard the wellbeing of society; laws that find immediate application, and laws that await the world of the future. 

 The last book which flowed from His creative Pen was Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, a book addressed to a clergyman of IsfaliTh, an inveterate and notorious enemy of the Faith, whose greed and schemings resulted in murder and cruel persecution. 

 Here Baha'u'llah reiterates His challenge to His detractors, Ills Call is from God, His trust is in God, and no earthly power can deter Him in His purpose. Herein is also a representative selection from the vast volume of His Writings, culled and presented by Himself. 

   The Writings of Baha'u'llah

 in their range, their scope and their depth, remain unequalled amongst the Scriptures of mankind. 

 We should pause to examine in brief their nature and their purport. That erudite Baha'i scholar and teacher, Mirza Abu'1~FaCj1* of Gu1pAyg~n,t classifies them into four categories, namely, laws and ordinances; meditations, communes and prayers; interpretations of the sacred scriptures of the past; and finally discourses and exordiums. 

 Of the first category he writes: "Some of them contain laws and regulations whereby the rights and interests of all the nations of the world can be perpetuated, for these statutes are so enacted that they meet the necessities of every land and country, and are acceptable to every man of intelligence. 

 In this universality they resemble the laws of Nature, which secure the progress and development of all peoples; and they will bring about universal union and harmony."23 Some of the principal Works of the Author of the Baha'i Faith have been mentioned in previous pages, and it is impossible to tabulate the rest in this limited account of His life. Baha'u'llah states that the volume of His revealed Word totals the Scriptures of the Manifestations preceding Him. We ought to remember the incalculable advantage which the Writings of Baha'u'llah possess in relation to the Holy Books of former times. 

 Their originals are extant and well preserved,  and future generations will be spared the crushing responsibility of deciding the authenticity of the Works ascribed to the Prophet. 

 Oral tradition finds no place in the Scriptures of the Baha'i Faith. 

  Baha'u'llah left His human temple on the 29th of May, 1892. A telegram bore the news to the Sulpin of Turkey: "The Sun of DaM has set."

610                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Yet It shines dazzlingly in the full meridian. Its energizing and life-bestowing rays continue to revivify the hearts and minds of men, to penetrate the dark clouds of superstition, bigotry and prejudice, to disperse the heavy and oppressive fogs of despair and disillusionment, to shed light upon the baffling problems which bewilder a wayward, fatigued and storm-tossed  humanity. 

 Man has essayed to dim Its brilliance, to deny Its potency, to abjure Its gifts, to disparage Its claims — futile and bootless  attempts, for the signal proof of the sun remains the sun itself Seventy years separate us from the days when Baha'u'llah lived amongst men. The Faith which He proclaimed has encircled the globe and marches from triumph to triumph, and the resplendent edifice which Lie raised stands to offer certitude and peace to a disordered world. 

 In Ills Will and Testament, Baha'u'llah appointed 

His eldest Son, Whom       

 we know as 'Abdu'l-Baha (the Servant of Glory), the Centre of His Covenant with all men, and the sole Expounder of His revealed Word. His name was 'Abbas. 

 His Father referred to Him as the "Greatest Branch", and spoke of Him as the 

"Mystery of God". Baha'u'llah

 referred to Him also as the "Master", and so did the Baha'is. 'Abdu'l-Baha was the designation which He chose for Himself, after His Father's ascension. 

    The Will and Testament     

 of Baha'u'llah is indeed a unique document. Never before bad a Manifestation of God so explicitly established a Covenant to be the shield and the buttress of His Faith, or so clearly and indubitably named Him Who was to be His authorized successor with power to ward off the machinations of self-seekers, to keep pure and unsullied His Word, to preserve and watch over the unity of His followers, to bar sectarianism and banish corruption. 

 Indeed the Covenant of Baha'u'llah is, in the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, "the Sure Handle mentioned from the foundation of the World in the Books, the Tablets and the Scri>-aires of old." "The pivot of the oneness of mankind," 'Abdu'l-Baha has also said, "is nothing else but the power of the 

Covenant."                 

 Itis on this rock — therock of the Covenant —  that the edifice of the World Order is built. It is this ark, the ark of the Covenant, that has brought the Cause of Baha'u'llah safely through storms and hurricanes of unsurpassed intensity. 

 Many a Judas has tried to pierce this shield, the shield of the Covenant, only to find himself in grievous loss. 
   Baha'u'llah wrote in His    

Will and Testament:        
     "Although the Most High    

 Horizon is devoid of trivial possessions of the earth, We have nevertheless bequeathed unto Our heirs a noble and peerless heritage within the treasure-house of trust and resignation. 

 We have left no treasure nor have We added to man's pains. In bearing hardships and tribulations and in revealing verses and expounding proofs, it has been the purpose of this oppressed One to extinguish the fire of hate and animosity, that haply the horizons of the hearts of mankind may be illumined with the light of concord and attain real tranquillity. 

 Truly I say, the tongue is for mentioning that which is good; do not defile it by evil speech.. 
Man's station is great..   

 This is a Day great and blessed. Whatsoever  was hidden in man is today being revealed.  The station of man is great, were he to cling to truth and righteousness and be firm and steadfast in the Cause.. .0 people of the world! The religion of God is to create love and unity; do not make it the cause of enmity and discord. All that is regarded by men of insight and the people of most lofty outlook as the means for safeguarding and effecting the peace and tranquillity  of man, has flowed from the Supreme Pen.. 

 Do not make the cause of order a cause for disorder, nor the means of unity a means for disunity. 

 It is hoped that the people of Bah6. will observe the sacred verse: 'Say, all are created  by God'. 

 This lofty utterance is like unto water for quenching the fire of hate and hostility which is hidden and stored in men's hearts and minds. 

 This single utterance will cause the various sects and creeds to attain the light of true unity. 

 Verily, He speaketh truth and guideth to the right path; and He is the Mighty, the Glorious, the Omnipotent.. 

 Baha'u'llah had left the mortal phase. Many they were who came to mourn Him. They did not bear allegiance to Him, they could not see in Him the Redeemer of Mankind, yet they knew that a great Being had gone from their midst. 

 They were from diverse backgrounds and sects and Faiths — officials and leading figures and priests, learned men and poets, rich and poor, Druzes, 

Sunni and ShPih Muslims, Christians

 and Jews. From other cities such as


<p611>
ARTICLES A              Damascus and Aleppo and Cairo, they sent their eulogies and poems and tributes. And Baha'u'llah, at the time of His ascension, was still a prisoner of the Turkish government. No imperial edict of the Su1t~n had set Ejim free. 

 How different was this day of His ascension, when the plain stretching between the city of 'Akka and the Mansion of Babji teemed with crowds who came to pay Him homage and lament their loss, from that far-off day nearly twenty-four summers before when crowds had awaited His arrival at the seashore of 'Akka, to deride and insult Him. Total, unmitigated defeat seemed to be His fate then, and now all triumph was His. 

 Indeed, how strange and awe-inspiring had been the contrasts of His sojourn among men, particularly in the lloiy Land. 

 Brutally insulted in His native province, shorn of all earthly possessions, which He had in abundance, twice consigned to a prison of thieves and desperadoes, four times set on the road to exile, basely betrayed by His own brother whom He had endeavoured to protect, forced to seek the solitude of bare mountains, venomously and ferociously assailed and denounced and opposed by hordes of the mighty and the powerful and the insignificant alike, He had stood His ground with a certitude and a constancy which no adversity could shake and no cataclysm could thwart. And upon a swelling number of faithful adherents He conferred that supreme gift which Jesus had spoken of to Nicodemus when the Jewish nobleman sought Him in the dead of night — the gift of second birth. 

 He touched the hearts of men, and He won their allegiance by His Divine power. His followers were not alone in feeling its sweep and its command. 

 Many who had denied Him and reviled Him and openly contended  with Him, were eventually subdued by the charm, the majesty, the kindliness, the radiance of His Being. Indeed there were many amongst these erstwhile adversaries who, without  enrolling in the ranks of His followers, bore testimony to His supremacy, and lent their support in His defence. 

 And where was 'Abdu'1-'Aziz of Turkey, the SultAn who decreed His exile and incarceration?  Where was Napoleon, the Emperor of the French who disdained His summons and waxed proud before Him? Beaten, deposed, sunk in ignominy. 

 N&~iri'd-Din of Persia, who had cast Him out of His native land, and who had made Him take the road to exile twice, fell only five years after the ascension of Baha'u'llah, before the bullets of an avenger, on the very eve of his golden jubilee. 

 The records of history amply show that great was the fall of anyone, mighty or low alike, who dared to challenge Baha'u'llah, and gainsay His sovereignty.  No one has opposed Baha'u'llah and raised his hand to injure His Cause and His followers, and has escaped shame, doom and degradation. 

  This is an attempt to catch the ocean in a diminutive cup, to gaze at the orb though plain glass. Far, very far from man's effort must be an adequate portrayal of a Manifestation of the 

Qualities and Attributes   

 of Almighty God. And here we deal with the life of One Whose advent implies the "coming of age of the entire human race", and under Whose dominion the earth will become one fatherland.

Some Thoughts on the Peace Encyclical of Pope John XXIII

                   Uoo R. GIACHERY

  (Reprinted by permission. Copyright 1970 by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States.) 

  IF we consider the past history of mankind, we readily see that all religious institutions, from time immemorial, have been concerned with the problem of individual salvation. But the needs of people in their everyday lives and in their relation to society — their freedom and general welfare — were too frequently matters of concern only when the safety and continued existence of the religious institutions were challenged and endangered. 

 The clergy occupied  themselves with the beatitudes and the mystic aspects of life after death on the one hand and ritual and administration on the other. 

 They remained insensible to the longings of the masses, particularly in the fields of learning and knowledge. 

 The records of all extant revealed religions show clearly that in the beginning of each great Faith social progress was the concern of religion just as was spiritual salvation. 

 These were linked together as two aspects of the same truth. Every Founder of a great religion announced His purpose in revealing the Divine law to be "to bring happiness in the after life and civilization and refinement of character in this." As long as the fundamentals of the Founder's law were honoured and practised, as long as morality and both spiritual and material learning were the basis of culture, the conditions  of a given society advanced, and individuals  attained the saving qualities of faith in God and a good character. True religion has been the very basis and root principle of culture and civilization, the wellspring of "social progress, wellbeing and peace." 

 When the inner spirit of religion died away and when the clergy separated themselves from attention to the general welfare, progress ceased and decline began. History speaks clearly of the rise and fall, of the disintegration and abasement, the division, ignorance and oppression that follow in the wake of spiritual backsliding. 
                           
THE WEAKENING OF CHRISTIANITY
     Let us consider Christianity.

 After the first three or four hundred years of constant progress in transforming human life in a vast area of the world, a change in the church and in society began. A time came when the tenets of Christianity lived only within the shell of theological theories and ritual observances, while man wandered aimlessly from despair to hope, from joy to misery. Bloody wars took place between armies of the same faith; scientific facts were denied or ignored; the Inquisition, and persecution of the Jews and of the followers of Luther and of Calvin, dealt bodily blows to faith and hope. 

 In the Christian world during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the human family clamoured for some form of "political rights", as in the French Revolution and the struggle between the American colonies and the British Crown. Not alone did Christianity  abandon the path of spiritual regeneration, but IslAm did likewise. After pouring a new spiritual impulse into Europe that lifted its people out of the "dark ages", IslAm itself succumbed  to its own militant attitude of conquest and subjugation. 

 The result of this spiritual decay in both cultures was a struggle for domination and influence reaching into our century, which could have been avoided had all the religious institutions of the world prepared man for an inner belief and conviction based solely on the spiritual approach. 

 Human society after the time of Christ was widely regulated by a different order based on the now outworn system of master and serf, aristocrat and plebeian, caste, unilateral economic  practice and the like. Scientific investiga

Leaders, particularly those of Christian institutions, were caught slumbering when the first rays of light appearing on the horizon of scientific discoveries began to revolutionize the world and bring about a complete new order. Although the Renaissance of the fifteenth century heralded, after one thousand years of total darkness, the explosion to come and gave warning of the vast upheaval in the making, nevertheless, the leaders of Buddhism, of Ishm and of Christianity, missed the opportunity presented. 

 Deeply involved in the expansion and administration of their widespread domains and in the exercise of their temporal powers, they failed to see what lay ahead. They missed the opportunity to avert the catastrophic reactions which have successively beset the world for well over four hundred years. 
                          
 CIVILIZATION WITHOUT GOD  

 During the past centuries, as has already been stated, men did here and there struggle for freedom, but they found little sympathetic response or encouragement from religious institutions that held power. History teaches us that any attempt to achieve rights based on justice, freedom, truth and common interests were either opposed or denied, or drowned in blood. 

 We may say that the fundamental reason for this long and arduous struggle lay in an erroneous  conception which insidiously grew up that religion is necessary only for the salvation of the soul and that anything pertaining to human problems, such as race, politics, freedom,  social and economic needs, education, and the like, did not come within the realm of spiritual consideration. The solution of these human problems, therefore, was believed to lie outside the interests of the organized religious institutions. 

 On the other hand, governments which were revolving around the principle of absolute monarchy, in which the life, possessions  and happiness of the subject peoples were in the hands of despotic rulers, never understood  the spiritual aspect of a well-regulated, law-abiding, peaceful and harmonious society. 

 When, in the eighteenth century, a spirit of new freedom brought to birth new states and new movements, it was, however, a continuation of the Renaissance inspiration, with church and state separated by wide chasms. Even today, with a new spiritual leaven working,  it is still a "city of man," rather than a City of God, that men will be trying to build until they recognize the Source of their salvation.

 One hundred years ago Baha'u'llah presented to the whole world a set of basic principles and laws which today constitute the still unfulfilled though longed-for basis on which man can in this day found his happiness. 

 Exiled from His native land of Persia and kept a prisoner of the Turkish SultAn, Baha'u'llah was awakened by the breezes of the Holy Spirit in ample time both to foresee the revolutionary technological changes coming in the nineteenth century and to reveal a complete plan for the worldwide regeneration of mankind and the harmonious evolution of human society. 

 In His letter addressed (c. 1868) from His prison to N&siri'd-Din, the 

Sh6h of Persia, Baha'u'llah

 proclaimed: "0 king! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the knowledge of all that hat/i been. 

 This thing is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. 

 And He bade Me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what bath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow.. 

 I was indeed as one dead when His behest was uttered. 

 The hand of the will of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Mere Wul, transformed 

Me."                      

  Baha'u'llah, out of His great universal love for every living thing, formulated the broad, unassailable foundation for the establishment of a durable peace and of a veritable "Kingdom of God" on earth. The irresistible impact of His Revelation has produced unparalleled events and changes in the world since the middle of the last century. Though men may remain unaware of the Source, it is lending a "fresh impulse" and setting a "new direction" to men's hearts. World unity is the goal toward which His Revelation is moving all humanity. 

 As an element of this vast process taking place in the world, there is once again evolving


<p614>
614                THE RAILk'i WORLD

 an integration of divine law and human civilization, this time on a grand and global scale. There is also a growing realization of the function of religion as a collective influence on the mass of humanity, an influence not recognized in previous ages. Baha'u'llah's words were spoken, God's Spirit revealed, not alone for individuals for their spiritual regeneration, but to mankind as a whole — as "compo-nent  parts of one indivisible entity." 

 It is from this collective spiritual awakening that will arise a new order. 

 The world as a whole, however, except for a handful of Baha'u'llah's followers, has thus far ignored not only the application but even the acknowledgment of such a mighty Revelation, trying, selectively, to adopt some of His basic principles though roundabout and thorny measures and ignoring others. The first open recognition (not, however, officially admitted) came with the universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in Paris on December 10, 1948. (The writer, as an Observer to the United Nations from the Baha World Community, was present at that historic meeting. He also collaborated with other representatives of many NonGovernmental Organizations in the drafting of that document, at the NGO Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, in May of that same year.) 

 In recent years the head of the most powerful church in Christendom, after some lesser attempts by one or two of his predecessors, has had to admit openly the need to transfer the whole matter of "human rights" from the political-economic-social area of human activities to the more effective, nobler and loftier field of a spiritual crusade. 

 He thus has not only acknowledged but has come to support, almost word for word, what Baha'u'llah had formulated  and proclaimed a century before — a proclamation for which Baha'u'llah underwent untold  suffering, persecution and imprisonment for nearly forty years. 
                           
    "PACEM IN TERRIS"          

 It was on April 11, 1963 — while the Baha'is of the world were preparing for first the election of their supreme international body —  the Universal House of Justice in Haifa at the IBahA'i World Centre — that Pope John XXIII issued to the world his last Pastoral letter, the 

Encyclical "Pacem in Terris"
(Peace on Earth). For      

 this letter he received worldwide acclaim. (It is noteworthy that this Encyclical was addressed, for the first time in history, to "All Men of Good Will," as well as to the officials and the faithful of the church.) 

 In the light of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah, it will be of interest to quote from the official translation of this document. The headings are those of the writer, but they parallel the world unity principles of Baha'u'llah: 1.     A world community. ". 

 men are taught [by lawsJ how.. the comnmfity of all peoples should act towards each other. the establishment  of such a world community of peoples being urgently demanded today by the requirements  of universal common good... 

 "Today the universal common good poses problems of worldwide dimensions which cannot  be adequately tackled or solved except by the efforts of public authorities ... in a position to operate in an effective manner on a worldwide  basis. The moral order itself, therefore, demands that such a form of public authority be established.., 

 its purpose is to create, on a world basis, an environment in which the public authorities of each political community, its citizens. can carry out their tasks, fulfill their duties and exercise their rights with greater security." 

  2. Search after truth. 

 "Every human being has the right to freedom in searching for truth... has the right to be informed truthfully. 

 to investigate the truth freely, with the duty of seeking it and possessing it ever more completely and profoundly." 

  3. Universal education. 

 "The natural law also gives man the right to share in the benefits of culture, and therefore the right to a basic education. 

  4.     Equality between men and women."... equal rights and duties for man and woman. 

 Women have the right to working conditions in accordance with their requirements and their duties as wives and mothers. Since women are becoming ever more conscious of their human dignity, they will not tolerate being treated as mere material instruments. 
.                          
     5.     Oneness of mankind. 

 "Human society... ought to be regarded above all as a spiritual reality. 

 The order which prevails in society...


<p615>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS           615

 should be inspired and perfected by mutual love. 

 racial discrimination can in no way be justified, at least doctrinally or in theory." 

  6.     Oneness of God. "Men.., 

 are brought to a better knowledge of the true God who is personal  and transcendent, and thus they make the ties that bind them to God the solid foundations  and supreme criterions of their lives. 

 The progress of science and the inventions of technology show above all the infinite greatness of God, who created the universe and man himself" "At the present time no political community is able to pursue its own interests and develop itself in isolation, because the degree of its prosperity and development is a reflection and a component part of the degree of prosperity and development of all the other political communities." 

  11.     Obedience to rulers. 

 "When, in fact, men obey their rulers, it is not at all as men that they obey them. Through their obedience it is God, the provident Creator of all things, whom they reverence... 

  7.     Science and religion. 

 "It is not enough to be illumined with the gift of faith. And since our present age is one of outstanding scientific and technical progress and excellence, one will not be able to enter these organizations [for the public good] and work effectively from within unless he is scientifically competent, technically capable and skilled. In other words, it is necessary that human beings ... should so live and act in their temporal lives as to create a synthesis between scientific, technical and professional  elements on the one hand, and spiritual  values on the other." 

  8.     Disannarnent. "It is with deep sorrow that we note the enormous stock of armaments that have been and still are being made in the more economically developed countries with a vast outlay of intellectual and economicresources... Justice, right reason and humanity, therefore, urgently demand that.. a general agreement should eventually be reached about progressive disarmament and an effective method of control." 

  9.     Atomic energy — a warning. 

 "One must bear in mind that, even though the monstrous power of modern weapons acts as a deterrent, it is to be feared that the mere continuance of nuclear tests will have fatal consequences for life on the earth." 

  10.     Spiritual solution of the economic problem. "Human beings have the natural right to free initiative in the economic field and the right to work.. 

 and that each worker receives a wage in keeping with the laws of justice and equity... peoples should set up relationships of mutual collaboration, facilitating the circulation from one to the other of capital, goods and manpower... 

 12. The common good. "Men, however, composed as they are of bodies and immortal souls, can never in this mortal life succeed in satisfying all their needs or in attaining perfect happiness. 

 Therefore all efforts made to promote  the common good, far from endangering the eternal salvation of men, ought rather to serve to promote it." These sentiments echo the pronouncements revealed by Baha'u'llah one hundred years ago, for which He was long subjected to exile and imprisonment. 

 The full significance of His Revelation becomes clearer by a comparison of His own statements with the papal pronouncements. 

 * The following selections from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, Prophet-Founder of the Baha'i Faith, revealed in the latter ha if of the nineteenth century, are only a token selection from His voluminous Writings that deal with the social problems involved in a universal struggle for world unity, and the individual's spiritual orientation to a world in transition. 
                           
TEACHINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH   
         1. A world community.      

 "My object is none other than the betterment of the world and the tranquillity of its peoples. The wellbeing of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established. 

 This unity can never be achieved so long as the counsels which the Pen of the Most High hath revealed are suffered to pass unheeded."  (Gi. 

 286) "So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. The one true God, He Who knoweth all things, Himself testifieth 

QQ


<p616>
616                THE BAHA'I WORLD

 to the truth of these words. This goal ex-celleth every other goal, and this aspiration is the monarch of all aspirations." 

(Gi. 288)                  

 "Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. 

 The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens." 

(Gl. 250)                  

 "All nations and kindreds will be gathered together under the shadow of this Divine Banner and will become a single nation. Religious and sectarian antagonism, the hostility  of races and peoples, and differences among nations, will be eliminated. All men will adhere to one religion, will have one common faith, will be blended into one race and become a single people. All will dwell in one common fatherland, which is the planet itself.. 

 Whatsoever  is latent in the innermost of this holy Cycle shall gradually appear, and be made manifest, for now is but the beginning of its growth, and the dayspring of the revelation of its signs." (WOB 204205) 2. Search after truth. 

 ". 0 my brother, when a true seeker determines to take the step of search in the path leading to the knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must, before all else, cleanse and purify his heart, which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God, from the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge,  and the allusions of the embodiments of satanic fancy. He must purge his breast, which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the Beloved, of every defilement, and sanctify his soul from all that pertaineth to water and clay, from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments. He must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love or hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to error, or that hate repel him away from the truth. 

 Even as thou dost witness in this day how most of the people, because of such love and hate, are bereft of the immortal Face, have strayed far from the embodiments of the divine mysteries, and, shepherdless, are roaming through the wilderness of oblivion and error." 

(Iqan 192 — 193)             

 "Only when the lamp of search, of earnest striving, of longing desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love, of rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker's heart, and the breeze of His lovingkindness is wafted upon his soul, will the darkness of error be dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated, and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being." (Iqan 195 — 196. These references also in GI. 264 — 267.) 

  3.     Universal education. 

 "It is decreed that every father must educate his sons and daughters  in learning and writing and also in that which hath been ordained in the Tablet. He who neglects that which hat been commanded, if he is rich, it is incumbent on the trustees to recover from him the amount required for the education of the children; otherwise this matter shall devolve on the House of Justice. 

 Verily We have made it an asylum for the poor and needy." (B WE 200) "Bend your minds and wills to the education of the peoples and kindreds of the earth, that haply the dissensions that divide it may, through the power of the Most Great Name, be blotted out from its face, and all mankind become  the upholders of one Ord&r, and the inhabitant  of one City. ." (GL 333 — 334) "Man is the supreme Talisman. 

 Lack of a proper education hath, however, deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess. Through a word proceeding out of the mouth of God he was called into being; by one word more he was guided to recognize the Source of his education; by yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded. The Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. 

 Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom." 

(Gl. 259 — 260)              

  4.     Equality between men and women. 

 u '11Th emphasized and established the equality of man and woman. Sex is not particularized to humanity; it exists throughout the animate kingdoms but without distinction or preference. 

 •Is it becoming to man that he, the noblest of creatures, should observe and insist upon such distinction? 

 Woman's lack of progress and proficiency has been due to her need of equal education and opportunity. Had she been allowed this equality there is no doubt she would be the counterpart of man in ability and capacity. 

 The happiness of mankind will be realized when women and men coordinate and advance equally, for each is the complement and helpmeet of the other." 

(B WE 241)

  5. Oneness of mankind. "Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. 

 Deal ye one with another with the utmost love and harmony. 

." (GA 288)                    

 "Adam, the parent of mankind [symboli-cally],  may be likened to the tree of nativity upon which you are the leaves and blossoms. Inasmuch as your origin was one, you must now be united and agreed; you must consort with each other in joy and fragrance. 

 man must recognize the oneness of humanity, for all in origin belong to the same household and all are servants to the same God." (B WE 233) "We have erewhile declared — and Our Word is the truth — : 'Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.'  Whatsoever bath led the children of men to shun one another, and bath caused dissensions  and divisions amongst them, hath, through the revelation of these words, been nullified and abolished. The summons and the message which We gave were never intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto true liberty... 

 Behold how the generality of mankind  bath been endued with the capacity to hearken unto God's most exalted Word — the Word upon which must depend the gathering together and spiritual resurrection of all men.. 

 ." (GJ. 95 — 97) "Naught but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing the divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas and convictions of the children of men." 

(WOB 42)                       

 "0 ye children of men, the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard theinterests and promote  the unity of the human race.. This is the straight Path, the fixed and immovable foundation. 

 Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure." 

           (GA 215)                       

  6. Oneness of God. "Beware, beware, lest thou be led to join partners with the Lord, thy God. He is, and hath from everlasting been, one and alone, without peer or equal, eternal in the past, 617 eternal in the future, detached from all things, ever-abiding, unchangeable, and self-subsist-ing. 

 Bear thou witness in thine inmost heart unto this testimony which God bath Himself and for Himself pronounced, that there is none other God but Him, that all else besides Him have been created by His behest, have been fashioned by His leave, are subject to His law, are as a thing forgotten when compared to the glorious evidences of His oneness, and are as nothing when brought face to face with the mighty revelations of His unity." (GI. 192 — 193) "Regard thou the one true God as One Who is apart from, and immeasurably exalted above, all created things. 

 The whole universe reflecteth His glory, while He is I-Iimself independent of, and transcendeth His creatures. This is the true meaning of Divine unity. 

He Who is the Eternal Truth    

 is the one Power Who exerciseth undisputed  sovereignty Over the world of being, Whose image is reflected in the mirror of the entire creation. 

 All existence is dependent upon Rim, and from Him is derived the source of the sustenance of all things. This is what is meant by Divine unity; this is its fundamental princi-pie." 

(GA 166)                       

  7.     Science and religion. "Knowledge is like unto wings for the being, and is as a ladder for ascending. To acquire knowledge is incumbent on all, but of those sciences which may profit the people of the earth, and not such sciences as begin in mere words, and end in mere words." 

          (BWF 189)                      

 "To study sciences and arts of all descriptions  is allowable; but such sciences as are profitable, which lead and conduce to the elevation of mankind." 

(BWF 195)                      

 "The fourth teaching of Baha'u'llah is the agreement of religion and science. God has endowed man with intelligence and reason whereby he is required to determine the verity of questions and propositions. 

 If religious beliefs  and opinions are found contrary to the standards of science they are mere superstitions and imaginations; for the antithesis of knowledge  is ignorance, and the child of ignorance is superstition. Unquestionably there must be agreement between true religion and science..." 

          (B WE 240)                     

  8. Disarmament. "0 kings of the earth! We see you increasing every year your expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on your subjects.


<p618>
618                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 This, verily, is wholly and grossly unjust. 
     "0 rulers of the earth!    

 Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no more armaments  save in a measure to safeguard your territories and dominions." (Gi. 

 253 — 254) "Compose your differences, and reduce your armaments, that the burden of your expenditures  may be lightened; and that your minds and hearts may be tranquilized. 

 Heal the dissensions that divide you, and ye will no longer be in need of any armaments except what the protection of your cities and territories demand-eth.  Fear ye God, and take heed not to outstrip the bounds of moderation, and be numbered among the extravagant. ." (Gi. 

 250 — 251) "The time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally  realized. 

 The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world's Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace demandeth that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the tranquillity of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves. Should any king take up arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him. 

 If this be done, the nations of the world will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories. This will ensure the peace and composure of every people, government and nation   (GI. 249) 9. Atomic energy — a warning. 

 "A strange and wonderful instrument exists in the earth; but it is concealed from minds and souls. 

 It is an instrument which has the power to change the atmosphere of the whole earth, and its infection causes destruction." 

(AWE 183)                  

  10.     Spiritual solution of the economic problem. 

 "They who are possessed of riches... must have the utmost regard for the poor, for great is the honour destined by God for those poor who are steadfast in patience. 

 Please God, the poor may exert themselves and strive to earn the means of livelihood. This is a duty which, in this most great Revelation, hath been prescribed unto every one, and is accounted in the sight of God as a goodly deed." (BWF13O —  131) "It is made incumbent on every one of you to engage in some one occupation, such as arts, trades, and the like. We have made this — your occupation — identical with the worship of God, the True One... Waste not your time in idleness and indolence, and occupy yourselves with that which will profit yourselves and others beside yourself. 

 Thus bath the matter been decreed in this Tablet from the horizon of which the sun of wisdom and divine utterance is gleaming! The most despised of men before God is he who sitsandbegs.. 

." (BWF 195)               

  11.     Obedience to rulers. 

 "A king whom the pride of authority and independence does not withhold from being just, and whom benefits, opulence, glory, hosts and legions do not deprive of the splendours of the orb of equity —  such a king shall possess a lofty station and an exalted rank in the Supreme Concourse: it is incumbent on all to assist and love such a blessed being. ." (BWF 181) "In every country or government where any of this community reside, they must behave toward that government with faithfulness, trustfulness and truthfulness." (BWF 192) 12. The common good. "0 people of God! Do not busy yourselves with your own concerns let your thoughts be fixed upon that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the hearts and souls of men. It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold fast unto whatsoever will promote the interests, and exalt the station, of all nations and just governments.. 

 ." (GJ. 93 — 95) "All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization. To act like the beasts of the field is unworthy of man." (Gi. 215) "Address yourselves to the promotion of the wellbeing and tranquility of the children of men. Bend your minds and wills to the education  of the peoples and kindreds of the earth, that haply the dissensions that divide it may, through the power of the Most Great Name, be blotted out from its face, and all mankind become the upholders of one Order, and the inhabitants of one City. Ye dwell in one world and have been created through the operation of one Will. Blessed is he who mingleth with all men in a spirit of utmost kindliness and love." (Gi. 333 — 334) "The wellbeing of mankind, its peace and

  security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established." 

(GZ. 286)                  

 "0 ye the elected representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel together, and let your concern be oniy for that which profiteth mankind, and bettereth the condition thereof.. Regard ye the world as the human body which, though at its creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with grave disorders and maladies... That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith."

620              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ~. THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH
    Part of a commentary by the renowned scholar

          'Abdu'1-Hamid-i-Ishr~iq KhAvari

  Translated and adapted by IJabib TAhirzAdih THE mightiest proof of the greatness of Baha'u'llah and of the transcendental character of His divine mission lies in His Writings which streamed from Ills Pen like a torrential rain during a period of no less than forty years of uninterrupted revelation. 

 History clearly shows that Baha'u'llah never attended a school and that the tuition He received at home after the fashion of the nobility at that time was but rudimentary. 

 In His Epistle to the Sh6.h of Persia, Baha'u'llah writes these challenging words: "The learning current amongst men I studied not: their schools I entered not. Ask of the city wherein I dwelt, that thou inayest be well assured that Jam not of them who speak falsely." 

  When we look at the surging ocean of Baha'u'llah's Writings against a background of a life of suffering, imprisonment, privation and manifold calamities, we are amazed at the vastness, the range and the rare quality of this priceless heritage which He has bequeathed to posterity. 

 Indeed no human mind can chart the extent or fathom the depths of this immense ocean or appreciate the true value and significance  of those myriads of priceless gems which are enshrined in it. One striking feature of 

Baha'u'llah's Writings    

 is its prodigious flow. We know for instance that the whole book of Iqan was revealed within the short space of two days during the last year of His stay in Baghd~id. Commenting on the copious outpouring of His Writings Shoghi Effendi affirms in God 

Passes                    
By:                       

 "A certain Mubammad Karim, a native of ShfrAz, who had been a witness to the rapidity and the manner in which the DAb had penned the verses with which He was inspired, has left the following testimony to posterity, after attaining, during those days, the presence of Baha'u'llah, and beholding with his own eyes what he himself had considered to be the oniy proof of the mission of the Promised One: 'I bear witness that the verses revealed by Baha'u'llah were superior, in the rapidity with which they were penned, in the ease with which they flowed, in their lucidity, their profundity and sweetness to those which I, myself, saw pour from the pen of the Bab when in His presence. Had Baha'u'llah no other claim to greatness, this were sufficient, in the eyes of the world and its people, that He produced such verses as have streamed this day from His pen.~ 

 And further on he writes: "'Day and night,' an eyewitness has written, 'the Divine verses were raining down in such number that it was impossible to record them. Mirza AqA JAn wrote them as they were dictated, while the Most Great Branch was continually occupied in transcribing them. There was not a moment to spare.' 'A number of secretaries,' Nabf 1 has testified, 'were busy day and night and yet they were unable to cope with the task. 

 Among them was Mirza B6qir-i-ShirAzL..  He alone transcribed no less than two thousand verses every day. lie laboured during six or seven months. Every month the equivalent of several volumes would be transcribed by him and sent to Persia. 

 About twenty volumes, in his fine penmanship, he left behind as a remembrance for Mirza AqA JAn.' Baha'u'llah, Himself, referring to the verses revealed by Him, has written: 'Such are the outpourings.. 

 from the clouds of Divine Bounty that within the space of an hour tire equivalent of a thousand verses kwh been revealed.' 

 'So great is the grace vouchsafed in this day that in a single day and night, were an amanuensis capable of accomplishing it to be found, the equivalent of the Persian Baydn would be sent down from the heaven of Divine holiness.' 

 'Iswear by God!' He, in another connection has affirmed, 'In those days the equivalent of alithat kwh been sent down aforetime unto the Prophets bath been revealed.' 'That which bath already been revealed in this

 land (Adrianople),' He, furthermore, referring to the copiousness of His writings, has declared, 'secretaries are incapable of transcribing. 

 It has, therefore, remained for the most part untrans-cribed."' In The Baha'i World volumes there is a list of some one hundred and fifty of the bestknown works of Baha'u'llah which were revealed in the form of books, epistles and Tablets. 

 But this list is by no means exhaustive; it barely covers a portion of His Writings. In order to get a fair idea of their scope and vastness we ought also to take into account: 

1. Thousands of Tablets   

 of varying length, ranging from a few lines to numerous pages which were addressed to individual believers in Persia and other neighbouring countries. 

  2. The vast amount of His original Writings which have been lost to posterity either though ill-preservation, or because they fell into wrong hands, or were destroyed by enemies, or obliterated by Baha'u'llah's own instruction. Concerning the fate of the last portion, Shoghi Effendi quotes Nabil's testimony as follows: "No less an authority than Mirza Aqd JAn, Baha'u'llah's amanuensis, affirms, as reported by Nabil, that by the express order of Baha'u'llah, hundreds of thousands of verses, mostly written by His own hand, were obliterated and cast into the river. 

 'Finding me reluctant to execute His orders,' Mirza AqA JAn has related to Nabf 1, 'Baha'u'llah would reassure me saying: "None is to be found at this time worthy to hear these melodies. 

 ." Not once, or twice, but innumerable  times, was I commanded to repeat this act."' 3. Baha'u'llah's unrecorded utterances which rained down so profusely that the secretaries could not cope with their recording. 
Again the Guardian invokes

Nabil:                    

 "So prolific was this period, that during the first two years after His return from His retirement, according to the testimony of Nabil, who was at that time living in Baglid~d the unrecorded verses that streamed from His lips averaged, in a single day and night, the equivalent of the Qur'an!" 

  As to the immensity of the field of Baha'u'llah's Writings we would do well to refer to Shoghi Effendi's comments in God Passes By: "With this book (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf) revealed about one year prior to His ascension, the prodigious achievement as author of a hundred volumes, repositories of the priceless pearls of His Revelation, may be said to have practically terminated — volumes replete with unnumbered exhortations, revolutionizing  principles, world-shaping laws and ordinances, dire warnings and portentous prophecies, with soul-uplifting prayers and meditations, illuminating commentaries and interpretations, impassioned discourses and homilies, all interspersed with either addresses or references to kings, to emperors and to ministers, of both the East and the West, to ecciesiastics of divers denominations, and to leaders in the intellectual, political, literary, mystical, commercial and humanitarian spheres of human activity." 

   Baha'u'llah's Writings    

 are profound, and peerless in eloquence. They are lavishly sprinkled with symbolic expressions and vibrate with a spiritual potency that no pure-hearted seeker can fail to discern. 

 They are revealed in Persian and Arabic in a style and language which are unique and unrivalled in every sense. Unbiased scholars of the Persian and Arabic tongues readily recognize Baha'u'llah's Writings as a novel creation, quite distinct in wording and expression from the conventional literary styles used until then by any known writer. Indeed a casual study of these Writings would suffice to convince the unprejudiced reader that the Author must have been divinely inspired and that His knowledge and wisdom were innate and not scholastic. Needless to say, many seekers after truth who had a literary bent of mind readily embraced the Cause soon after perusing some passages from the Writings of Baha'u'llah. 

 In the following pages an attempt is made to give a brief description of some of the wellknown 

Works of Baha'u'llah     

 which were revealed before His declaration in 1863 and up to the time of His arrival in 'Akka in 1868. These Writings are dealt with in chronological order following the path of His journey —  TibrAn, BaghdAd, SulaymAniyyih, Bagj~dAd, Constantinople and Adrianople. A few of these works have been translated into English by the beloved Guardian; others he has referred to in his writings, chiefly

622                 THE BAHA'I WORLD
      RASHIJ-I-'AMA              

 This wondrous poem was revealed by Baha'u'llah in TibrAn before He was exiled to 'IrAq, and is regarded as the first intimation of the stirring of the Spirit of God within His Soul. 

 The language used in this poem is full of ecstasy and exultation and contains many veiled and figurative terms such as: "the hidden ocean", "the musk-laden breeze", "the Maid of heaven", "the Day of God", "the dawn of the revelation of I am He", "the warbling of the Dove", "the living waters of God", "the wondrous Beauty", which are but the effusions of that billowing ocean of divine Revelation which surged and swelled within His inner Being, though it was still hidden from the eyes of men. 
                           
 TABLET OF KULLU'T-TA'AM    
     This is one of the outstanding

Tablets of Baha'u'llah     

 revealed in the year 1854, soon after His banishment to 'Iitq. It is rather long and written in exquisite Arabic. In a passage in God Passes By Shoghi Effendi describes the circumstances  which led to the revelation of this eloquent and illuminating commentary. The passage runs as follows: "The circumstances leading to the revelation of the Tablet of KuIlu'f-jj'a'dm, written during that period, at the request of IJAji Mirza KamAlu'd-Din-i-Natitqi, a Bab of honorable rank and high culture, could not but aggravate a situation that had already become serious and menacing. 

 Impelled by a desire to receive illumination from Mirza Ya~y~i concerning the meaning of the Qur'Anic verse 'All food was allowed to the children of Israel,' 

Igji Mirza KamAlu'd-Din    

 had requested him to write a commentary upon it — a request which was granted, but with reluctance and in a manner which showed such incompetence and superficiality  as to disillusion 156J1 Mirza KamAlu'd-Din,  and to destroy his confidence in its author. Turning to Baha'u'llah and repeating his request, he was honored by a Tablet, in which Israel and his children were identified with the Bab and His followers respectively — a Tablet which by reason of the allusions it contained, the beauty of its language and the cogency of its argument, so enraptured the soul of its recipient that he would have, but for the restraining hand of Baha'u'llah, proclaimed forthwith his discovery of God's hidden Secret in the person of the One Who had revealed it." Apart from the numerous interpretations of the terms "Israel" and "children of Israel", Baha'u'llah defines in this Tablet the qualities and attributes with which every seeker after truth must be endowed, dwells on the wrongs and afflictions He endured both at the hand of His foes and through the vile conduct of His friends, and alludes, in no ambiguous terms, to the imminent fulfilment of the Will of God amongst men. Another significant feature of this Tablet is that in it Baha'u'llah confers the exalted title of "The Last Point" upon Quddfls. 
     On receiving this inspiring

Tablet iThii Mirza Kamilu'd-Din

 became an ardent admirer of Baha'u'llah and later, when lie declared  His mission, he distinguished himself as a devoted follower of the Faith. His name is immortalized by a number of Tablets Baha'u'llah  '11Th revealed in his honour. 

 It is interesting to note that at the time of Baha'u'llah's departure from BaghdAd, when He was actually leaving His house for the last time amidst the wailing and weeping of the Bab's, it was this same KamM who, overwhelmed  by grief and despondency, was moved to offer his infant son as a ransom, by placing him at the feet of Baha'u'llah. 

 The little child shriekingly grasped the hem of His garment with his tiny hands and made a piognant gesture which clearly meant he was begging Him not to leave. Baha'u'llah Himself confirms  this incident in a Tablet which was revealed soon after His declaration: "He (Baha'u'llah) observed at His feet a suckling, withdrawn from the breast of his mother, grasp the sacred Hem with beseeching fingers and call to Him in a weak voice." 

 It should be noted, moreover, that IJ~ji Mirza KamAl's great-grandfather was the wellknown  MuLJA Mihdi, one of the leading Muslim clergy during the reign of Fath 'Au SliTh (179 8 —  1834). He is the author of the book entitled Muhriqu'l-Qulab, which contains a stirring account of the episode of KarbilA and the martyrdom of ImAm Ifjlusayn. This is the same book parts of which were read aloud to the Bab every morning by His amanuensis during his period of incarceration, and in Nabil's words: ..... its recital would provoke intense emotion in the heart of the Bab and his tears would keep flowing as He listened to that tale." IjlAji Mirza

   SAQI AZ GIIAYB-I-BAQA      

 Another outpouring of divine grace which streamed from the Pen of Baha'u'llah during His retirement to the mountains of Sulay-mAnfyyih is this soul-entrancing ode in Persian which exhibits a rare beauty. The whole poem is full of veiled and symbolic terms which unmistakably  hint at llisforthcoming 

Revelation. Shoghi Effendi 

 alludes to this point in these words: "These initial and impassioned outpourings  of a Soul struggling to unburden itself, in the solitude of a self-imposed exile (many of them, alas lost to posterity) are, with the Tablet of Kullu't-Ta'dm and the poem entitled Raslzh-i-'Amd revealed in Tih~n, the first fruits of His divine Pen." 

 The opening couplet of the above ode runs as follows: Rend asunder Thy veil, 0 Cupbearer of the invisible eternity! So that from the Face of the All-Glorious, Imay quaff the wine of immortality. All the wine in thy store can scarce allay the ardour of my love: pour out for me an ocean of thy mystic wine! 

  And further on occurs this verse which is familiar to many of the friends: If tlzine aim be to cherish thy life, approach not our Court: but if sacrifice be thy heart's desire, come and let others come with thee. For such is the way of Faith, if in thy heart thou seekest reunion with Baha: shouldyt thou refuse to tread this path, why trouble Us, begone! 
                           
  QASIDIY-I-VARQA'IYYJT{     

 This wonderful ode is endowed with much beauty and power. 

 It comprises a series of thoughtprovoking verses in Arabic and was revealed by Baha'u'llah during the period of His retirement to the mountains of Kurdist~n in the year 1854 — 5. 

    In God Passes By Shoghi    

 Effendi describes how Baha'u'llah was prompted to reveal this poem at the request of a delegation of eminent doctors and distinguished scholars of KurdistAn: "Amazed by the profundity of His insight and the compass of His understanding, they were impelled to seek from Him what they considered to be a conclusive and final evidence of the unique power and knowledge which lie now appeared in their eyes to possess. 'No one among the mystics, the wise, and the learned,' they claimed, while requesting this further favor from Him, 'has hitherto proved himself capable of writing a poem in a rhyme and meter identical with that of the longer of the two odes, entitled QayiJy-i-Td'iyyih composed by lint-i-FdricL We beg you to write for us a poem in that same meter and rhyme.' This request was complied with, and no less than two thousand verses, in exactly the manner they had specified, were dictated by Him, out of which He selected one hundred and twenty-seven, which He permitted them to keep, deeming the subject matter of the rest premature and unsuitable to the needs of the times. It is these same one hundred and twenty-seven verses that constitute the Qayidiy-i-Varqd'iyyili, so familiar to, and widely circulated amongst His Arabic speaking followers." 

 The theme of this inspiring poem, portrayed in symbolic terms, is the advent of the Promised Day and the release of the quickening power of the Spirit of God in this age. Referring to the same poem, Shoghi Effendi affirms that it was revealed "in praise of the Maiden personifying the Spirit of God recently descended upon Him." In a passage of this verse Baha'u'llah also gives vent to the "agonies of His sorrow-laden  heart" in these words: Noah's flood is but the measure of the tears I have shed, and Abraham's fire an ebullition of My soul. 

 Jacob's grief is but a reflection of My sorrows, and Job's afflictions a fraction of My calamity. 
                           
     THE HIDDEN WORDS           

 The Hidden Words is another wellknown work of Baha'u'llah which was revealed in Baghddd before His Declaration in 1863. It is unique in style and captivating in eloquence and power of appeal. 

     In God Passes By Shoghi    

 Effendi extols the exalted character of this work in these words: "Next to this unique repository of inestimable  treasures (the Iqan) must rank that marvellous  collection of gemlike utterances, The Hidden Words with which Baha'u'llah was inspired, as He paced, wrapped in His medita

 tions, the banks of the Tigris. Revealed in the year 1274 A.H., partly in Persian, partly in Arabic, it was originally designated The Hidden Book of Fd.timih and was identified by its Author with the Book of that same name, believed by Shi'ah IslAm to be in the possession of the promised Q&im, and to consist of words of consolation addressed by the angel Gabriel, at God's command, to F~timih, and dictated to the Im~m 'Au, for the sole purpose of comforting her in her hour of bitter anguish after the death of her illustrious Father. 

 The significance  of this dynamic spiritual leaven cast into the life of the world for the reorientation of the minds of men, the edification of their souls and the rectification of their conduct can best be judged by the description of its character given in the opening passage by its Author: "This is that which hath descended from the Realm of Glory, uttered by the tongue ofpower and might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old. We have taken the inner essence thereof and clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a token of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto the Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust, and in the realm of spirit obtain the gem of Divine virtue." 
   In the vast field of Baha'u'llah's

Writings, The Hidden Words 

 stands out forever as a shining beacon shedding the light of divine guidance upon thepathofawaywardliumanity. 
                           
       KITAB-J-IQAN               
 (The Book of Certitude)    

 The Iqan bears ample testimony to the greatness  and divine knowledge of Baha'u'llah and is an outstanding landmark in the vast field of His Writings. 

 Plunging into this inexhaustible fountain of divine Truth one can find explicit answers to many questions which have, for centuries, perplexed the minds of men. 

 Concerning the revelation as well as the contents of this masterpiece of literary beauty and eloquence, Shoghi Effendi writes in God Passes By: "Foremost among the priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of 

Baha'u'llah's  Revelation  

 ranks the Kitdb-i-lqdn (Book of Certitude), revealed within the space of two days and two nights, in the closing years of that period (1278 A.H. — A.D. 1862). It was written in fulfillment of the prophecy of the BAt, Who had specifically stated that the Promised One would complete the text of the unfinished Persian Bay[in, and in reply to the questions addressed to Baha'u'llah by the as yet unconverted maternal uncle of the 

Bab, lidji Mirza Siyyid    

 Mutiammad, while on a visit, with his brother, $Aji Mirza Uasan-'Ali, to KarbilA. 

 A model of Persian prose, of a style at once original, chaste and vigorous, and remarkably lucid, both cogent in argument and matchless in its irresistible eloquence, this Book setting forth in outline the 

Grand Redemptive Scheme    

 of God, occupies a position unequalled by any work in the entire range of Baha'i literature, except the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Baha'u'llah's 

Most Holy Book. Revealed   

 on the eve of the declaration of His Mission, it proffered to mankind the 'Choice Sealed Wine', whose seal is of 'musk', and broke the 'seals' of the 'Book' referred to by Daniel, and disclosed the meaning of the 'words' destined to remain 'closed up' till the 'time of the end'. 

 "Within a compass of two hundred pages it proclaims unequivocally the existence and oneness  of a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty; asserts the relativity of religious truth and the continuity of Divine Revelation; affirms the unity of the Prophets, the universality of their Message, the identity of their fundamental teachings, the sanctity of their scriptures, and the twofold character of their stations; denounces  the blindness and perversity of the divines and doctors of every age; cites and elucidates the allegorical passages of the New Testament, the abstruse verses of the Qur'an, and the cryptic Mubammadan traditions which have bred those agelong misunderstandings, doubts and animosities that have sundered and kept apart the followers of the world's leading religious systems; enumerates the essential prerequisites for the attainment by every true seeker of the object of his quest; demonstrates the validity, the sublimity and significance of the DAb's Revelation; acclaims the heroism and detachment of His disciples; foreshadows, and prophesies the worldwide triumph of the Revelation promised to the people of the Bay&n; upholds the purity and innocence of the Virgin Mary; glorifies the Lmgms of the Faith of Mubammad; celebrates the martyrdom, and lauds the spiritual sovereignty, of the

 ImAm Ijusayn; unfolds the meaning of such symbolic terms as 'Return', 'Resurrection', 'Seal of the Prophets' and 'Day of Judgment'; adumbrates and distinguishes between the three stages of Divine Revelation; and expatiates, in glowing terms, upon the glories and wonders of the 'City of God', renewed, at fixed intervals, by the dispensation of Providence, for the guidance, the benefit and salvation of all mankind. Well may it be claimed that of all the books revealed by the Author of the Baha'i Revelation, this Book alone, by sweeping away the agelong barriers that have so insurmountably separated the great religions of the world, has laid down a broad and unassailable foundation  for the complete and permanent reconciliation of their followers." 

 This "priceless treasure" to which Baha'u'llah subsequently gave the title of Iqan (Certitude) was originally known among the early believers as "Epistle to the Uncle (of the Blab)", since it was his request for elucidation regarding some specific questions which prompted Baha'u'llah to reveal this book. 

 The questions he had asked were closely linked with the coming of the Promised Q&im, such as the following: The fulfillment of specific signs The question of Mubammad being considered  as the last of the Prophets The resurrection of the dead The sovereignty of the

       FOUR VALLEYS               
     Baha'u'llah's Seven Valleys

 is a monumental work in the realm of mystical thought. Shoghi Effendi refers to it as "a treatise that may well be regarded as His greatest mystical composition  which He wrote in answer to the questions of $haykfi Muliyi'd-Din, the QAQI of ~h~niqayn, in which lie describes the seven stages which the soul of the seeker must needs traverse crc it can attain the object of its existence." 

 This profound essay opens up a new outlook on life and brings abiding delight to the heart of many a seeker after truth, The story is one of a lover who, despite much suffering and hardship,  trudges through mystic valleys in his eager search for the One Who is the Object of his quest. The valleys referred to in the text are those of: Search, Love, Knowledge, Unity, Contentment, 

Wonder, True Poverty       

 and Absolute Selflessness, each of which has been described in this treatise. 

 The Four Valleys is a sister essay to the former. 

 It is revealed in the same mystical language and is full of charm and food for thought. 

 ft streamed from the Pen of RaM-'u'11&h  some time after the Seven Valleys had been revealed, and is addressed to Shaykh 'Abdu'r-RabmAn-i-KarkPti, a learned Siif I of that period. In it Baha'u'llah traces out four paths, namely: Spirit, Reason, Love and the Realm of Conscience, by which the ardent lover may set out on his spiritual journey to the court of the Beloved. 

 These two essays are unique among the Writings of Baha'u'llah and their perusal serves immensely to enhance one's capacity for meditation and spirituad perception. 
                           
     TABLET OF THE HOLY MARINER 

  This is one of the weightiest emanations from the Pen of Baha'u'llah. In it He hints at the ominous happenings which then loomed on the horizon and foreshadows the approach of a period of apprehension and grave anxiety. Expatiating on the circumstances which prevailed  at the time when this Tablet was revealed  Shoghi Effendi writes: "It was on the fifth of Nawruz (1863), while Bah ft'u'llAh was celebrating the festival in the Mazra'iy-i-Vash6sh in the outskirts of Bagfid~d and had just revealed the Tablet of the Holy Marincir, whose gloomy prognostications had aroused the grave apprehensions of His companions, that an emissary of NAmiq P&,h~ arrived and delivered into His hands a communication requesting an interview between Him and the governor. 

 "Already, as Nabil has pointed out in his narrative, Baha'u'llah had, in the course of His discourses, during the last years of His


<p626>
626                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 sojourn in BaglidAd, alluded to the period of trial and turmoil that was inexorably approaching,  exhibiting a sadness and heaviness of heart which greatly perturbed those around 

Him."                      

 And further on: "'Oceans of sorrow,' Nabil affirms, 'surged in the hearts of the listeners when the Tablet of the Holy Mariner was read aloud to them... It was evident to every one that the chapter of Baglid6d was about to be closed, and a new one opened, in its stead. No sooner had that Tablet been chanted than Baha'u'llah ordered that the tents which had been pitched should be folded up, and that all His companions should return to the city. 

 While the tents were being removed He observed: "These tents may be likened to the trappings of this world, which no sooner are they spread out than the time comet/i for them to be rolled up." From these words of His they who heard them perceived that these tents would never again be pitched on that spot. They had not yet been taken away when the messenger arrived from Eag~dAd to deliver the aforementioned communication from the governor."' 

     LAWII-J-HURIYYJH           

 (Tablet of the Maiden) This is yet another matchless outpouring from the Pen of Baha'u'llah in which, as affinned by the beloved Guardian, "events of a far remoter future are foreshadowed." 

 This Tablet is wholly in Arabic and begins with these words: "In the Name of God, the 

Most Holy, the Most Exalted!

 Praise be to Thee, 0 Lord, my God. I make mention of Thee at this moment when Thy divine Luminary hat/i risen above the horizon of the sacred Mount of Thy celestial realm c/oneness." 

  The main part of this Tablet is couched in figurative language, depicting a wondrous Maiden who embodies the Most Great Spirit. 
                           
       SURIY-I-SAiBR              
    (Sdrih of Patience)        

  This lengthy Epistle, also known as the Sfirih of Ayy6b (Job) was revealed by Baha'u'llah on the first day of RiQv&i 1863. The whole Sarili is written in Arabic. It is highly eloquent in style and vibrant with power and glory. In it, among other things, Baha'u'llah refers to the woeful episode of Nayriz and praises in glowing terms the heroism and fortitude of ValMd and the company of his fellow-sufferers. The recipient of this mighty Epistle is none other than the indomitable, the longsuffering H' Mubammad Taqi who bore heroically, over a long period, horrible tortures beyond human endurance. 

 Ij&ji Mubammad Taqi was one of the wealthiest natives of Nayriz, famous for his honesty and noble character. When the Bab declared His mission in 1844, he embraced the new Faith and became one of its ardent followers. 

 At the outbreak of the Nayriz upheaval in 1850, lThji Muhammad Taqi threw in his lot with the defenders of the Fort of Kh~jih near Nayriz, and during the whole period of siege, which lasted no less than four months, he acted as the host, furnishing unstintingly from his own resources all the food and provisions needed for the subsistence of his besieged companions. This vital contribution, together with the daring deeds whereby he managed to get the supplies into the fort in the teeth of enemy vigilance and opposition, made zaynu'1-'Abidin KhAn, the fanatical governor of Nayriz, so furious that he vowed to wreak his vengeance upon him as soon as the EThis had surrendered. Later when, through enemy treachery, the evacuation of the fort took place, tiAji Mubammad Taqi was delivered into the hands of the ruthless governor,  who imprisoned him in a dungeon and tortured him daily for nearly a year. 

 The nature of the torture the governor had prescribed for this victim is too shocking to contemplate. 

 Every morning, even on cold, winter days, he was stripped of clothing, then cast into the pooi in the courtyard, while a number of guards stood around the pool and thrashed him mercilessly with rods until the water was tinged red with his blood and the victim was in a state of collapse. Mter a short time, the sight of the havoc wrought upon his body through this daily torture was frightful. His head and shoulders were a mass of blood and swollen flesh, while his face was wholly disfigured beyond recognition. Sometimes, with his ghastly wounds exposed, he was paraded through the bazaars and along the streets at the head of a shouting and jeering crowd, while his jailers were busily engaged in

 extorting money from the awestruck shopkeepers and passersby. 

 The story of how IiAji Mu1~ammad Taqi was miraculously rescued from jail is part of Baha'i history. 

 It remains to be said that he eventually went to Yazd where by the grace of God his wounds gradually healed and he was later able to go on foot to Baghd~td where he attained the presence of Baha'u'llah not long before His declaration in 1863.

OF THE                     
          QUR'AN                     

 This lengthy Epistle, revealed in Arabic, is profound. 

 it enshrines many pearls of divine reality and unfolds the meaning of a number of symbolic terms and passages, including various interpretations of the disconnected letters Alif, LAm, Mim, which occur at the commencement of the second Si~irih of the Qur'an. Moreover, the commentary on the figurative passage in the Qur'an which begins with the words "AIIdh is the light of the heaven and of the earth" is highly illuminating. 

 In this Epistle Baha'u'llah also expatiates on the significance and use of certain elements and makes reference to the substance known as "elixir andthephilosoplzer's stone". 

 This Epistle was revealed by Baha'u'llah in Bagiid~d in reply to questions put to Him by one of the followers of the BTh, named Mirza Aq6y-i-Rik~b-SAz who was eventually martyred in Shfr~iz with two other 

B~bis. Shoghi Effendi      

 in God Passes By refers to this episode in these words: "In Shfr~iz Mirza Aq6.y-i-RikAb-S~iz, together  with Mirza Rafi'-i-Khayy~t and Mash-bach  Nabi, were by order of the local muitahid simultaneously strangled in the dead of night, their graves being later desecrated by a mob who heaped refuse upon them." 

 The muitahid who condemned the above believers to death was named Shaykh 

Uusayn-i-N~im,  whom Baha'u'llah
stigmatized as "the tyrant".
                           
LAWU-I-MADINATU'T-TAWJJJD  
(Tablet of the City of     

Unity)                     

 Within the pages of this enthralling Tablet Baha'u'llah proclaims the oneness of God, describes some of His transcendent attributes and affirms that no one can ever attain to His knowledge save by recognizing those who are the Bearers of His Message and the Repositories of His celestial wisdom and glory. The opening verse of this Tablet runs as follows: "This is the City of Divine Unity. Enter ye therein, 0 concourse of the believers in divine unity, so that ye may, through heavenly tidings, be numbered among those who rejoice with exceeding gladness." 

  From the latter part of this Tablet is wafted the vivifying breeze of the coming Springtime. Here Baha'u'llah gives, in clear and thrilling language, the tidings of the approaching hour of His Revelation. 

 One passage reads: "Hearken unto the Day when the Herald raiseth His Call in the midmost heart of the immortal realm, when the Dove of IcIiPz warbkth from the land of 'Irdq summoning all unto concord,  and when the gate of heaven is flung open before the face of the entire creation. 

 This is the Day that shall not be overtaken by the gloom of night, as the sun receiveth its light therefrom, inasmuch as this Day is illumined by the splendour  of His radiant face. By the righteousnes.v of God! 

 At that moment a holy and new earth is spread out at the behest of God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Inaccessible." 

 The recipient of this beautiful Tablet was the devoted Shaykli Sa1ni~n of Hindiy~in in southern 

Persia, Baha'u'llah's      

 trusted and high-spirited courier during the whole period of His ministry. 

 He also continued his services during the days of the Master until lie passed away in Shir6z after a lifelong period of Unexcelled  devotion and sacrifice. 

 When Baha'u'llah was exiled to Baghd64 in 1852, SaIm6n was the first follower of the Bab to enter His presence. Once he asked Him for some explanations about the oneness of God and how one could reach Him and know Him. In reply, Baha'u'llah revealed this soul-uplift-ing Tablet in his honour. 

  ~AUIFIY-I-SHAfliYYiH In this inspiring, lengthy Tablet Baha'u'llah demonstrates the invincible power of the Cause of God. He asserts that no matter how formidable  the reverses it might suffer in the future it is nevertheless endowed with a power such as to surmount every crisis and tear down every

 obstacle that stands in its way. It is simply undefeatable.  lit forges ahead victoriously from strength to strength until its glorious mission is wholly consummated. Dwelling on this subject, Baha'u'llah likens the irresistible march of the Faith to a great river (hence the title Sakifiy-i-Sha((iyyih meaning river-like) which when in flood carries everything before it. He portrays this point in these words: "Behold the flow of this river which we see before Us. When torrential and swollen it rolletli on and surgeth forward. 

 Whatever coarse it taketh, it is irresistible in its might. It taketli no notice of the hue and cry the populace raise, shouting: 'The great dyke hath burst', or 'the embankment is flooded', or 'the house is ruined', or 'the palace is devastated'. 

 Unconcerned it rusheth on pursuing its path with vehement fury and force and with overwhelming strength and ma]esty." 
                          
     MUSIBAT-J-HUROFAT-I-'ALIYAT
     (The Calamities of the    

Letters of Loftiness)     

 A stream of sadness runs through this Tablet as Baha'u'llah dramatically depicts the transitory nature of this earthly life and brings home to one's mind, in graphic manner, the important fact that there is no refuge for man save through submission to the inscrutable Will of the Supreme Ordainer. 

 In the dedicatory note at the beginning of this Tablet Baha'u'llah affirms that this Epistle was written about the calamities of the Letters of Loftiness and that in those days He dedicated it to a particular person. Later certain individuals  begged Baha'u'llah to write a commentary on it in the Persian tongue. It was done and this Tablet became manifest and resplendent in gemlike words. He explains also that since word-for-word translation, in conformity with the original style, lacks refinement, that which streamed forth from His Pen was recorded. 

 The person alluded to in the text is Baha'u'llah's cousin, Mirza Mubammad Vazir, who was much loved and favoured by Him. 

 He passed away in M~zindar~n, Persia, at the time when Baha'u'llah was in BaghdAd. 

 Ills death came as a tragic blow both to Baha'u'llah and the rest of the Hoiy Family, particularly to the wife and sister of the deceased named 

LIavvA (Eve) and Maryam   
(Mary) respectively.      

 Therefore  as a token of heartfelt sympathy for the loss His tw6 loved kinswomen had sustained, Baha'u'llah honoured them with this Tablet which immortalized their memory and brought solace and consolation to their grief-laden hearts. In the closing paragraph of this Tablet Baha'u'llah recalls to mind, in touching language,  the burdens of care and anguish these two souls were destined to bear. The epilogue opens with these words: "However, Thou I-ian ordained that afflictions shall, in these times, be the lot of these two beauteous countenances. The first is named after the One whom Thou liast singled out to be the Mother of all mankind, and the other is the one who beareth the name of Her whom Thou hast raised above all the women in the world." 

  Maryam, the sister of the deceased Mirza Mubainmad 

Vazir, was Baha'u'llah's   
cousin who had married    

His half-brother, Mirza   

 RfiJA Qull. She was greatly devoted to IBahA'u'Ihh, enjoyed His unqualified confidence and was highly admired by Him for her noble qualities and spiritual attainments. Notable among Maryam's writings is a poem she wrote in praise of Baha'u'llah in which she gives vent to the gnawing grief she bore for her separation from 

Him.                      
     Among the Tablets Baha'u'llah

 revealed in her name is the wellknown Tablet of Maryam from which Shoghi Effendi quotes a few passages  in God Passes By. One passage is as follows: "The wrongs I suffer have blotted out the wrongs suffered by My First Name (the BeTh) from the Tablet of creation." 

 "0 Maryam!" He continues, "From the Land of Td (Tilirdn), after countless afflictions, We reached 'Irdq, at the bidding of the Tyrant of Persia, where after the fetters of Our foes, We were afflicted with the perfidy of Our friends. God knoweth what befell Me thereafter." 

  And another passage: "I roamed the wilderness of resignation, travelling in such wise that in My exile every eye wept sore over Me, and all created things shed tears of blood because of My anguish. The birds of the air were My companions and the beasts of the field My associates." 

  Maryam passed away in TihrAn and is buried in the precincts of N~siri'd-Din ShTh's sepulchre  in the outskirts of the capital.

     JAVAHIRU'L-ASRAR           
(The Essence of Mysteries) 

  Javdhiru'l-Asrdr is a monumental work. It is one of the choicest fruits that the Revelation of Baha'u'llah has yielded. Judged by the nature of its contents, this illuminating book, which is written in eloquent Arabic, may be regarded as a sister to the Iqan, since most of the subjects treated in that celebrated work are also briefly mentioned in this epistle. it was written by Baha'u'llah in BaghdAd sometime before the revelation of the Iqan, in answer to a number of questions put to Him by 1kM Siyyid Mu¼m-mad-i-IsfAh~ni,  one of the most accomplished Persian students of 15f&hAn who at that time resided in 'frdq. 

 In this mighty epistle, within the space of about one hundred pages, Baha'u'llah refers to the grievous tribulation and adversities that He suffered at the hand of the infidels; deplores the perversity of the followers of past religions; elucidates the meaning of the signs and prophecies  concerning the advent of the new Manifestation,  including the mea.ning of the passage in the Bible where it says: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My word shall not pass away"; affirms the continuity of divine revelation; unfolds  the significance of such symbolic terms as "the Day of Judgment", "the Balance", "the Way", "the resurrection of the dead", and "the identity of the Promised QA'im and the place from which He is expected to appear"; asserts the inevitability of heaven-sent trials, and describes the inner meaning of such terms as "life and death", "attainment to the presence of God", "the valley of bewilderment", "the station of self-surrender" and "the character and qualities of those who have attained His Court". 

  IjAji Siyyid Mubammad      

 was one of the distinguished disciples of the learned and wellknown  Shaykh Murti4la Ansciri who was the recognized head of the Shi'ah hierarchy and occupied a preeminent position among the leaders of Is1~m. (This is the same Ans~ri to whom Baha'u'llah refers in His Epistle to the ShAh of Persia). 

 On completing his studies at the Muslim centre of learning at SAmarrA' in 'IrAq, Siyyid Mubammad was elevated to the rank of Mujtahid, a title which confers upon the holder the authority to expound and apply the laws and doctrines of Is1~m. Having thus attained the pinnacle of the learning of his time, he decided to return to his home town of IsfAhAn to practise law and act as the leading cleric of that city. He therefore left for Baghda~d where he stayed for a time at the home of two Persian merchant brothers from his home town of Isf&h~n. 

 During his sojourn there he learned that the B&bi movement had made great headway in that city under the leadership of one who bore the title of Baha'u'llah. Siyyid Mubammad, boastful of his high learning and priding himself  on his new title and position, felt inclined to seek a confrontation with the leader of this new movement, with the view to confound him by his power of argument and superior knowledge, and to assert his ascendancy over him. Such a victory, he thought, would enhance his position in the eyes of the leading muI1~s and redound to his glory and reputation throughout Persia and 'Jr~q. 

 Therefore, one evening he sought a meeting with Baha'u'llah at Ills home and was admitted into His presence. This meeting must have been dramatic and stirring beyond words. 

 It lasted several hours at the end of which time Siyyid Muliammad, far from having gained ascendancy over his adversary found, to his amazement,  that he had virtually been reduced to a speck of dust in the face of the overwhelming power and knowledge of his Host. 

 Presently his sense of pride and vanity evaporated and gave way to humility and submissiveness. There at this meeting he became convinced of the divine character of the new Revelation and was so impressed by the transcendent personality of Baha'u'llah that he sat in His presence for a long time, spellbound with wonder and awe. Eventually when the time for leavetaking came, it was well past midnight. 

 On reaching his lodging that night he boldly told his landlords where he had been and what had transpired at the meeting. 
Being extremely

 fanatical in religious matters, the two I~fAhdni brothers rebuked him severely, denied him food and drink, and in a rush of anger expelled him from their house in the dead of night. Undismayed  by this ungracious treatment, Siyyid Mubainmad trudged his way on foot to SAmarrA', a distance of about one hundred kilometers, where he sought the presence of his former master and spiritual leader, the far-famed  Shayijfi Murti~1a Ap~Arf at the same school which he himself had attended as a pupil. When he entered his presence, he found him giving a discourse to a vast company of his disciples. He sat there among the audience and, immediately after the talk was over, sprang to his feet and in a courageous and impressive manner expounded the teachings of the Bab and vindicated the truth of His mission. 

 Thereupon  a wave of indignation swept over the whole company who denounced him as a heretic and rushed upon him in fury, and had it not been for the tactful and timely intervention of their master they would have inflicted severe injuries upon him. 

 The words of Siyyid Mubammad, however, made a deep impression upon his learned master, who deplored the unseemly conduct of his students. 

 Meanwhile he thought the moment was not propitious to comment on this subject, but promised to examine the teachings of this new creed and make a statement about it later. 

 As to Siyyid Muhammad, he remained firm and steadfast in the new Faith he had embraced, despite the bitter hatred and opposition of the Muslim clergy, and soon after this incident took up his residence in Najaf, renounced title and position and devoted much of his time to studying and spreading the teachings of this Revelation. Then sometime later he was prompted to write to Baha'u'llah and ask for elucidation of certain questions which baffled his mind. 

In reply, Baha'u'llah     

 revealed this sparkling gem, the Javdlziru'l-Asrdr, for his enlightenment and that of men of understanding in this age. 
                          
  LAWIJ-I-SHIKKAR SHIKAN    

 This Tablet was revealed by Baha'u'llah sometime towards the end of His sojourn in BaghdAd in reply to a seemingly mild communication addressed to Him by Mirza Said Khdn the then Persian 

Foreign Minister. In God  
Passes By Shoghi Effendi  

 describes the evil machinations of this crafty man who stigmatized the Faith as a "misguided and detestable sect" and assiduously endeavoured, through the dissemination of false reports and alarming accusations, to have Baha'u'llah banished to a place far removed from the Persian border. In his letter the minister feigned concern about Baha'u'llah's safety, saying that he had reasons to believe that His enemies were conspiring against Him, and that it would be advisable for him to transfer His place of residence  to another town away from Bagfid~d. Baha'u'llah's reply, embodied in this Tablet, is imbued with the spirit of detachment and fortitude  and strikingly reflects His imperturbable calm and serenity. One passage runs as follows: "One should kiss the hand of the executioner and, rapt in holy ecstasy, set one's face towards the abode of the Beloved." 

  And further He says: "Holding up Our neck, We eagerly yearn for the pitiless sword of the Loved One, and, exposing Our breast, We crave, with heart and soul, after the darts of His Decree. 

 We disdain fame and keep alooffrom aught else but Him. We neither flee from Our enemies nor disperse them. We earnestly pray for adversity in order to soar in the holy realms of the spirit, abide 'neath the shade of the tree of reunion and attain the loftiest station of love. Afflictions cannot annihilate this people. 

 This wayfaring cannot be accomplished by human fret, nor can any veil obscure this Countenance. 

  And further He continues: "We are established upon the seat of tranquillity and occupy the couch of resignation. Why should the mysticfishfear shipwreck, or the sanctified spirit allow itself to be distressed at the destruction of the physical body?" 
                          
 LAWIJ-I-GHULAMU'L KHULD

Paradise)                 
                          
    This wonderful Tablet     
was revealed by           

Baha'u'llah in BaglidAd    

 during the Ridvan Festival. The first part is in Arabic, the latter in Persian. It begins with these words: "This is in commemoration of what bath been manifested in the year sixty, in the Days of God,


<p631>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS          631

  the Omnipotent, the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the 

All-Knowing."              

  Every word of this Tablet rings with ecstasy and heavenly delight and reverberates with the glorification of the dawning light of the Day of God which broke on the horizon of ShirAz through the appearance of the DAb. 

 Here Baha'u'llah extols this momentous event by means of symbolic expressions which are interspersed with many a soul-stirring refrain such as this one: "Glad-tidings! This is the Youth of Paradise. Verily He is come with the crystal water." 

 In the latter part of this Tablet Baha'u'llah refers to the coming of Him Who is the Desired One, and proclaims: "0 friends! The Wine of eternal life is streaming forth. 0 ye that yearn after Him! The Beauty of the Beloved is unveiled and manifest. 0 beloved ones! The Flame on the Sinai of love is shining resplendent." 
                           
     LA WIT-I-HA WDAJ           

 (Tablet of the Ifowdah) This Tablet which is also known as the Tablet of Sdmsan is yet another wondrous outpouring of the Pen of Baha'u'llah. 

 It was revealed in August 1863 when He, together with the company  of the exiles, had reached the outskirts of S&msan on the Black Sea, on their way to Constantinople. 

    In God Passes By Shoghi    

 Effendi refers to this Tablet in these words: "Sighting from His howdah the Black Sea, as He approached the port of SAmsiin, RaM-'u'lhh,  at the request of Mirza Aq~ JAn, revealed a Tablet, designated 

Law4-i-Ilawdaj (Tablet     

 of the Tlowdah), which by such allusions  as the 'Divine Touchstone', 'the grievous and tormenting mischief', reaffirmed and supplemented  the dire predictions recorded in the recently revealed Tablet of the Holy Mariner." 

 The opening passage of the Tablet runs as follows: "These verses were revealed behind the Veil of Immortality, in the Howdak of Holiness, when the Most Great Name arrived from the court of the All-Glorious in the land of Sdins4n, on the shore of the great sea. Thereupon the hosts of divine revelation descended; arrayed in such beauty that all that are in heaven and on earth were dumbfounded. The Day Star of Beauty shone forth before them in His holy and ethereal Temple and addressed to the Ark what had previously been revealed in a Tablet by the Pen of the Most High, in which the Holy Mariner is invoked in a tone of grief" The theme which runs through the text of this historic Tablet is the aflirnmtion of the invincible power of the Cause of God, stressing that whatever the reverses and setbacks the Cause may yet suffer, there can be no shadow of doubt that its future glory and triumph are unimaginably great. 
                           
TABLET TO SULTAN 'ABDU'L-'AZIZ
    AND HIS MINISTERS          

 Unfortunately the text of this momentous Tablet is not available. However, in GodPasses By Shoghi Effendi describes the historical background as well as the dire circumstances which led to the revelation of this mighty Tablet. 

 The following extracts are highly illuminating: "The initial phase of that Proclamation may be said to have opened in Constantinople with the communication (the text of which we, alas, do not possess) addressed by Baha'u'llah to Su1t~n 'Abdu'1-'Aziz himself, the self-styled vicar of the Prophet of IslAm and the absolute ruler of a mighty empire. The occasion for this communication was provided by the infamous edict the SultAn had promulgated, less than four months after the arrival of the exiles in his capital, banishing them, suddenly and without any justification whatsoever, in the depth of winter, and in the most humiliating circumstances, to Adrianople, situated on the extremities of his empire. No less a personage than the highly-respected brother-in-law of the Sadr-i-A'zarn was commissioned to apprize the Captive of the edict pronounced against Him. 
. .                        

 "That same day a Tablet, severely condemnatory in tone, was revealed by Baha'u'llah, was entrusted by Him, in a sealed envelope, on the following morning to Shamsi Big, who was instructed to deliver it into the hands of 'Air P6sh~ and to say that it was sent down from God. "I know not what that letter contained," Shamsi Big subsequently informed AqAy-i-Kalim,  "for no sooner had the Grand Vizir perused it than he turned the color of a corpse, and remarked: 'It is as if the King of Kings

 were issuing his behest to his humblest vassal king and regulating his conduct.' 

 So grievous was his condition that I backed out of his presence." "Whatever aclion," Baha'u'llah, commenting on the effect that Tablet had produced,  is reported to have stated, "the ministers of the Suitdn took against Us, after having become acquainted with its contents, cannot be regarded as unjustifiable. 

 The acts they committed before its perusal, however, can have no justification." 

 "That Tablet, according to Nabil, was of considerable length, opened with words directed  to the sovereign himself, severely censured his ministers, exposed their immaturity and incompetence, and included passages in which the ministers themselves were addressed, in which they were boldly challenged, and sternly admonished not to pride themselves on their worldly possessions, nor foolishly seek the riches of which time would inexorably rob them. 
                           
      LAWIJ-T-NAQUS              

 (The Tablet of the Bell) "0 Monk of the Incomparable One! Ring out the Bell, inasmuch as the Day of the Lord hath shone forth and the Beauty of the All-Glorious is established upon His holy and resplendent Throne." 

  This Tablet, the opening verse of which is given above, reflects in every word the grandeur and sublimity of this divine Revelation. Whether this is due to its rare eloquence or the captivating charm of its refrains, or the depth and wealth of its symbolic terms, or the beauty of its rhymed words and phrases, or the sense of heavenly joy its glad-tidings evoke, or is due to any combination of these features, it is hard to say. Baha'u'llah revealed these verses of praise in celebration of that auspicious night which witnessed the inception of the Faith of God on earth through the declaration of the BTh. 

 Shoghi Effendi in a letter to Mr. Ag~h of Shir~z affirms that this Tablet was revealed by Baha'u'llah and written in His own hand in Constantinople on the eve of the fifth of Jam~idiyu'1-Avva1, 1280 AM. (October 19, 1863) which marks the twenty-first lunar anniversary of the Bab's declaration, at the request of one of His devoted companions named Mubammad 'Mi IsfTh~nf. 

 (An outline of his biography appears in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Memorials of the FaithfuL) Shoghi Effendi considers that it would be appropriate to read this Tablet at the meetings held for the celebration of this anniversary. 
                           
         MATHNAVI                   

 This is a collection of veritable mystic gems which the Pen of Baha'u'llah has strung together  into a masterpiece of poetry. 

 The work comprises more than three hundred lines of enchanting verse in Persian, and is yet another striking evidence of Baha'u'llah's matchless utterance. 

 In these verses Baha'u'llah communes with His own inner Being in the language of a lover whose heart leaps with joy and adoration, or like a nightingale which pours forth songs of praise in its ardent longing for the beauty of the mystic Rose. He invokes the Source of 

His Soul, beseeching It    

 to reveal a glimpse of Its eternal beauty and to bestow upon the world a dewdrop  from the infinite ocean of divine mercy, so that wayward humanity may be redeemed and attain to a new life. 

 The verses abound in allegorical terms, and their reading evokes a subtle and deep thought in one's mind. 

 It opens up a new approach to the knowledge of God and unfolds a vast horizon for contemplation of the greatness of Baha'u'llah's manifestation. 

 The work was revealed in Constantinople in 1863, as Baha'u'llah Himself affirms in His monumental apologia, the Kitdb-i-Badi',where-in He voices His yearning for tribulation in the path of His Beloved. There He quotes the closing lines of this work which refer to the same theme and give vent also to His anguish at the fate 

His Most Holy Habitation   

 in Bag~d~d was destined to suffer. These few lines run somewhat like this: "From the Court of the Beloved, 0 gentle breeze! 

 Wing for once thy way over the land of Bag] 
jdci 4.                    
Say unto her: 0 City of    

God!                       

 How canst thou remain tranquil since thy Beloved is gone away? 

 Thy Beloved is consigned to prison and sorely wronged, Like unto Ifusayn on the plain of Karbild. 

 One lonely Ijusayn amid thousands of Yazids, One single Friend among a host of fierce foes."

               4. THE TONGUE OF POWER

                   B~ EUNICE BRAUN

  OF all the works of man, words are the most enduring. 

 The temple of Solomon has crumbled to dust, the melodies that David played to accompany the psalms have drifted away on an ancient wind, but the words live: "Day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledge." The 

Ten Commandments of Moses  

 and the parables of Jesus still guide men's lives though no material tokens remain to mark the passing of Their days on earth. 

 For words are carried forward not only on clay and stone, on papyrus and parchment, but in the mind and heart and on the tongue; and the words of the Prophet of God are like no other words for they are inscribed upon the inner recesses of the soul. 

 "Write all that We have revealed unto thee with the ink of light upon the tablet of thy spirit,"' Baha'u'llah commands. 

 This is the ink that survives millenniums of time and comes forth renewed in each dispensation  when the Divine Author appears again. In this King of Days, the dispensation of Baha'u'llah, He gives us the Hidden Words, a volume slim and sparing of words as a small book of poetry, but so potent that it reveals to us the essence of all that has been "uttered by the tongue ofpower and might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old."2 History does not trace the exact pathway that began with man's first uttered words as symbols of communication until the day that language became letters to be engraved on tablets of stone, so that man could record the laws of his Lord for the generations that followed. The pictograplis and hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt are the earliest known written symbols; and it seems highly significant to the unfolding drama of Revelation through the ages that the phonetic alphabet is attributed to a Semitic People and had its origin in the Sinaitic peninsula. 

 Undoubtedly it was a Manifestation of God who brought the impetus that made man's tongue an instrument of power and inspiration. "The God of Mercy Izath taught the Qur'an, bath created man, and taught him articulate speecIz."~ The pathway of civilization is marked by words — from first, simple sounds spoken to convey man's needs and desires, to a religious literature revealed for planetary man in an age of universal  peace. 

 Literature is defined as the "writings of a period or country kept alive by beauty of style or thought", but the revealed Word of God cannot be contained within this definition. Although it has its origin in the land of the Prophet and is revealed in the tongue that He speaks, it has a power which transcends limitations  of language, culture and physical boundaries.  Men may reach forth to quench it but it is carried like an underground stream beyond the borders of its beginning. 

 It belongs to no one people or culture but to all the souls who desire it. Drop by drop, through hidden springs, or thundering over cataracts, it brings its soul-refreshing  water of life. 

 Thus the parables of Jesus, spoken in an almost forgotten Aramaic tongue in ancient Palestine, were retold throughout the Greek and Latin world and were later to become Holy Scripture to all 

Europe, the New World      

 and beyond. The holy books of the Jews were included, making words recorded on clay tablets on Mount Sinai a code of ethics for the western world. 

 The scholar who selects, c9mpares and evaluates, must use a different measuring rod when confronted with the Revealed Word of God. He must look through the same glass as the artist, craftsman, lawyer or labourer — the glass of a pure heart, whereby all who know truth are aided to see with their "own eyes and not through the eyes of otIzers."~ The greatest of all divine gifts to man, apart from the gift of life and consciousness itself, is the Creative Word of God. Through it, God manifests His mercy and His justice. 

 The Word spoken by His chosen Manifestation changes individual lives and redirects the currents of civilization. This is the Word, which the Bible declares is not "returned void". It accomplishes its mission, for it is creative. 

 The fabric of personal faith is knitted to that Word when the golden thread of man's inner faculty,


<p634>
634                 THE HAHX'i WORLD

 his spiritual insight, responds to the Word of the Prophet of God and reaches out to be woven with the greater pattern of the Divine Will. 

 "Be" declares the Prophet of God, and it is. It may not be visible to our eyes today, but tomorrow or next year or next century all is fulfilled. 

 Stories of the coming of Revelation from God are ifiled with mystery and awe for us. To Moses the Voice spoke from a burning bush that flames would not consume. A Voice from the heavens spoke to Jesus when He came out of the River 

Jordan; and Mubammad's     

 first awareness of His role as God's Revelator came to Him on Mount Hira, near Mecca, when the Voice spoke: "Cry in the Name of Thy Lord!" In this new Dispensation, when the whole world of humanity shall look to one Author, we have been brought nearer to this divine phenomenon, for we live in the Day of Days when the Word itself has been signed and sealed and sometimes even penned by the Prophet's own hand. 

 What were the circumstances surrounding Baha'u'llah when the first intimation of Revelation  came to Him Who was to be the Creator of a new world order, the Lord of Hosts, the Spirit of Truth? Shoghi Effendi, great grandson of 

Baha'u'llah, Guardian      

 of the Baha'i Faith, has shed light upon this auspicious event in his historical work, God Passes By. 

 To Baha'u'llah, descendant of Abraham, Zoroaster and Jesse, and scion of a noble Persian family, Revelation did not come at first on a mountain top nor on the banks of a river. It came in a subterranean dungeon in the prison of SiyTh-CI2M in Tibr~n, where He had been placed as an expounder of the Cause oftheBAb, the youthful Prophet who had been martyred three years earlier. In chains Baha'u'llah first heard the Voice that said: "Verily, We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy Pen."5 The short, meteoric mission of the flAb, Herald and Forerunner of Baha'u'llah, was evolving "in the year nine"~ (as He had proclaimed in His book, the Persian Baydn), into the Mission of "Him Whom God would make manifest".~ The Baydn was the seed, the Bab wrote from the prison fortress of MTh-Kit that held within it the potentialities of the "Revela-tion  that was to come." It was revealed "Iirw no other purpose except to establish the truth of 

His Baha'u'llah's Cause." 
   Although the Persian Baydn 

 contained laws and ordinances that were to abrogate the Quranic laws and inaugurate a new, universal cycle, Shoghi Effendi states that these were not designed to be a permanent guide for the future, but rather a eulogy of the Promised One. In referring to these ordinances, Baha'u'llah later wrote: the world of Command bath been made dependent upon Our acceptance." 

 He had, therefore, "enforced some of them and revealed them in a different text, in the Book of Aqdas, while We have not adopted others."8 Much of the B6t's voluminous Writings were despoiled andinterpolated by His enemies. Of all His works, Baha'u'llah states in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn, "the first, the greatest and might-jest  of all" was the Qayyamu'l-Asmd', the commentary on the 

Sikili of Joseph. The      

 first chapter had been revealed to MuIIA Ijusayn in the upper room of the BTh's home on that memorable eve of May 23, 1844. 

 A portion was later presented to Baha'u'llah, winning His immediate allegiance to the BTh's Cause. Its main purpose was to prepare the people for the coming of the "true Joseph" (Baha'u'llah) and to foretell the tribulations that He would suffer at the hand of His own brother. 

 Revealed in Arabic, this entire work was translated into Persian by the renowned poetess, TAhirili, the only woman among the BTh's early disciples. Portions of this work and others of the BTh are quoted in many passages in the major Baha works. 

 The Voice that spoke to Baha'u'llah in the fetid dungeon of the Siyah-Ch6l marked the beginning of Revelation. It continued with His banishment to Baha'u'llah where He revealed the Tablet of Kullu't-Ta'dm, proving His ascendancy over the superficiality of His half-brother Mirza Ya~y6, who was already fulifihing the divisive role foretold by the Bab. The Voice accompanied Baha'u'llah to the mountains of Kurdist~n, in Su1aym~niyyih, where He retreated  for a time in the attire of a dervish. Here He astounded scholars, learned doctors and people of all degree when they discovered His presence. 

 The beauty and power of an Arabic ode, the Qa~idiy-i-Varqd'iyyilz, so moved them that they declared it surpassed the work of their most illustrious poet, Ibn-i-FAriQ, though they were unaware of Baha'u'llah's true station.

 These days of self-exile were to be His last days of comparative tranquillity. 

 Soon He would return to BaghdAd, knowing full well the role He must play. 

 A soul-stirring picture comes to mind when we think of Him now, pacing the banks of the River Tigris, revealing the Hidden Words, a portion each in Persian and Arabic. 
It was the year 1858.      

 He was forty-one years of age, approaching the springtide of His spiritual magnitude. 

 The Kitdb-i-Iqdn was revealed during this second Baglid&1 period and Shoghi Effendi declares these two works to be "two outstanding contributions to the world's religious literature." 

 The Kitdb-i-Iqdn, he further states, is "foremost among the priceless ~     of His Revelation, occupying an unequalled station in Baha literature (except for the KiM b-i-A qdas, the 

Book of Laws).             

 The Seven Valleys and The Four Valleys were written during this period, together with a flood of epistles, odes, tablets, commentaries and prayers. These were portents of what was to come, as He gathered together the reins of His Prophethood in the seven-year period that marked His return from Su1aym~niyyih, until the declaration of His Mission in the garden of RhJv6n, in April, 1863. 

 In the Tablet of the Holy Mariner, written on the fifth day of Nawruz, 1863, before His banishment to Constantinople, He foretold the grim trials that lay ahead, a theme shortly reaffirmed  in the Lawh-i-Hawdaj revealed as the band of exiles neared the port of SAmsfin where Baha'u'llah caught a first sunset glimpse of the Black Sea and a Turkish steamer that awaited Him. 

 Now began a new phase of Baha'u'llah's ministry, to be reflected in His Writings. During the four months in Constantinople, the Proclamations  to the kings and ecclesiastical leaders began. First came a Tablet to the proud, arrogant 

Sulpin of Turkey, 'Abdu'1-'Aziz;

 then a Tablet to 'Au PAsM Grand Vizier, who stated that it was as if "the King of Kings were issuing his behest to his humblest vassal. 

 Through the subsequent five years in Adria-nople, the calamities foreshadowed in the earlier Tablets developed relentlessly. 

 Here Baha'u'llah suffered some of the most anguished moments of His entire life. Here He proclaimed His Mission, powerfully and inexorably  to the world's leaders. The prayers of fasting were revealed. 

 The Tablets to Napoleon HI, the ShAh of Persia, the rulers of Christendom were written and the Tablet to the Kings (the 

Sdriy-i-Muldk). These      

 were the letters of a divine Prisoner to those who seemingly held His life in their hands, who had the power not only to assuage His suffering but to summon the people and nations of the world to a just and lasting peace. 

 Shoghi Fifendi's condensed but weighty work, The Promised Day is Come, addressed to DahA'is of the West, summarizes many of these illustrious Tablets and analyses the impact they were destined to have upon their recipients and upon the whole world. 

 Hardly had they been written, when religious and political dynasties began to reveal their internal weaknesses. 
The "sword of wisdom..     

 hotter than summer heat, and sharper than blades of steel"1' had struck. 

 Shortly before leaving for His last exile to 'Akka in Palestine in 1868, IBaM'u'lldh revealed the 

Tablet to Ra'is. From      

 this moment, He declared, the equilibrium of the world and its people had been upset, a process that would continue until the Teachings of the true Physician would be applied. 

 In The World Order of Baha'u'llah, a series of letters written by Shoghi Effendi immediately preceding World War H, we are apprised of this retributive and purifying process that involves  the disintegration of the old order along with the emergence of a new, divinely inspired civilization. 

 Herein are outlined the steps that will take humanity from the nucleus of that new order as it exists today, to its fruition in a universal, golden age when the whole earth "will have yielded its noblest fruits," The product of Baha'u'llah's pen reached its zenith during His incarceration in 'Akka from August 31, 1868, until His passing on May 29, 1892. Additional Tablets were written to the kings, to Pope Pius IX, and to Queen Victoria, whom He commends for having "entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people." 

    The Kitab-i-Aqdas, His     

 Book of Laws, revealed while residing in the House of 'Abbad, was the "most signal act" of 

Ills ministry, Shoghi      

 Fifendi states. The resounding theme of all these Tablets and of the Aqdas itself is justice for all mankind. 

 Although not yet adequately translated into English or available in its entirety, large portions of this

636                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Book are found in the major Baha'i works such as Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah and the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf and are quoted by Shoghi Effendi in his works, God Passes By, The World Order of 

Baha'u'llah, The Promised 
Day is Come and The Advent 

 of Divine Justice.* Its spirit is also to be found in the gradual training of the believers by 'Abdu'l-Baha in a whole new arena of spiritual understanding and social responsibility. 

 The Aqdas was supplemented by Baha'u'llah with additional ordinances in such Tablets as I~~rdqdt, Tajalliydt, 

Tardzuit Bishdrdt, Tablet  

 of the World, and others, contained complete or in part, in chapter four of Baha'i World Faith. 

 Baha'u'llah's last major work was the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf It was written to a bitter enemy, a person filled with hatred for Baha'u'llah and for the Light which He brought. Its soul-lifting theme is the overflowing mercy of God, a divine gift to which even a darkened soul can reach out and grasp, if it will. In this work Baha'u'llah alludes to Ills Book of the Covenant, the Kitab-i-Aqdas, as the "Crimson Book", 

His "Most Great Tablet".   

 This was written entirely in His own hand and given to 'Abdu'l-Baha for safekeeping shortly before His passing. 

 In this document, the link that was to maintain the unity and authority of the Faith was forged when 'Abdu'l-Baha, His eldest Son, was appointed the Centre of His Faith, the "delineator of its future institutions." 

 These are highlights only of the voluminous Writings of Baha'u'llah, the outpouring of thirty-nine years of continuous Revelation. "Well is it with him who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Baha'u'llah  , the Bab had declared in the 

Baydn. Now Baha'u'llah      

 could say as His earthly life neared its close: "We have not fallen short of Our duty to exhort men and to deliver that whereunto I was bidden by God. 

 One of the first Tablets revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 during the first year of His ministry, was to reecho the call of the Rib to the Western nations and peoples, singling out especially the American continent which was to "lead all nations spiritually", a call which culminated later in the revelation of The Tablets of the Divine Plan revealed during 

World War I. Sent to America

 shortly after the war, these letters brought to that community its first understand* 

* "A Synopsis and Codification

 of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas" was published by the 

Universal House of Justice 
in 1973.                   

 ing of the leading role it was to play in bringing the 

Teachings of Baha'u'llah   

 to the entire world. Shoghi Effendi called it the 

Divine Charter of Teaching.

 Upon it were based two Seven-Year Plans for the American Baha'is, the great Ten-Year World Crusade undertaken by the entire world Baha community and launched by the Guardian in 1953, the current Nine Year Plan of the Universal House of Justice and upon it will be based other teaching plans in the future. 

     'Abdu'l-Baha's Writings    

 form a unique part of the literature of the Baha Faith. Although not the Creative Word of the Manifestation of God, they nonetheless possess authority, both because He was the appointed 

Interpreter and Exemplar   

 of the Teachings and because of the inherent spiritual stature of this Vehicle to Whom the authority had been given. 

     'Abdu'l-Baha's Writings    

 had reached the West as early as 1891 when A Traveller's Narrative, translated by Professor E. G. Browne, the famous orientalist, was published by the Cambridge  University Press, its authorship unknown  at the time. 

In the East, The Secret    

 of Divine Civilization had also been anonymously published in India in 1875, followed by an English translation published in 1910 in London,  under the title 

The Mysterious Forces      
of Civilization.           

 Noteworthy during this period were the talks given as answers to the questions of a pilgrim to the Holy Land in the years 1904 —  1906, the most troublous period of 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry. These answers were given to Laura Clifford Barney in Persian, translated into English and published with His approval as Some Answered Questions in 1908. During this time, 'Abdu'l-Baha was known to write with His own hand as many as ninety Tablets a day, often working through the nighttime hours to carry on His manifold responsibilities. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha's lectures and informal talks during His western journeys to proclaim the Faith of Baha'u'llah (1911 — 1913) were recorded in many compilations as Paris Talks (published in the 

United States as The       

 Wisdom of 'Abdu' 1-Bahd) and the comprehensive American collection, 

The Promulgation of Universal

 Peace (a selection of which is now available in Foundations  of World Unity). These lectures were given in churches, mosques, synagogues, universities,  the public platforms of philosophical

 and peace societies, in missions and in private homes. 

 They covered a broad range of subject matter — from the progressive character of religious revelation, the essential harmony of science and religion, the need for eliminating all forms of prejudice — to the steps necessary for establishing lasting peace and world order. Underlying all was the emphasis on the common origin and destiny of man and the organic unity that must be achieved in this century and which would evolve into a universal civilization,  characterized by higher moral and ethical standards than mankind has ever known. This, He said, would manifest itself through the power of the new Word released by Baha'u'llah. 

 As the BTh and Baha'u'llah had shared a unique spiritual communion that blended the Revelation of the Primal Point into that of the Promised One of all ages — so, in a lesser but equally efficacious way, The Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, according to Shoghi Effendi, was the result of the "mystic intercourse" between the Author of the IBahA'i Revelation and His appointed Interpreter. Through this Charter, the continuing unity and integrity of the Faith were assured through the institutions of the Guardianship, the Hands of the Cause of God and the Universal House of Justice ordained by Baha'u'llah. This document, unique in religious annals, appointed 

Shoghi Effendi Guardian    

 of the Faith. Under his patient but firm leadership, the institutions were further defined and reinforced and the administrative framework was outlined and caused to emerge throughout the world. His instructive letters guiding this development are found in Bahd'iAdministration and in Messages to the 

Baha'i World, 1950 — 1957    

 that marked the beginning of his communications to the Baha'i world community as a whole, rather than to National Assemblies and communities only. 

 These works and those mentioned previously (The World Order of Baha'u'llah, The Promised Day is Come and The Advent of Divine Just ice) are all analyses and commentaries on the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 They pertain either to the direct application of its administrative principles and the delineation of its goals, or they penetrate deeply into the significance of His Revelation to modern society, to the political, social and religious crisis of our time as well as to the future structure of world order. His monu mental, historical work, God Passes By, records the birth and rise of the Faith during its first century. 

 A commentary on Shoghi Effendi's contribution to Baha'i literature is not complete without mention of The Baha'i World volumes which received his deep interest and careful direction. These volumes, initiated by Horace Holley, which began in 1925, were, he stated, "unex-celled  and unapproached by any publication of its kind" in the varied literature of the Faith. They are an international record of the aims and purposes of the Faith and a documentation of its worldwide activities. 

 Baha'i literature will be further enriched in the future. There are Tablets not yet adequately translated into English. There are letters from the Master and from Shoghi Effendi not yet available in published form. One thing is certain however — Shoghi Effendi did not cease in his labours until the Revelation of Baha'u'llah was abundantly and authentically rendered into the English language, from which it has since been translated into hundreds of languages and tribal tongues. In the midst of the overwhelming task of guiding a world community, and in addition to his own writings, he translated the Kitdb-i-!qcin, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf Hidden Words, Prayers and Meditations, Glean ings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, many prayers and Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Nabil-i-A'zam's Narrative of the early days of the Faith, to which he gave the 

English title The Dawn-Breakers

 (a work he advocates as an "unchallengeable textbook" for summer schools and an "inspiration in all literary and artistic pursuits"). 

 The writings of Shoghi Effendi complete the literary symphony of the Faith. 

 As an inspired conductor, he has taken the divine composition of the Composer, blended it with the coda of the Master, and interpreted and applied it with clarity and precision for the guidance of those who comprise its multifarious audience. 

 The Teachings of Baha'u'llah, increasingly understood and practiced by its adherents, will in the future bring about a new, golden age of literature as in all the arts of man. In this current Formative Age, when the "new humanity" has not yet come into being, this flowering cannot spring forth. This is the day of planting, rooting and nurturing the Creative Word of God in the hearts of men. Man's most creative act in this


<p638>
day is the revivifying of souls so that the whole world can one day bring forth its finest fruit, the Kingdom of God, a divinely-inspired civilization.

And all the Atoms cry aloud I bear Him witness now Who by the light of suns beyond the suns beyond the sun with shill pen revealed renewal of the covenant of timelessness with time, proclaimed advent of splendor joy alone can comprehend and the imperious evils of an age could not withstand and stars and stones and seas acclaimed — His life its crystal image and magnetic field. 

  I bear Him witness now —  mystery Whose major clues are the heart of man, the mystery of God: 

     Baha'u'llah:                

 Logos, poet, cosmic hero, surgeon, architect of our hope of peace, wronged, exiled One, chosen to endure what agonies of knowledge, what auroral dark bestowals of truth vision power anguish for our future's sake. "I was but a man "like others, asleep upon My couch, when, lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me..." 

  Called, as in dead of night a dreamer is roused to help the helpless flee a burning house. 

  I bear Him witness now: towards Him our history in its disastrous quest for meaning is impelled.

 You cannot see them so much as feel them Coming in crowds, never singly, coming Sudden, bursting color, thrusting blood-reds, Golds, pinks, on a landscape soon vibrant With the pristine singing of Spring, Laid upon a sea of dunes. 

  Watch them bloom quickly, coming Sudden to the hidden self, Spilling cocoons, gathering in groups, To share the blaze of freedom After the long year, The inward movement of the soil, The care of the single seed. 

  Now the moment deeply ancient, Now the meaning fully cosmic Explodes into being Revealing the kingdom of AbhA! Joan Imig Taylor

        The Return                

 Once   more in warm silence, let us understand each other, and into the stillness let a drum start beating. Let us sing once again with the wonderful lifting 

             Spirit                    

 of the days when the prairies had no fences, but were clean and beautiful for thousands of miles. 

  Let us ready ourselves for a great awakening, for it is now the day. This is the time when the Indian people will return to the Spirit. This is the age when we must teach the world to love; this is the day when our voices must be raised at the council tables of the world. 

  As our Wise ones foretold, we lost our Spirit. 

 The way was dark and confusion blinded us. The   path of another people led us far from the old way and from the wisdom we had known. 

  But this is the day of our return to the Spirit! Let us not fear, for there is a great new message from the East. 

 Let us search for this message and in it find our greatness and our joy. But let us beware lest we find a false message; let us study its meaning, let us make sure. 

  Let us turn to the inner light, dear people, and let us find warmth in its glow. Let us be swept up on the waves of glory to His nearness, to His knowledge. 

            Ron Gordon                

 Kllally,Saskatche wan We are searching Once on the prairies of blue, rose and yellow, my people sang their songs of glory to the Great One above. They hunted and chased and were all free together. Their hearts held the rose of love. 

  Now it hurts to see them. Day by day their hearts are broken they are the lonely, they are the sad, and misery is all they have. 

  But we have been told this sadness shall end, that there would come One from out of the East Who would ease our pain; He would come from the East and out over the West


<p641>
VERSE                    6              to plant the rose of love within the garden of our hearts. He would be a star of Beauty, a star of Light, the star of Truth. He would be as our Spirit and we would find our greatness in the light of the Beauty of the New Day, our happiness in this awakening Dawn. Yes, I believe that You are the return of the Spirit, O good and kind

 Around me changes the ever changing. For the changing is He Who is spoken of as the All Powerful, Who is the changeless. 

 And thus this great light never darkens but forever blazes over the ages in splendid beauty. Again in this age, in clothed beauty, does He return.

   The Perfect Silence       

 Here is the perfect silence Above the white and blue of ancient walls, The silver censer of the moon swings in mid-heaven. Faint fragrance of white jasmine is the spirit of all love Set free, — a still white flame within the crystal air. 

  Upon the seaward slope, the grove of giant pines Is etched in majesty against the moonlit night; Those tall black trunks are bars across the argent light, A high barred window set against the sky. 

  At sunset, when I knelt within the Shrine The windows to the west were walls of fire. 

 Within my soul the flame of His great Name Was like a flashing sword, that severed all my past. 

  From this eternal moment —  I knew myself before the Face of God, Too terrible His gkry and too great His power! 

 How shall one drop resist the ceaseless tide Of His celestial sea? 

  But now, when night is deep upon the land And the calm beauty of the moon Moves softly through the vast ethereal arch, Peace breathes through every atom of the air And draws each living spark to one pure unity. 

  The Timeless holds this instant in His hand: "lie still, be still, and know that Jam God!" 
Here is the perfect silence.

                      New Song

 (And he hath put a new song in my mouth. Psalms 40:3) It was comfortable in the smalitown smugness of your childhood. 

 You were born securely into salvation's complacent trinity, a Catholic, Protestant or Jew. In a spasm of spiritual megalomania you praised His good judgment in selecting such eminently deserving souls for the gift of His exclusive One True Faith. But only on Sundays. 
      The world was small and safe and familiar.
      And very white.
      No red or black offended our prim steepled vaults of self-congratulation.

 Indians were the bad guys who got licked in movies, dying copiously amid candy wrappers and the popcorn smell of matinees. 

 Amos and Andy probably lived in some far place, like Hollywood, or maybe in the radio. And there was no proof that God spoke Negro. 
      You knew that He loved Canadians; they didn't start wars.

 He would approve our thrift and industry and seeing our virtuous sunlit wheatfields, our unpretentious brick, He would agree with the Chamber of Commerce that ours was a good town in which to live. 
      Yes, it was comfortable then.

                 642                 THE BAHA'I WORLD

 Of course there were a handful who found solace in the medicinal doctrines of Muriel Sweetbun Udder, or the burnished tablets of Myron J. Hammerschmitt; a few who gathered in tents or behind vacant storefronts with ambitious titles attesting orthodoxy or reformation; but then every town has its malcontents. 

 A small brave band scorned our coniicbook catechism, our insolent litany of insularity, and made a kind of Faith of not-believing. 
Still, God did not strike them dead.

 He was said to be extraordinarily patient with sinners and heathens. 

 When you heard that God had died, you wondered whether it was from sheer boredom — all that joyless music and our impudent prayers. 

 Your sophomoric seifrighteousness would have been enough to do Him in. So you would have described it then, the frightened child striving to cope with acne and Auschwitz and an anger that sought release in a word powerful enough to shake the universe, intimidate the stars, blind to His love of the people of your town for the innocence of their aspiration; blind to their genuine virtue and power and beauty. 

  The tempest came in your twelfth or fifteenth year, a clean cold wind, and you were left like a stripped young tree in autumn with a cynical winter setting in and nothing large enough to house your impulse to believe. 

 The need lay as quiet, unhurried and insidious as a seed snowlocked in a bleak and lonely landscape. 

 But forgiveness came, an unselective flooding rain, and the seed was there, a promise kept. 

 Even your rejection was forgiven and in the burgeoning lovesap slowly stirred. 

 God hadn't died, of course, abandoned us for Russia, nor moved to Uganda. 

 You caught a glimpse of Him in the clearing smoke of the rifles in the barrack-square of Tabriz; heard a whisper in the soft silk dress of TAhirih, bridally white. 

 His fragrance was carried by the wind startling the wildflowers of the fields of BArfujtsh where Quddtts was felled. 
The stones of 'Akka saw His beauty and His pain and cried aloud.

 On Carmel's sandy slope you traced the outline of His tent and saw, in its tall cypress, the talisman of His triumph. 

  There is a new song. 

 Up from the SlyAb-ChAl it rose breaking the SMh's dreanr the Su1t~n turned in terror as its sweetness grew. 
It echoed through the palaces of Europe, empty now.

 The bells grew silent, the minarets fell mute; the full-risen sun embarrassed our disputatious sputtering candles. 

 Our doomed and desperate dissonance was stilled, trickling out like the dismal incense rising from our saddened, separate altars. 

 The dust of Shfrttz throbbed as Thornton Chase took up the song and all the roses of 16n spilled their musk triumphantly at Lua's peal. 
Martha heard the music; its accents captivated May.

 Westward it moved, and woridward, rejoicing the trees of Adrianople as the chorus grew — Esslemont, IBreakwell, Dreyfus — and grew and grew. 

 Now the earth is flooded with the felicity of this new song, this Godsong. 
Oh! Man must learn it well!
