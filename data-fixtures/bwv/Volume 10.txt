INTRODUCTION

  DURING the past twenty years the Baha'i community of East and West has learned to anticipate each successive volume of THE BAHA'I WORLD (the first number was entitled "Baha'i Year Book") as the best means by which the individual believer may keep abreast of the steady development of the Faith throughout the world. This work, in its illustrations as well as in its text, has recorded as completely as possible the progress of current Baha'i events and activities over an area now embracing more than seventy-eight t countries. In addition, each volume has presented those t!historical facts and fundamental l principles that constitute the distinguishing features of the Message of Baha'u'llah to this age." 

  The existence of so many evidences of a newly revealed Faith and Gospel for a humanity arrived at a turning point in its spiritual and social evolution has likewise a profound significance for the non-Eah~'i student and scholar who desires to investigate the world religion founded by the Mb and Baha'u'llah. For in these pages the reader encounters both the revealed Word in its spiritual powers, and the response which that utterance has evdked during the first one hundred years of the Baha'i era. He will find what is unparalleled in religious history — the unbroken continuity of a divine Faith from the Manifestation onward through four generations of human experience, and will be able to apprehend what impregnable foundations the Baha'i World Order rests upon in the life and teachings of the B~b and Baha'u'llah, the life and interpretation of 'Abdu'l-Baha, , and (since the year 1921) in the development of an administrative order under the direction of the Guardian of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi. 

  It is the avowed faith of Baha that this Revelation has established upon earth the spiritual impulse and the definite principles necessary for social regeneration and the attainment of one true religion and social order throughout the world. In THE BAHA'I WORLD, therefore, those who seek a higher will and wisdom than man possesses may learn how, amid the trials and tribulations of a decadent society, a new age has begun to emerge from the world of the spirit to the realm of human action and belief.

              AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE
                    BAHA'I FAITH
                  B~ HORACE HOLLEY

  MAY 23, 1944 signalized the ending of the first century of the Baha'i Era. That date marked an event of transcendent importance  in the evolution of religion and civilization. 

 From the dawn of the new era one hundred  years ago, religion, reborn and revitalized,  has been a spirit encompassing all mankind. It has penetrated into every department of human activity, creating influences  capable of destroying old, outworn ideas and their instruments and of disciplining  and training the masses of human beings for unified association in an ordered and peaceful world. The rise of science, the spread of invention, the revolution in industry,  the movement of peoples, the clash of nations and the implacable struggle of social philosophies, alike disclose the motivation of one spiritual impulse and energy which, laying hold on humanity, has been shaping its life in conformity with the possibilities of a new, a greater age. 

 Denied, even resisted by the prevalent attitude of materialism, this force of transmutation has, while the century closes, manifested  its irresistible power by gathering up the peoples of East and West and plunging them into the crucible of a common agony and trial. 

 Such an outcome can no longer be attributed to controllable human wills, acts and social trends. The groups and organizations,  great and small, which so long have maintained the principle of independence and self-sufficiency, even nations and empires, pires, find themselves confronted by menacing conditions both within and without. The universal upheaval is unprecedented. 

 Its implications can not be grasped except by recognition of this spirit from God and the working of His divine intention. Sovereignty has been transferred from nations to world and from races to mankind. The direction of events has been seized from human will and exercised through its own channels and instruments by the will of God. 

 Therefore the sects and creeds, reflecting the religious experience of an era that has departed, attached to and dependent on the principle of social isolation and self-suffi-ciency, have been deprived of divine guidance.  Hence too the political and economic policies representing the material activity of that same disavowed principle have become ineffective and impotent except in their capacity  to undermine the order on which they themselves depend. 

 Destiny has moved outside and beyond the ancient law of struggle and conflict to be the guardian of a new Dispensation of justice  and order. The Baha'i Faith, fulfilling the hope and vindicating the truth of former  Revelations, is the conscious expression of the new, world-unifying spirit in its source, its purpose and its power to regenerate  the life of mankind. 
                          
   THE SOURCE OF FAITH       

  The source of religion is sacred and inviolate. 

 Every Faith has come into this world from a higher realm. Every Revela 1

2               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  tion has conveyed light from the Sun of truth to the darkness of human hearts and minds. In each Dispensation the life of the soul has been rekindled, releasing capacity for moral conduct, ethical truth and social cooperation. 

 The life and teaching of the Founder of a religion is the essence and reality of that Dispensation, not the catalogue of dogmas and creeds which afterward registers  the progress of disputation among His followers and enthrones the arbitrary authority of a few official religionists over the people. 

 Baha'u'llah has given the world today a fuller measure of spiritual truth, befitting the mature development of humanity and the larger responsibility laid upon men called to establish a world civilization imbued with the spirit of divine law. 

 "The door of the knowledge of the Ancient Being," He declares, tthath ever been and will continue for ever to be, closed in the face of men. No man's understanding  shall ever gain access unto His holy court. As a token of His mercy, however, and as a proof of His lovingkindness, He hath manifested unto men the Day Stars of His divine guidance, the Symbols of His divine unity, and hath ordained the knowledge of these sanctified Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own Self. Whoso recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call, bath hearkened to the Voice of God, and whoso testi-fieth to the truth of their Revelation, hath testified to the truth of God Himself. Whoso turneth away from them, hath turned away from God, and whoso disbe-lieveth in them, hath disbelieved in God. Every one of them is the Way of God that connecteth this world with the realms above, and the Standard of His Truth unto every one in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. They are the 

Manifestations of God     

 amidst men, the evidences of His Truth, and the signs of His glory." 

 In these words the touchstone of religious truth and sincerity, the mainspring of faith, has been set up by which the attitude of the individual and the worth of the religious group are being tested in this age as they were divinely tested by the words of 

Jesus in His Dispensation 

 or by the commands of Moses in that Dispensation which Christ brought to an end. 

 The Founders of revealed religion, Abraham,  Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Bib and Baha'u'llah, "are all but one person, one soul, one spirit, one being, one revelation," and Baha'u'llah warns the people "lest ye be tempted to make any distinction between any of the Manifestations of His Cause, or to discriminate against the signs that have accompanied and proclaimed their Revelation  Whoso maketh the slightest possible  difference between their persons, their words, their messages, their acts and manners,  hath indeed disbelieved in God, hath repudiated His signs, and betrayed the 

Cause of His Messengers." 

 Thus we may realize today that the successive  Faiths have been different stages along the same path of revealed truth. Their relationship is that of one religion in con —  tinuity, each later Faith fulfilling all those that preceded it and preparing the way for the future Faith to appear in its destined time. 

 To conceive of many religions and different faiths existing simultaneously, their mutual tolerance sharing only their separateness  of inner purpose, is to identify men's repeated denials of God with obedience to God and their imitations of His merciful Revelations with divine truth itself. 

 It is when this identification has become complete, and the name of religion connotes some divisive sect, some militant creed or some impotent affirmation of already accepted  general ideals, that the Manifestation of God returns to earth with power to destroy error and establish teachings for a new cycle. 

 The oneness of revealed religion emerges also when we consider the connection between  each Faith and its corresponding civilization  and culture. 

 In its primitive purity, religion comes as a creative spirit inspiring human beings to establish a community for the expression of their union in devotion to newly revealed laws. 

 They feel that their faith opens for them a greater possibility of ordered life than man has ever before achieved. Out of this common experience a great civilization arises, runs its course of development, and decays with the lapse of the motivating sacrifice and loyalty. Once

  A scale model showing the future superstructure of the Bab's Shrine. The present building, constructed by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, on the very spot pointed out to Him by Baha'u'llah, is to be seen behind the arches of the future arcade. Ii will remain intact, receiving the embellishment of the dome which 'Abdu'l-Baha envisaged for it in its final state. 

  the process of dissolution has set in, the civilization can never regain its unity of purpose or restore the vital life of its faith. The disintegration of a civilization reveals a prevalent sickness of soul, for the cycle of religion coincides with the cycle of the civilization  it came to found. Until the spirit is renewed by the divine will, the world has no power to heal its own disease. 

 Attempts to reestablish the old order, or found a new society,  by revivals, adaptations and experiments, are vain. Effort to seize the new spirit and render it servant to the maintenance of old ideas, old standards, old forms and old authorities is fruitless. The continued existence of mankind depends upon the return of the Holy Spirit, and this dependence is the basis of true faith. 
                          
    THE DIVINE PURPOSE        

  The second illuminating truth conveyed by Baha'u'llah is that revealed religion is not only continuous but progressive. The race of man, under the manifest law of the universe, grows and develops. Humanity passes through stages of development and encounters greater opportunity and responsibility  as the stage of childhood recedes. 

 Human  capacity emerges and new faculties and talents unfold. This organic process, the divine purpose for mankind, moves forward by successive and enlarging spiritual im

  pulses. At each stage, the soul and mind of the race receives a new influx of inspiration,  human consciousness deepens, and when the direction and possibility of the new cycle has become established in the realm of faith, men express their enlarged capacity by forming a greater civilization. 

 "The All-Knowing Physician," in Baha'u'llah's  statement, "hath His finger on the puise of mankind. He perceiveth the disease,  and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom, the remedy. Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular aspiration.  The remedy the world needeth in its presentday afflictions can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements." 

 In his capacity of interpreter of Baha'u'llah's  Writings, 

Shoghi Effendi, first Guardian

 of the Baha'i Faith, has definitely traced the operation of this principle from stage to stage. 

 ttJust as the organic evolution of mankind  has been dow and gradual and involved successively the unification of the family, the tribe, the city-state, and the nation, so has the light vouchsafed by the Revelation of God, at various stages in the evolution of religion, and reflected in the successive Dispensations of the past, been dow and progressive. Indeed, the measure of Divine Revelation, in every age, has been adapted to, and commensurate wii~h, the degree of social progress achieved in that age by a constantly-evolving humanity. The Revelation associated with the Faith of Jesus Christ focussed attention primarily on the redemption of the individual and the molding  of his conduct, and stressed, as its central  theme, the necessity of inculcating a high standard of morality and discipline into man, as the fundamental unit in human  society. Nowhere in the Gospds do we find any reference to the unity of nations  or the unification of mankind as a whole. 

 The Faith of Islam, the succeeding  link in the chain of Divine Revelation, introduced, the conception of the nation  as a unit and a vital stage in the or — ganization of human society, and embodied it in its teaching." 

 With the creation of independent nations, replacing the tribal units of earlier faiths, the cycle of world order was Providentially prepared. 

 The divine purpose has manifested  itself anew, the law of the oneness of mankind has been revealed, and the spiritual impulse by which the race can achieve world unification has been communicated through the agency of a new World Faith. 

 "No sooner had He revealed Himself," Baha'u'llah wrote concerning the appearance of the Mb in 1844, t~than the foundations of the kindreds of the earth shook and trembled, and the learned swooned away, and the wise were bewildered, except such as have, through the power of Thy might, drawn nigh unto Thee. ." t(Through that Word," He wrote concerning His own appearance, ~~the realities of all created things were shaken, were divided, separated, scattered, combined and reunited, disclosing, in both the contingent world and the heavenly kingdom, entities of a new creation, and revealing, in the unseen realms, the signs and tokens of Thy unity and oneness.  Through that Call Thou didst an-flounce unto all Thy servants the advent of Thy most great Revelation and the appearance  of Thy most perfect Cause." 

 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant, who promulgated His Faith through the East and West, exemplified the perfect type of human character, intelligence and soul expressive of the laws and principles of this Wdrld Era. "Humanity has emerged," He said, ctfrom its former state of limitation and preliminary training. 

 Man must now become imbued with new virtues and powers, new moral standards,  new capacities. New bounties, perfect bestowals, are awaiting and already descending upon him. The gifts and blessings of the period of youth, although timely and sufficient  during the adolescence of mankind, are now incapable of meeting the require ments of its maturity.         All nations and kindreds     will become a single nation. 

 Religious and sectarian antagonism, the hostility of races and peoples, and differences among nations, will be eliminated. All men will adhere to one religion, will have

  one common faith, will be blended into one race, and will become a single people. All will dwell in one common fatherland, which is the planet itself." 

  LAWS, PRINCIPLES, TEACHINGS Religion is the depository of spiritual truth. Its laws and principles revealed by the Manifestations of God constitute the reality of man's relations to God, to himself and to other men. What science is to the natural universe religion is to mankind in all that pertains to its spiritual, its supernatural endowment and aim. There is no chaos nor void where truth ceases to exist nor laws to operate, but there is in man a realm of ignorance where he attempts to deny a divine law by substituting human desire and human opinion. The appearance of the new Manifestation brings all spiritual evasion and subterfuge to an end. He creates  a condition in which oniy truth can survive. 

        In the Baha'i Dispensation

 we find laws, principles and teachings, all reflecting the spirit of the new 

World Era. In this Dispensation 

 religion brings fulfilment to feeling,  will and reason in balance and harmony. 

 The western world first learned of the Faith through its principles. 'Abdu'l-Baha expounded them in the form of general truths acceptable to the enlightened mind whatever its class, creed, race or nation. In one of His public addresses in America He presented the following summary: —  "The oneness of the world of humanity. 

 CCThe protection and guidance of the Holy Spirit. 

 "The foundation of all religion is one. 

 "Religion must be the cause of unity. 

 (tReligion must accord with science and reason. 

 "Independent investigation of truth. 

 "Equality between men and women. 

 "The abandoning of all prejudices among mankind. 
     "Universal peace.         
     "U1 education.            
     teA universal language.   

  "Solution of the economic problem. 
     "An international tribunal."

 Of the source and meaning of these teachings  He said: "His Holiness Baha'u'llah has dawned from the horizon of the Orient, flooding all regions with light and life which will never pass away. His teachings embody the divine spirit of the age and are applicable to this period of maturity in the life of the human world. 

 "Every one who truly seeks and justly reflects will admit that the teachings of the present day emanating from mere human sources and authority are the cause of difficulty  and disagreement amongst mankind, the very destroyers of humanity, whereas the teachings of Baha'u'llah are the very healing of the sick world, the remedy for every need and condition. 

 In them may be found the realization of every desire and aspiration, the cause of the happiness of the world of humanity, the stimulus and ii-lumination of mentality, the impulse for advancement  and uplift, the basis of unity for all nations, the fountain-source of love amongst mankind, the center of agreement, the means of peace and harmony, the one bond which will unite the East and the 'West." 

 Those who sought no further than this preliminary discussion, conceived of the Faith as a leaven gradually penetrating the masses of mankind, urged and promoted by the enlightened and the idealistic in and through the reformation of the traditional movements and organizations. 'Abdu'l-Baha, however, plainly set forth the sovereign  quality of revealed religion, as, for example, in the following Tablet addressed to 

American Baha'is.          

 "In the contingent world there are many collective centers which are conducive to association and unity between the children of men. For example patriotism is a collective  center; nationalism is a collective center; identity of interests is a collective center; political alliance is a collective center; the union of ideals is a collective center, and the prosperity of the world of humanity is dependent upon the organization and promotion  of the collective centers. Nevertheless, all the above institutions are, in reality, the matter and not the substance, accidental and not eternal — temporary and not everlasting. 

 With the appearance of great revo


<p6>
6               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  lutions and upheavals, all these collective centers are swept away. But the collective center of the Kingdom, embodying the 

Institutes  and Divine   

 Teachings, is the eternal collective center. The real Collective Center is the body of the Divine Teachings, which include all the degrees and embrace all the unjversal relations and necessary laws of humanity." 

 Behind the principles of rational truth, therefore, we look for the deeper implications  of law and ordinance. 

    In studying Baha'u'llah's 

 laws and ordinances, we note that He revealed nothing in the form of a code or constitution. 

 His teachings represent virtues and attitudes, or deal with matters which He did not intend to be altered during this cycle. 

 The Baha'i code will come into existence through the legislative institutions which Baha'u'llah created, and whose enactments are subject to revision from time to time as conditions change. 

 The laws of Baha'u'llah include: the obligation of daily prayer; am annual fasting period of nineteen days; prohibition of use of alcoholic liquor or drugs; monogamy; marriage contingent upon the consent of all four parents, or those living; obedience to civil government; obligation to engage in a useful trade, art or profession; prohibition  of a clergy in the Ba1~'i Faith. 

 Other ordinances and directions found in His writings can be summarized as follows: Man's first duty is to know his own self and the conditions of progress and abasement.  After maturity has been attained, wealth is needed for the attainment of social  personality, and this is to be earned through the practice of a profession, art, trade or craft. Associate in a joyous spirit with the followers of all religions and the members of all races and nations. 

 The supreme  obligation is to attain a good character. 

 Through trustworthiness mankind will obtain security and tranquillity. Respect possessors of talent. 

 Meet all obligations due to others. Refrain from slander and backbiting. 

 To acquire knowledge is incumbent on all, but knowledge must be of matters useful to mankind. Agriculture is of first importance. 

 Human existence rests upon the two pillars of reward (for obedience to divine command) and punishment  (for disobedience to it). Kings and rulers are to uphold religion as the means to world order and peace. Scho6ls must train children in the principles of religion. Celibacy and seclusion from the world are not approved. 

 Warfare for religious reasons is prohibited. 

 Kings and rulers are exhorted to protect and assist the Baha'i community. Governments must appoint or elect to office  oniy such persons as have character and capacity. 

 The repentant sinner must turn to God for forgiveness and not to any human being. 

 The realm of law and ordinance is defined  and given a firm basis in the establishment of social institutions with definite functions for the Baha'i community, and the conveyance of specific authority to be effective after Baha'u'llah's ascension. t~The affairs of the peopie are placed in charge of the men of the House of Justice of God. They are the trustees of God among His servants and the daysprings of command in His countries. 

 ~ people of God! The trainer of the world is justice, for it consists of two pillars:  reward and retribution. 

 These two pillars are two fountains for the life of the people of the world. Inasmuch as for each time and day a particular decree and order is expedient, affairs are therefore entrusted to the ministers of the House of Justice, so that they may execute that which they deem advisable at the time. Those souls who arise to please God will be inspired  by the divine, invisible inspirations. It is incumbent upon all to obey." 

 The relation of this function to the spiritual  realm of the Faith has been placed beyond  the possibility of doubt and disagreement. 

 ccAdministratiye affairs," Baha'u'llah declared, "are all in charge of the House of Justice; but acts of worship must be observed  according as they are revealed in the Book." 

 The aim of this term of social and spiritual evolution has been firmly fixed. "Th ministers of the House of Justice must promote the Most Great Peace." 

 As 'Abdu'l-Baha explained in His Will and Testament, this House of Justice is art international body whose members are to be

  elected by national representatives of the Baha'is. 

 In the Person of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'u'llah established authority as Interpreter of His Revelation and Exemplar of the Faith. 

The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah

 in reality is to be viewed as more than an initial spiritual impulse breathed into the human heart and left to humanity's own devices to direct an& apply throughout an historical epoch. His Dispensation is an organism created to function  in and through the entire epoch, for divine guidance has been promised to mankind  henceforth, the day of God's Kingdom having dawned. 

   Shoghi Effendi, Guardian   

 of the Faith, has disclosed this new dimension which religion in its fulfillment has attained. ttFor Baha'u'llah, we should readily recognize, has not only imbued mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit, He has not merely enunciated  certain universal principles, or propounded a particular philosophy, however potent, sound and universal these may be. In addition to these He, as well as 'Abdu'l-Baha after Him, has, unlike the Dispensations  of the past, clearly and specifically Laid down a set of laws, established definite institutions, and provided for the essentials of a Divine Economy. These are destined to be a pattern for the future society, a supreme instrument for the establishment of the Most Great Peace, and the one agency for the unificatiQn of the world, and the proclamation of the reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth." 
                           
  BIRTH OF A WORLD FAITH     

  The inmost soul of religion is its reflection  of the divine light and iove. The Being  men call prophet, messenger or messiah, outwardly a physical man, is inwardly a flame enkindled from a higher world. By Him men arc born from their physical self to their spiritual reality. By His summons a mighty tempest is unloosed which destroys  evil attitudes, habits and patterns. To recognize Him is man's supreme blessing, to serve Him is the essence of existence. Through Him God destroys and creates, punishes and rewards, darkens and illumines all things on earth. He sends an ocean of truth to confound men's limited conceptions and lights a sun of love to replace their flickering candles of personal affection. Aside from Him there is no path to God. 

 The cherished mystery of true faith has been the sacred teaching of the Covenant which the Creator made with man, that He would not abandon the human race but send His messenger to redeem them from age to age for evermore. But the Covenant laid upon human beings the condition  that they would remain firm in the Promise and recognize and obey the Lord of the Covenant whenever, wherever, however  He might appear. 

 The proclamation uttered by Mirza 'Au-Muhammad (the Bib) in Shir~z, Persia, one hundred years ago, restored to the world in its night of darkness the power of the Holy Spirit. His manifestation offered to the people of IsUm the fulfillment of their hope; to Christians He was the return of Christ; and to Jews their assured Messiah. Against Him the inveterate forces of fanaticism, materialism and ruthless intolerance inflicted martyrdom six years after He undertook His mission to herald the imminent appearance  of Baha'u'llah. He left behind Him among the Persian people such intense devotion and faith that thousands underwent torture and death rather than forsake their love for Him. But during that six years the Rib invoked the measure of faith and new spiritual life that was required to prepare the world for the greater Manifestation to follow. 

 The Bab was martyred in Tabriz on July 9, 1850. 

 After cruel imprisonment in TihrAn, the seizure of His wealth, and exile to 

Baglidid, Baha'u'llah      

 declared His mission in the year 1863, surrounded by a small company of believers who had succeeded in accompanying Him. 

From BaghdAd, Baha'u'llah   

 was exiled successively to Constantinople, Adrianople and 'Akka, in the Holy Land, where He remained a prisoner until His ascension in 1892. Under  such conditions Baha'u'llah revealed the spiritual and social teachings for the world civilization and divine order with which His Dispensation is identified. 

 A prisoner and an exile, Baha'u'llah addressed letters to kings and rulers, to heads of religion, expounding the laws of peace

  and calling upon them to heed the counsels revealed in the Greatest Name of God. The mystery of worship, the realities of faith, the principles of conduct and the evolution of justice and order were given the world in innumerable tablets and books at a time when in th~ countries of Ishin it was a capital offense to even possess a copy of His sacred Word. 

 From 1892 until 1921, 'Abdu'l-Baha led the Baha'i community, guided its development,  inspired its efforts, clarified its teachings,  unified its members, and preserved its spiritual integrity. 

 Released from prison by the revolution in Turkey which overthrew the Sul;in, Caliph of IsUm, 'Abdu'1 — Bah& traveled from 1911 to 1913 in Egypt, Europe,  the United 

States and Canada. During 

 this journey He established the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the West and brought it into contact with innumerable public leaders  and organizations. 

 The result of this unique teaching mission was the enrichment  of Baha'i literature by the recorded addresses He delivered in Paris, London and many cities of North America. Upon the American Baha'is, 'Abdu'l-Baha laid the great responsibility for carrying the Faith to the enda of the world after His earthly work had come to an end. 

 It was 'Abdu'l-Baha, likewise, who developed  the administrative order of the Faith, guiding the progress of the Baha'is in many countries through the early stages of the local and national Baha'i communities upon which the future international Baha'i order is to rest. 

 For He, in addition to His station as Interpreter, was also appointed by Baha'u'llah to be the 

Center of His Covenant     

 with mankind. Through Him the formative and evolutionary spirit of this Dispensation carried forward the work of Baha'u'llah without interruption for thirty years, assuring the preservation of the fundamental  aim and character of the new Faith. 

 Concerning the nature of the mission bestowed upon Him by Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha  declared: "In former cycles no distinct  Covenant was made in writing by the Supreme Pen (i.e., the Manifestation);  no distinct personage was appointed to be the standard differentiating falsehood from truth But in this Dispensation of the Blessed Beauty (i.e., Baha'u'llah), among its distinctions is that He did not leave the people in perplexity. He entered into a Covenant and Testament with the people. He appointed a Center of the Covenant.~~ "One of the enemies of the Cause," 'Abdu'l-Baha warned, "is he who endeavors to interpret the Words of Baha'u'llah and thereby colors the meaning according to his capacity, and collects around him a following, forming a different sect, promoting  his own station and making division m the Cause." Acting on this truth, for the protection of the unity of the Faith, and to symbolize forever the fundamental difference between superficial tolerance and oneness of faith, 

'Abdu'l-Baha Himself       

 expelled  treacherous persons, including members of Baha'u'llah's own family, from the Cause. 

 ttHe is," the Guardian has written, "and should for all time be regarded, first and foremost, as the Center and Pivot of BaLi'-U'  11~h's peerless and all-enfolding Covenant, His most exalted handiwork, the stainless Mirror of His light, the perfect Exemplar of His teachings, the unerring Interpreter of His Word the Ensign of the Most Great Peace. 

    Since 1921 the Baha'i      

 community throughout the world has been unified and directed by the Guardian, within the administrative order set forth and established in 'Abdu'l-Baha's written 

Testament. 'Abdu'l-Baha   

 provided details for the formation  of local, national and Universal 

Houses of Justice. He      

 created the Guardianship in a line of succession through His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi; endowed this office with sole authority to interpret the Baha'i writings  after His own departure; made the Guardian the presiding officer of the future International House of Justice; attributed to him the payment of the special donation known as Huquq, and authorized the Guardian  to appoint a body to be known as the Hands of the Cause. 

 "The creative energies released by the Law of Baha'u'llah, permeating  and evolving within the mind of 'Abdu'l-Baha, have given birth to an Instrument  which may be viewed as the Charter of the New World Order which is at once the glory and the promise of this

  most great Dispensation," the Guardian explains. 

 During the present formative period, sacred writings of the Faith have been translated  into some thirtyfive languages, comprehensive  selections made by the Guardian from words of Baha'u'llah have been published, works of Baha'i history made available,  the institutions developed, and the Faith carried into thirty or more countries when the light had not penetrated in 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry. In North America, properties  have been transferred to Baha'i trustees  for educational activities in Eliot, Maine, Geyserville, California and Pine Valley, Colorado Springs, Colorado, in addition to properties dedicated as memorials to 'Abdu'l-Baha  in West 

Englewood, New Jersey     
and Maiden, Massachusetts.

 A vigorous publishing activity has long been maintained, and local communities founded in more than one hundred cities. The spiritual and administrative  activities of the American Baha'i community  revolve around the impressive House of 'Worship in "X~i1mette, Illinois, the superstructure of which was constructed in 1930 and 1931, and the exterior ornamentation completed in January, 1943. 
                          
   ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER      
                          
     The Faith of Baha'u'llah   

 expresses itself through a community and not through a church. Since this Dispensation began, the power of the Faith to assimilate and unify diverse peoples has been demonstrated with ever-increasing might. 

 Nowhere else in the world today does there exist any social body similar to the unique community which has arisen in response to His call. Spread in many parts of the world, separated by difference  of language, custom, tradition and outlook as well as by the operation of conflicting  political and economic policies in their environment, this community of believers could not be held together by personal  agreement but by a power which surrounds  them and combines them through a superhuman force. 

 The Baha community feels itself immersed  in a spiritual reality which encompasses  it as by an invisible but potent atmosphere  or sea. The influence of that surrounding spirit makes itself continuously felt, like the virtue of health in a physical organism which adjusts it to continuous growth and development. 

 The believers think of the teachings of Baha'u'llah not as doctrines but as truths which come to life in their application to problems of conduct and human association. The concept of foreignness or the alien in mankind has been replaced by the ideal of fellowship. 

 Baha'u'llah has given assurance that the process of destruction now operating is but the necessary preliminary to the process of construction which will eventually  produce the harmonious coordination of the views and feelings, the interests and the institutions, the activities and the aims of all mankind. 

 On the foundation of spiritual equality before the law and the authority of their Faith, the Baha'is maintain their community worship and activity through local, national and international institutions which distribute power and authority in accordance with the natural duties and functions of an ordered  society. 

 All that pertains to daily action is assigned to the local Spiritual Assembly  under the principle of decentraliza-don  of administrative control. 

 The local communities are coordinated by a 

National Spiritual Assembly

 elected by delegates chosen on the basis of proportionate representation.  These National Assemblies in turn will be the electoral bodies by whom the members of an International Assembly, or House of Justice, will be selected. In the delegation of authority, the source or reservoir of power lies at the Center of the world community, and duties and functions are assigned downward to the progressively smaller national and local units. 

 This order follows inevitably from the fact that the whole body of authority was created in and through Baha'u'llah and by Him assigned to His ministers and institutions as servants of mankind. Historically, the Baha'i World Order originated at the Center, unlike those social bodies which develop from local units and whose central institutions reflect a secondary and imperfectly delegated power. 

 The Baha'i thus realizes himself as part of a newly-created world, a world raised up by God above the tumults of the past, and en.

  dowed with a new destiny which the forces of disunity can assail but never destroy. The believer need no longer be partisan to the titanic struggles of competitive social values, whether capitalism, communism or state socialism-because e such conflicts can never be resolved. 

 What the world needs, He has learned, is a new mind and a new heart. 

 "This Administrative Order," Shoghi Effendi  points out, "is fundamentally different  from anything that any Prophet has previously established, inasmuch as Baha'i'  11Th has Himself revealed its principles, established its institutions, appointed the person  to interpret His Word and conferred the necessary authority on the body designed to supplement and apply His legislative ordinances. 

 Therein lies the secret of its strength, its fundamental distinction, and the guarantee against disintegration and schism. Alone of all the Revelations gone before it, this Faith has, through the explicit directions, the repeated warnings, the authenticated safeguards incorporated and elaborated in its teachings, succeeded in raising a structure which the bewildered followers of bankrupt and broken creeds might well approach and critically examine, and seek, ere it is too late, the invulnerable security of its world-embracing shelter."

               INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF
              CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES
                IN THE EAST AND WEST

                  B~ HORACE HOLLEY

  THE two years covered by this survey witnessed the ending of the second World War, the gathering of nations at San Francisco to lay the basis for an era of peace, and the widespread realization of the peoples of East and West what havoc and destruction had been inflicted on mankind, how shattered the structure of civilization, how unbalanced the world's affairs, and how long and painful the road to regeneration, recovery and a sound '~ror1d order. 

 This was the conflict which the world did not need as warning but incurred as punishment.  Warning of disaster had been signalled by World War One clear enough for a child to understand; but humanity had ceased to be a child and failed to become the mature man. 

 Humanity had arrived at that stage of development which lies between the infant and the adult: the stage when the soul must worship but cannot distinguish between God and His betrayer; when the mind can know, but understands not the difference between knowledge of truth and knowledge of error; when the heart feels urgently the clamor of self-preservation in every awareness of self-sacrifice; when the simple things are complicated  so as to serve at once the terror of the slave and the cruelty of the tyrant, and every experience holds up the distorting mirror making beauty to be a beast and a beast to be beauty. Therefore the warning could be evaded, misapplied, buried with pomp beneath  the monument of a formula of unity committed to the disunited, until pressure of concern for personal, family or community security could absorb all attention, employ all energy, and conceal the monstrous shape of world insecurity behind a screen of smoke. 

 Had there been no warning, and no evasion  of it, there could have been no punishment.  World War Two was punishment and not misfortune because it brought into the arena of military operations a final determination to command not merely the person but the mind and spirit of the vanquished. It opened to the processes of war waged with the infinite resources of the scientific intelligence a subjective difference of attitude and value which can only be resolved through mutual appeal to divine truth and law. 

 Warfare  which had begun by slaying human bodies for the sake of lands ended by destroying lands in order to seize what God bad conferred  as His gift to mankind. 

 The significance of warning is only partly discerned by assuming it threatens suffering. The moral validity of warning consists in the fact that with its threat of punishment for breaking the law stands assurance of reward when the law has been obeyed. 

 This assurance  exists only in the revelation by the prophet of the divine will. Because Baha'u'llah  offered the kings, the leaders and the peoples the blessing of peace, the road to war could no longer be claimed as a dire neces-sky. 

 Necessity and pressure in human affairs which produce evil are the clear sign that the divine will has already been manifested and its authority denied. 

 "What entered the first war were nations and empires. 

 When these were shattered, the 13

  conditions for world order had been attained. What entered the second war were theories of the nature of civilization and of man. When these were condemned by destiny, the conditions for a political and economic world order had been transformed. 

 The second world war released the flood of psychological as well as material destruction which can only be stayed by the power of a world religion.  When men denied peace they denied themselves. 

 Now we may have peace on God's terms or there is no peace. 

 The selection of San Francisco for the Allied  Nations Conference seemed truly providential  to the Baha'is. 

 They recalled the messages which 'Abdu'l-Baha revealed in city after city during His visit to America in 1912 concerning universal peace — His appeals  that its social basis be laid in America and His assurance that the banner of peace would be unfurled in that land. 

 For example, in Washington, D. C. He said: "May this American democracy be the first nation to establish the foundation of international peace. 

 May it be the first nation to proclaim the universality of mankind." In Cleveland He said: ttThis revered American nation presents evidences of greatness and worth. It is My hope that this just government will stand for peace so that warfare may be abolished throughout the world and the standards of international unity and reconciliation be upraised.  This is the greatest attainment of the world of humanity." 

 In New York: "The powers of earth cannot withstand the privileges  and bestowaL which God has ordained for this great and glorious century. It is a need and exigency of the time. 

 Man can withstand anything except that which is divinely  intended and indicated for the age and its requirements. 
Now, praise be to God!     

 in all countries of the world, lovers of peace are to be found and these principles are being spread among mankind, especially in this country. There is no doubt that this wonderful democracy will be able to realize it, and the banner of international agreement will be unfurled here to spread onward and outward among all the nations of the world." In 

Sacramento 'Abdu'l-Baha     

 declared: "The time is ripe. It is time for the abolition of warfare, the unification of nations and governments.  It is the time for love. It is time for cementing together the East and the West. 

 Inasmuch as the Californians seem peace-loving and possessed of great worthiness and capacity, I hope that advocates of peace may daily increase among them until the whole population shall stand for that beneficent outcome. May the first flag of International Peace be upraised in this State. 

 Unresponsive as the masses of mankind were to the revelation of truth and law through Baha'u'llah, He had a hearer and a witness and a perfect responder in 'Abdu'l-Baha,  as if 'Abdu'l-Baha had been appointed to be a trustee of the true spiritual interests of all humanity. 

 His words are significant first because they fully express the purpose of the word of Baha'u'llah; and second because  they are a testimony uttered on behalf of a world that could later, by evolution, attain to a collective and unified obedience to divine truth and will. 

 But the Baha'is during this period had their own communal experience in addition to the public events affecting all peoples. •In their observance of the Centenary of the Declaration of the Mb the various local and national Baha'i communities felt associated with a pure, clear Spirit through whom the world had been called to God. 

 They felt that a victory had been won in which human beings can share. 

 They rose to an hour of lofty elation. Nothing else in human life, they knew, could matter as it matters to be aware of the Person of the Prophet of God, adore God through Him, and through Him learn to know mankind. 

 With the ending of hostilities the Baha also looked for the restoration of their international  spiritual community, sundered by the war. Palestine once more could function as the world center; Burma and Germany regain independence to act; England and France recover from their wounds; Japan and China return to the family of nations; Russia accept the common obligations of mankind and learn the mystery of interdependence: this hope stirred among the Baha'is  as at the war's end they looked for the coming of the great, the universal peace. 

 The Baha'is also, the most important and far-reaching event in the Centenary programs,  received from the Guardian his work

  on the history of the Faith during its first hundred years, ~tGod Passes By." 

 The structure  of this unique document is revealed in its table of contents. 

 It opens with the Guardian's Foreword which summarizes the events of the first Baha'i century, explains the significance of the Faith, and defines the purpose and scope of his book. 

 This is followed  by an introduction written by Dr. George Townshend and signed by him with his title and rank then held in the Church of England. 

 Chapters one to five present the Mission of the Bab and cover the first perioc of Baha'i history, 1844 to 1853. 

 Chapters six to thirteen summarize the Ministry of Baha'u'llah, the second historical period extending from 1853 to 1892. 

 The third period represents the Ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and chapters fourteen to twenty-one outline its principal events and meanings from 1892 to 1921. 

 Chapters-twenty-two  to twenty-five explain  the rise and development of the administrative order, the fourth period, from 1922 to 1944, and the work closes with a chapter entitled Retrospect and Prospect. 

 What Shoghi Effendi has given us in this volume is a new dimension of spiritual truth — an authentic history of a revealed religion throughout its first one hundred years of action  upon human existence. In no previous cycle has this been accomplished: a presentation  of the Figure of the Manifestation and of His disciples and 

His Exemplar and Interpreter 

 created by one so spiritually endowed  that he can turn back to the Person and the sacred Events and give them actual reproduction at a later time. 

 By virtue of the Guardian's power to experience  the history of the Faith as a living and vital present force and not merely a past event, the days of the Mb and the days of Baha'u'llah live for us again. We can in this book behold once more the episode of the Declaration of the Bib, His imprisonment and His execution, the sufferings inflicted upon Baha'u'llah, His exile from land to land and eventual incarceration in 'Akka; and the moving record of the Master's services  by which the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah      

 was firmly planted in East and West. A clear light is thrown upon all the significant epi-. 

 sodes and events — the revelation of Ba1A'u'-ilili's  principal works and an analysis of His essential teachings; the rise and fall of the great betrayers and deniers of God's holy Cause; and the forces which transferred the power of action in the Baha'i community from Persia to America. 

 Thanks to this book the Baha'is have the infinite privilege of living within a fully unified  world — the world of spirit and the world of humanity acted upon by divine forces for a divinely ordained end. 

   Therefore the Baha'is      

 have been able tG look beyond the event and the condition, however disturbing it has been, to the Power which has employed it for its own purpose. The Baha'is have looked upon the development of the greatest cQncentration of human energy, science, mechanical equipment and social will the world has ever created, summoned by the dire urgency of battle — a massive  force which nothing could withstand; a force able to move mountains and divert seas, command the ether and explode the universe within the atom, all for victory in war. This energy they have seen dissipated, undone and turned into weakness when the supreme issue became not war but peace. They have seen the League of Nations go into receivership, not because peace is impos —  sible but because it had not been willed; and they have drawn parallels between the Charter  of United Nations and the Baha'i princi-pie  of world order which indicate how far we still are even from the CCL Peace" which has been ordained in this age as the preliminary stage leading to the "Most Great Peace" of divine intention and effect. 
                           
ALLIED NATIONS CONFERENCE  

  The calling of an Allied Nations Conference  at 

San Francisco on April     

 25, 1945, offered an ideal occasion for bringing the Baha'i Peace Program to the notice of responsible leaders and the general public throughout America. 

 The theme of peace had been made dominant  in the public teaching plans a the American Baha'is throughout the preceding year. 

 A compilation of 'Abdu'l-Baha's American addresses entitled ttFdti of World Unity" had been reprinted; a new collection of Baha'i teachings entitled 

"Peace:

  A Divine Creation" had been made available; a national committee had distributed by mail, with the help of local Assemblies, more than 25,000 copies of a series of four broadsides on peace; and the local Assemblies had been requested to hold one or more public meetings or conferences on peace. 

 These efforts to eleyate a spiritual aflirma-don of peace during the final period of the war seemed to culminate in the unique opportunity  afforded by so responsible an undertaking  as the Allied Nations Conference proposed to carry out. 

  A Committee on Baha'i      

 Peace Plan was therefore appointed, with a membership centered  in San Francisco, to explore the possibilities for the conduct of a public demonstration of Baha'i teachings on peace and bring the teachings to the attention of the conference delegates in a suitable manner. 

 The outcome was profoundly gratifying. No other spiritual concept of peace made such an impression. The committee prepared an admirable pamphlet, ttBah&"r Peace Program,"  a thirty-minute radio recording on "World Order Is the Goal" was prepared which was not oniy broadcast in San Francisco  but later used in nearly forty other cities. 

 A symposium on the subject of the Baha'i Peace Program presented Dr. Rudolph HoistS, former delegate to the League of Nations  from 

Finland, Dorothy Beecher   

 Baker, Marion Holley and Leroy loas to an audience of about 650 persons. A banquet was soon afterward arranged for the friends of Dr. HoistS participating in the Allied Nations Conference. 

 Some fifty guests were honored, among them His 

Excellency, Francisco      
Gas-tub  Najera, Mexican   

 Ambassador and its delegate to the conference; His Excellency, Ivan Kerno, delegate from CzechoSlovakia and its Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary; Dr. Li Shu-Fan, Adviser to the Chinese delegation; Dr. Carlos Rodriguiz Jiminez, Secretary to the Venezuelan delega-don  and Consul General; and M. Aiphone Ak, Adviser to the Luxembourg delegation. 

 Two official observers representing the National Spiritual Assembly attended the con. ference sessions; 

Marion Holley and Sylvia Loas.

 Three Baha'i exhibits were maintained in San Francisco; at least 4200 copies of the peace pamphlet were presented to conference delegates and San Francisco citizens; the local Assembly of the city conducted for thirteen weeks a series of radio talks on the theme, "Foundations of Universal Peace." Later editions of the pamphlet gave wide distribution of the text throughout the country. 

 Shortly after the plans for the Allied Nations Conference had been published, the National Assembly addressed the following telegram to the President at the 'White House, 

Washington:                

 ~tIt is the prayerful hope of the American Baha'is that your Excellency, chief magistrate  of the American nation and symbol of its destiny at this great turning-point in human history, will be spiritually guided and reinforced to lead the nations and peoples of the world in the inauguration of universal peace. 

 We recall with reverence and devotion  the exalted mission upheld for America by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1912 when He traveled from city to city promulgating the principles of universal peace and in the city of Washington  declared: tMay this American democracy be the first nation to establish the foundation of international agreement. 

 May it be the first to upraise the standard of the Most Great Peace and through this nation of democracy may these philanthropic intentions  and institutions be spread broadcast throughout the world. Truly this is~ a great and revered nation. Here liberty has reached its highest degree. The intentions of its people  are most praiseworthy. They are indeed worthy of being the first people to build the tabernacle of the great peace and proclaim  the oneness of mankind. I will supplicate  God for assistance and confirmation in your behalf.' May the dire needs of humanity be met by the creation of a new world order through the efforts of the forthcoming conference in San Francisco under your leadership."

  Baha'is of Esslingen, and neighboring districts, Germany, hold a joyful reunion with John Eichenauer present, a young American Baha'i attached to a Medical Unit of the U. S. Army, on August 26, 1945. 

  ized to reorganize and to hold religious meetings within the City. This notice, signed by Carvel Busey, served to end the ban which had been laid on the German Baha'i institutions  and activities by the Nazi regime. 

 We have details concerning this suppression  of the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah       

 in Germany from Baha'is who suffered under it, as we in previous years had statements of fact concerning  the suppression of Baha'i activities in southern Russia by the Soviet party. 

 The last summer school held at Esslingen in 1936 and the National Baha'i 

Convention of Heidelberg   

 in May 1937 demonstrated a culminating point in the history of the Faith in Germany, as they proved the brilliant achievement of a period of strenuous teaching  and administrative efforts. The reports about the last meetings of the German pilgrims  with the Guardian in Haifa were presented  before the Convention and shared by the believers. 

 The first signs of impending persecutions of the Cause occurred a little earlier in Stutt gart, where a threatening article against the Faith was published in a national socialist youth paper of Stuttgart and the doorplate of the Bah&i-Buro of the town was stolen by unknown culprits. 

 On May twenty-first, 1937 the Faith and its administrative institutions were interdicted by special order of the Reichsfuhrer SS and chief of the German police Heinrich Himmier, published by the newspapers in June 1937. Events then followed rapidly and the efforts of Mr. Max Greeven to obtain an annulment of that given order were in vain. Also the several personal efforts of Mr. Otto Geidreich, believer of Stuttgart, following the sanie purpose at the Geheime Staatspolizei of his town, had no results.. 

 By confiscation of the stock, all the books and leaflets of the BaM'i-Verlag and the Bah&'i-Esperanto-Eldonelo, as well as "Sonne der Vahrheit" and "La Nova Tago," also the archives of the National Spiritual Assembly and local Assemblies, the greater part of private books and even personal souvenirs were


<p21>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             21

  lost, while the Geheime Staatspolizei of Heidelberg, by request, explicitly stated that private possession of Baha'i books and visits among the Triends, even in larger numbers, were not prohibited. Mr. Emil Join, believer of Warnemunde, was not allowed to write to or meet any one of the believers. 

     In 1939 Mrs. Marta Brauns-Fore

 of Karis —  ruhe, member of the National Spiritual Assembly,  had to undergo domiciliary visit, her books and correspondence being confiscated, and she herself cross-examined for four hours in a most rude and scoffing manner. Due to a letter of Mrs. Anna Grossmann of Neckar-gemund, member of the National Spiritual Assembly, found at Mrs. Brauns', Mrs. Gross-mann  was questioned by the officer of the Geheime Staatspolizei Gerst of Karisruhe, probably one of the examiners of Mrs. 

Brauns                    

 — although the letter did not contain any word about the Cause. As no matter of complaint could be found, she was officially admonished f or having kept "suspicious relations  to a former member of the National and Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is, a certain 

Frau Brauns in Karisruhe."

 A copy of one of the daily prayers of Baha'u'llah, mul-tigraphed  by Mr. Paul Kohier, believer of Dresden, which was found at the said domiciliary  visit, gave basis fdr a sentence of a lower court (Amtagericht) of Dresden, condemning Mr. Kohier to six months of prison. (Some years later he died by an accident.) 

 The third and most menacing wave of persecutions arose in 1943, when Mrs. Carla Macco, believer of Heidelberg, was suddenly put into prison due to defamatory accusations  of a political character. It is to be supposed  that the center of all the subsequent trials and persecutions was the said Officer Gerst from the Geheime Staatspolizei of Karisruhe, who had already been the initiator of the second wave of attacks leading finally to the imprisonment of Mr. Kohier. 

 As the calumnious character of the accusations of Mrs. Macco became evident she was then accused of being an active Baha'i. 

 Then, based on falsified records of her sayings before the Geheime Staatspolizei, by sentence of the Sondergericlit Mannheim, executed through order of the Amtagericht of Heidelberg from 21.2.1944 she was condemned to six months of imprisonment. 

 These falsifications also laid basis to the then following accusations and condemnations of a number of other believers, in spite of Mrs. Macco's hardest efforts to prove tefore the courts the mendacity  of the records taken by the Geheime Staatspolizei. 

 An advocation in Mrs. Macco's plea was almost impossible, as nobody was allowed to get in touch with the prisoner and even her advocate had no chance to know the accusations charged upon her, nor partake at the session of the Sondergericht. Only after tnumber of weeks 

Dr. iHermann Grossmann    

 and Mrs. Anna Grossmann, from Neckargemun, succeeded in clearing up the facts when they, on their own part, were examined at the Geheime Staatspolizei of Karisruhe, thus being able to give a chance to the son of Mrs. Macco, the late Mr. Fritz Macco, also a devoted believer of Heidelberg, to see his mother and shield her from being transferred to a concentration camp. 

 On December 1, 1943, the examiner Gcrst came for domiciliary visit to the homes of Miss Elsa 

Maria Grossmann and Dr.   
Hermann and Mrs. Anna     
Grossmann at Neckargemund 

 and Miss Frida Eichler at Heidelberg, believers belonging to the Local Assembly of Heidelberg.  Miss Elsa 

Maria Grossmann and Frida Lichier

 were examined most rudely and in a threatening, manner, Miss Grossmann even menaced by a pistol. 

 All their private Baha'i books and literature, and even private correspondence and objects not at all referring to the Cause nor to Baha'i persons, were taken off and kept. 

    Dr. Hermann Grossmann     

 lost the greater part of his extremely valuable Baha'i library and archives, which had to be destroyed, including  nearly all his documents and records concerning the development of the Faith in Germany, which he had gathered at great effort over a period of twenty years. Only a part was allowed, at Dr. Grossmann's plea, to be given to the University Library of Heidelberg, which accepted it most gratefully  and treated it with care and attention. Thus the University Library of Heidelberg has become the first one in flermany to possess  an important collection of materials on the Faith Elsa Maria Grossmann was arrested and without assigning reasons, kept for nine days at Heidelberg in a prison cell, No. 19: Further interrogations were carried


<p22>
22              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  out by the Geheime Staatspolizei of Karis-ruhe  in Heppenheim an der Bergstrasse, Darmstadt, Stuttgart, Esslingen, 

Goppingen and Dresden.    

 The diverse examinations entirely  agreed on the same truth that all the questioned believers had abstained from any proceeding which might have been contrary to the prohibition of May 21, 1937, and the explanations given to it by the Geheime Staatspolizei of Heidelberg. They also stated clearly the unpolitical attitude of the believers who did not deviate even in the slightest from the principles of the Faith. Neverthe-icss, on May 2, 1944, the first great public judicial proceedings were taken against seven of the believers and friends of the Cause questioned before the Sondergericlit of Darmstadt.  Here are the names of the accused: Mr. Hans Gajus Schmidt, believer of Hep-penheim and his wife Mrs. Maragareta Schmidt, the believers Mr. August and Mrs. Maria Ehiers of Klingental near Heppenheim, Mrs. 

Marie Schenk of Nieder-Ramstadt
near Darmstadt, Mrs. Anna 

Marie Schweizer of Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen

 and Mrs. Anna Grossmann of Neckargemund, falsely accused of "having continued the organization of the dissolved and prohibited Baha'i sect," and here the names of the public prosecutor Staatsanwalt Mayer and the judges: Landge-nchtsdirektor  Rode, president, Oberamss —  richter Dr. Doerr, Landgerichtsrat Dr. Friedrich, assistant judges. The defendants were defended with admirable courage and warm understanding for the Faith by two wellknown counsels, the late Herr Carl Neuschaffer from 

Darmstadt and Herr Edwin 
Leonhard from Heidelberg. 

 Strange to say, the persecutions during all that time did not pay attention'to Dr. Gross-mann  personally, in spite of his share in the German Baha'i work. 

 Thus he got the great chance to fight for the Cause of Baha'u'llah at the 

Centre of Geheime Staatspolizei

 of Karisruhe, as well as before the tribunals of Darmstadt and Heidelberg, where he succeeded  in being admitted as a witness for the defendants. He explicitly stated the absolute  nonpolitical character of the Faith and the attitude of the believers, pleading for a just treatment of the Ba1A'is, who oniy cling to a Faith, which must be regarded as the firmest foundation for any sound order in their respective countries, as well as in the world as a whole. He asked the Geheime Staatspolizei to make an effort in order to clear up the matter and lead to an abolition of the interdiction. 

 As a matter of fact, the accusation of staatsfeindlichkeit was not supported further but oniy maintained as a transgression of the prohibition. Thus the persecutions could temporarily be reduced to a iess dangerous character, yet restricting to the least degree any chance of contact for the majority of the believers. 

 He as well as the accused Baha'is, when asked about the international character of the Cause, stated that the Faith stands for a Universal Order, which does not exclude national order. They further especially opposed the attempt made of regarding the Cause as staatsfeindlich (hostile to the state), a proceeding, which entirely disregarded the attitude of the Ba —  hA'is throughout the world, as well as in Germany. 

  At the Sondergericlit's   

 trial in Darmstadt it happened for the first time that a larger number of Baha'is stood before the bar of a German tribunal. 

 The spirit of the Cause of Baha'u'llah revealed itself very strongly there and its majesty and power became evident in each one of the believers present. Particularly Mrs. Schweizer showed a most genial  and unique manner of spiritual superiority and leadership in picturing the essentials of the Faith. The trial at this court, as well as all examinations at other places, culminated in the question raised by the inquirers if the believers would continue to uphold the Cause, and in their clear confession of the 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.     

 On June 27, 1944, there took place a trial before the Amtsgericht of Heidelberg against the two believers Miss Frida Eichler and the twenty-year-old Ruth Espenlaub from Gap-pingen, who both were accused of the same trespasses as the believers before the Sonder-gericht  of Darmstadt. This trial, contrary to the one of Darmstadt, had a public character  and, strange action of Providence! —  while the Baha'is were deprived of every possibility of teaching the Cause privately or in a public way, here the public prosecutor gave a clear statement of the history and principles of the Faith, as well as of the claim of Baha'u'llah.

  also of these believers revealed most emphatically the greatness and victory of the Cause. 

 The judges had declared before the tribunals that they intended to extinguish the Cause in Germany, but the Almighty Army of Baha'u'llah was stronger than the forces of His enemies: lacking any chance to maintain their false accusations and attempts made to the Cause and its believers, the judges had finally to abstain from any condemnation which might have attacked the lives and property of the Baha'is. A part of them was fined and had to pay large sums of money, these were the accused of Darmstadt and Heidelberg. The same happened later on to Dr. 

Hermann Grossmann and Miss 

 Elsa Maria Grossmann, who all of a sudden were sentenced to pay a fine or six months in prison for the first and one month for the latter. 

 The persecutions seemed to have come to an end and the subsequent political occurrences  demonstrated that the enemies of the Cause had really finished their game. At every place in Germany where the light of the Faith had been enkindled, the believers with unceasing endeavor tried to keep the full splendor of its glory. An eventful chapter of the development of the Faith in this country has come to a dose. At the end of this record stand the names of those who lost their lives on the battlefields, amongst them some of our promising Baha'i youth, or by other war-events. These are, as far as for the moment it can be recorded, their names: Jorg Brauns of Karisruhe, Wilhelm Golimer of Stuttgart, Hansjoorg Kohier of Stuttgart-Unterturkhcim, 

Fritz Macco of Heidelberg  

 and Alfred Schweizer of Stutt-gart-Zuffenhausen. 

 The fate of other young friends is still unknown. By other war events died Mrs. Else Gricke and her two little daughters Margot and Rita, all from Leipzig. The fate of four Jewish believers of Frankfort, i.e. Miss Sophie Rothschild from Weinheim and the three Werthheimer sisters is still unknown. They were deported, as far as can be remembered, in November

  Authority issued by Allied Expeditionary Force Military Government, through Carvel

 Busey Education and Religion Officer for reorganization of Stuttgart Baha'i community ity and holding of its religious meetings This official permit, terminating (for Stuttgart at least) the period of dissolution enforced upon the Baha'i community by the Nazi regime almost ten years ago, was granted on application made by John Eichenauer, III, American Baha'i serving in the army in a noncombatant capacity. 

  1941, and it is supposed that they are no longer alive. Up to the last moment before their deportation, friends of Frankfurt, Darmstadt and Neckargemund took care of them, while in the Ghetto, at the risk of their lives. Edith Horn was present at Miss Rothschild's  at the very moment when Sophie and her neighbors were called for deportation. 

 May the sacrifices of their lives and the fact that none of the living believers — as far as the writers of this record are informed — flinched or budged, even for a single moment, in the profession of their faith, become the foundation stone of a new era of development of the Cause in Germany and lead, in connection with the brilliant achievements of the believers all over the world, at the top those of their American friends, to the final establishment of the 'World Order of Baha'u'llah, Whose Faith we all love more than our lives. 

 The permit to resume practice of their re ligion given by the American Army of Occupation  in August, 1945, enabled the German  Baha'is in the western zones to restore their shattered community. Publication of Baha'i literature was resumed to the extent possible under severe restriction of paper; public gatherings were arranged; and by early 

April 1946 the Baha'i      

 affairs had been reordered on such a scale that a national convention of Baha'is in the American zone was called. 

 That historic conference elected a National  Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is for the first time since 1937. The following report was prepared by John Eichenauer III, whose vigorous support of the Baha interests  in Germany contributed so much to its early restoration: In accordance with decisions arrived at by seven former N.S.A. members in counsel with two American believers, Sgt. Bruce Davison of Miami, Florida, and Sgt.

  Eichenauer of Phoenix, Arizona, in an organizational meeting held Sunday evening, 17 March 1946, in the home of Fraulein Anna K6stlin, 1 W'ehrneckarstrassc, 

Ess-lingen,  a Convention  

 Call was issued to the Baha'i Communities, Groups and isolated believers in the American Zone. The 19 delegates of the four communities of Ess-lingen, 

Frankfurt, Heidelberg      

 and rrank-fun  would come together Saturday and Sunday, 6 and 7 April, in Stuttgart. 

 On Saturday  evening there would be a semi-public meeting (limited because of space) in the Baha'i Center, 20 Olgastrasse, for the presentation  of annual reports. Sunday morning the delegates would meet at the home of Herr Paul Goilmer, 127 Neckarstrasse, to elect the N.S.A. and the rest of the day the N.S.A. would spend in consultation. 

 Some 1 50 believers from all over the American Zone gathered in a reconstructed, bomb-damaged room, about 5:00 p.m., Saturday,  6 April. Loving hands had converted this workers' dining room at 20 Olgastrasse into a hail of dignity and beauty, an important site of Baha'i history. 

 Flowers and green sprigs decorated the tables of the audience  and the speaker's rostrum. Many long interrupted friendships were renewed and far-reaching plans were laid for spreading the 

Cause.                     

 Mr. Eichenauer was presented to the delegates  and spoke to them in German. 

 "Dear Baha friends, on this momentous occasion, let me convey the cordial greetings of our beloved Guardian to each and every one. In a letter dated 13 March and received here on 1 April, he urges everyone to write to him of his experiences during the war and since the end of the war. His address is Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, Post Office Box 155, Haifa, 

Palestine.                 

 "We are very honored in having present with us today a dear Baha'i brother from Red Bank, New Jersey, Captain Henry Jar —  vis, recently returned from long service in the Pacific where he met the Australian Baha'is. 

 You all know our dear brother from Miami, Florida, Sgt. Bruce Davison, the organizer of the Frankfurt Assembly. 

 Let me also tell you how privileged I feel to be present with you today. 

 C(We all know the high purpose of these meetings today and tomorrow, to choose a National Spiritual Assembly that will in time join other National Assemblies in establishing  the International House of Justice as directed by Baha'u'llah. I urge you all to devote your utmost to the success of this convention thru careful use of the voting privilege and full discussion of common problems and plans for the future, such as public meetings in new. cities, fireside meetings  for preparing new believers, publication of literature and preparation of radio programs. 

 1725 Captain Henry Jarvis, newly arrived from the Orient and America, was introduced and conveyed the following message: (in German) "Dear Baha'i friends, I am very happy to be here today and to see the re-establish-ment  of the N.S.A. I hope that the Baha'i Faith will flourish and endure in Germany. I left America oniy two months ago and bring greetings from the American Baha'is to all German Baha'is."

 Outstanding were the series of public meetings held in December with a total attendance  of about 400. 

   1743 Elderly Fri. Edith    

 Horn was timid in appearance but thrilling in her narrative  of Baha'i work in Frankfurt since 1937 and since Sgt. Bruce Davison first contacted them in September, 1945. 

 Starting with a small group of believers, Sgt. 

Davison organized a Local  

 Spiritual Assembly in about six weeks and arranged for Dr. Gross-mann  of Heidelberg to speak to an audience of 200 about the Cause. 

 1751 Dr. Hermann Grossmann, editor of Baha'i Nachrichten (Baha'i News) which first came forth on 19 Jan. 46, gave an eloquent discourse on activities in Heidelberg and Neckargemfind and surrounding area. He was fined and falsely accused by the Nazis during the war for his Baha'i stand and is one of the most active Baha'is in Germany today.

World Order Magazine      

 of U. S. and Canada, is almost ready to go to press with a leading article of the history of the Faith in Germany since Dr. Fisher, an American dentist first proclaimed it in Stuttgart in 1905.

THE ELECTION OF THE NATIONAL
                           
    SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY         

  Neckarstrasse is one of the main avenues in Stuttgart and was one of the most beautiful.  Today it is lined with fire.-gutted and bombed-out buildings. 

 One leaves the center of the city by this street and after a short walk in the direction of Bad Cannstatt (north), there looms a four-story dwelling which for some unknown reason escaped the destruction of the buildings surrounding it. The street number is 127. The name plate on the entrance to the fourth story apartment  is Golimer. 

 This humble site, the home of the Chairman of the N.S.A. of Stuttgart, saw the rebirth  of the 

National Spiritual Assembly
of the Baha'is of Germany. 

 The nineteen delegates and three American visitors, Captain Henry Jarvi~ and 

Sgts. Bruce Davison and John

 Eichenauer, met in the living room of the-Goilmer  apartment about 8:00 a.m. Sunday, 7 April. A beautiful painting of 'Abdu'l-Baha hanging from one of the walls of the exquisitely furnished chamber watched over the proceedings. Several days before the host and Sgt. Eichenauer invited the Religious  Affairs 

Officer of Military Government 

 for Wuerttemberg-Baden, Dr. Karl J. Arndt, to be present, but he was not able to accept the invitation because of other pressing duties. 

 The Convention Officers, Chairman, Dr. Hermann Grossmann, and Secretary, Dr. Adeiheid Koller-Jiiger were elected by the delegates on Saturday previous to the public meeting.

Dear Sir:                  

 Under the authorization of freedom of worship as contained in American Military Government directives, approximately 120 Baha'is of the Local Spiritual Assemblies of the cities of Stuttgart, Esslingen, Heidelberg and Frankfurt, will, by 1 April, elect, according  to proportionate representation, 19 delegates, who will meet at 127 

Neckar                     

 strasse, Stuttgart, on Sunday, 7 April, to elect an administrative, religious body of nine members, to be known as the "National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Germany,"  in that so% of the .Baha'is in Germany reside in the American 

Zone of Occupation.        

 The Chairman of the Stuttgart Assembly, Herr Paul Goilmer, 127 Neckarstrasse, has been authorized by the four Baha'i Assemblies  to make the necessary arrangements for the election. Sgt. 

 Robert Bruce Davison, AFN, Frankfurt, APO 757, and Sgt.-John  C. Eichenauer III, will assist the German Baha'is as representatives of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, and as members of the Baha'i Communities of Miami. Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona. 

The two American Baha'is    

 will report the results of the election to American Military Government for Wiirtremberg-Baden, to the Baha'i National Office, 536 Sheridan Road, SXfilmette, Illinois, and to the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, Shoghi Effendi,

  1. On Saturday evening, 6 April 1946, from 1700 to 2000 hours, the nineteen delegates  elected by the Baha Communities of Stuttgart, Heidelberg, 

Frankfurt and Ess-lingen   

 met at the Baha'i Center, 20 Olga-strasse,  Stuttgart, with about 150 members of the Faith who came from various cities in the 

American Zone. Annual      

 reports were given of all communities and a moving picture  film was shown of Baha'i Summer School activities at Esslingen before the prohibition in 1937. 

 2. On Sunday morning the nineteen delegates  met at the home of the Chairman of the Local Stuttgart Assembly, 127 Neckar-. strasse, and by secret ballot elected the following persons as members of the National Spiritual Assembly. They in turn elected the following officers: Dr. Hermann Grossmann,

SERVICES OF AMERICAN BAHA'IS
                           
   IN THE ARMED FORCES        

  In the restoration of religious rights to the German Baha'is we find that outstanding  services were rendered by three American  believers in the armed forces: Eichen-auer, 

Davison and Jarvis. Captain

 Jarvis also aided and encouraged the Baha'is in France while stationed in that country. The written testimony is not complete. Concerning the important services rendered by Mr. Alvin Blurn in New Zealand and also in the Philippines,  we have available the text of a brief statement he prepared for World Order Magazine, July, 1946. 

 On Sept. 1, 1942, my outfit sailed from San Francisco, and twenty-three days later


<p31>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             31

  The Hadiqatu'r-RahmAn (burial place of the Nayriz martyrs) of AbAdih, Persia, wrecked and burned by a fanatical mob. 

  I arrived in the harbor of New Meauer on the island of New Caledonia. A few days later, because of adverse war conditions, we moved south to New Zealand, and it was here that I miraculously spent twenty-eight of the thirty-eight months overseas. I say miraculously because my whole division went back to the fighting zone, and just a handful were left. 

 It was in 1924 that mother and father Dunn came to New Zealand to do pioneer work, and the result of their efforts was a flourishing Baha'i Community which I contacted through the Public Library. 

 I was the first American Baha'i to come to New 

Zealand  since Martha    
Root's visit in 1939.     

 The friends promptly put me to work, and engagements  were made to speak before many organizations and groups. The eyes of New Zealanders were particularly on America for the assistance rendered them during the war, and so at the outset, I was in a favorable position and as a soldier of the American Army many doors were opened for me. 

 On my several iurloughs the Spiritual 

Assembly of Auckland      

 arranged that I visit other cities in New Zealand. 
In Wellington, Mrs. Phillis

Eames (first Baha'i       

 of Wellington),  assisted me greatly, and several talks were given, one to the Theosophists of Wellington.  Another furlough enabled me to conduct a series of lectures in Napier. 

 This was real pioneering as no Baha'is are there. The Auckland Assembly arranged for advance  publicity before my going there. 

 A slide of the picture of the Temple was flashed on the screen once every evening for a week at one of the local theatres. 

 Miss Valerie Joyce, a member of the youth group in Auckland, assisted me. (She is a nurse and stationed at a hospital nearby.) A fine group of people turned out for these lectures, and followup work is to be carried on by the Auckland Assembly. 

 Later I visited a town one hundred miles north of Auckland known as Whangarei and here was ably assisted by Mrs. Parkins, an isolated believer. 

 It was while ordering a sign for the Gov-eminent that I got to talking to three young men in the print shop. (They are all Baha'is


<p32>
32              THE BAHA'! WORLD

  today and very active.) 

 These fellows augmented a youth group I was conducting and a Baha'i youth group was later formed. 

 During my stay in New Zealand, I noticed a weekly column written in the Auckland paper known as the tStar.3~ This column was written by the Rev. C. Chandler, and I was attracted by the spiritual quality of his writings and his liberal point of view. I was most fortunate in meeting the Rev. Chandler. 

 We immediately became fast friends, and he invited me to spend a week end at his home in Cambridge, which I did when I received my next furlough. Cambridge is a little town of about five thousand and just a little bit of old England. 

 During my stay there I spoke in his church and his parish house. 

 In celebration of the Baha'i Centennial in May, 1944, the Community of Auckland decided to give a dinner and invited the outstanding members of leading organizations and thinkers throughout New Zealand. Close to three hundred people attended, and it was a privilege to be asked to be chairman of this occasion. As leading speakers we had the local 

Orthodox Jewish Rabbi     
Astor, Rev. Chas. Chandler,

Mr. AuChu (a Chinese      

 lawyer),  Mrs. Owens representing the Maoris (the natives of New Zealand), and Mr. Old-field  representing the Quest Club, a liberal, outstanding Christian movement in 

New Zealand.              

 It was December 19, 1944, when I left New Zealand. 

 I landed April 2, 1945, on the Island of Leyte, part of the Philippine Archipelago. 

 Knowing that I was going to the Philippines, I contacted American friends who wrote inc that there was a group of Baha'is in the town of Solano. 

 This is about 250 miles north of Manila on the 

Island of Luzon. When     

 I arrived on the Island of Leyte, I found this group could not be contacted by mail because of Japanese occupation.  This territory was opened later by the American forces in June, 1945. 

 When I heard that Solano was cleared, I asked for a three clay pass and, upon receipt of it, hitchhiked to Solano. The history of how this group started is quite interesting. Mrs. Loulie Mathews during a trip around the world left some pamphlets in the public library in Manila (which is now completely destroyed). A Mr. Felix Maddela of Solano picked up these pamphlets and immediately wrote to America for more information about our beloved Faith. Through his efforts quite a few accepted the Faith in Solano, and over $400.00 worth of books had been cob-lected  in their Baha'i Center which was completely destroyed by the conflict that raged in this area. 

 Not only was the Baha'i Center destroyed but all of the homes of the Baha'is as well as the whole city. 

 The only thing remaining when they came back from the hills and rice fields where they lived for three years, was a sign 'Baha'i Reading Room, All Welcome." Out of a group of fifty Baha'is twenty failed to return when the conflict subsided. 

 They were either killed or moved to other areas. 

 Mr. Maddela's hair has turned white and he has become stone deaf because of the bombings there. 

 Messengers were sent to as many IBahi'is as possible as telephone facilities were a thing of the past. 

 A meeting was held early the next morning out of doors in front of the Maddela hut with eleven of the friends present  and five non-BaM'is. A short talk was given, and the rest of the four hours at this meeting was spent answering their many questions. 

 These people are sincere and true Baha'is, and one felt their noble and spiritual presence in spite of the destruction and poverty  around them. 

 They are in desperate need of every material assistance possible, and the American, Australian, and New Zealand Baha'is have sent some parcels of food, clothing,  and Baha'i books to these people. 

 I made another trip to Solano a month later and this time was able to instruct them on how to form an Assembly and Community  according to the Administration. I am the first Baha they had met outside of their own community, and our meeting was a joyous one indeed. 

 It was on October 14, 1945 that I sailed from Manila to the States after spending thirty-eight months of trials and tribulations mingled with glorious and uplifting experiences  which Baha'is can experience during such times.

  The partially destroyed lja4ratu'1-Quds of the Baha'is of AbAdili, Persia. Instigated by the Muslimclergy, mobs sacked property and attacked the believers. 

  American soldiers can be obtained from these excerpts selected from Mr. Eichenauer's letters  and reports. 

 "If you could have been here today, you would have felt yourselves carried into the realms of paradise. The Baha'is of Stuttgart and Esslingen gathered at the Baha'i Home on the hill overlooking Esslingen and the verdant Neckar valley "That our Division hovered around in this area had something to do with Divine intervention, not because of myself, but in order that some Baha'i could convey to these friends the greetings from the Baha world without, from which they have been deprived  for about eight years, long, hungry, terror-filled years. We were seated in the lecture hail for lunch, with quotations from 'Ahdu'1-13ah~ hanging from the walls. From there I went to an adjoining room to play the organ. 

 How my heart warmed as the Baha'i children gathered around. It seems almost unbelievable that out of all this destruction, disorder and chaos, the founda tions of that World Civilization of Baha'u'llah  have emerged well-anchored, that the fire and zeal of the believers has remained undimmed, and that their plans for the spreading of the Faith in the coming months will make the Baha'i world sit up and take notice. 

 C(AS the afternoon wore on Baha'is came in droves from Stuttgart and Esslingen, aged and infant, drawn by that irresistible Power of the Cause, that indescribable happiness that pervades every Baha'i meeting. Here are Friedrich and Anna Marie Schweizer, two pillars of the Cause; there is Paul Goilmer, the National Secretary, who risked so much to preserve Baha'i relics; there are his two d9ughters, Lilo and Agnes, who both lost their husbands in the war; not far away is Herr Richter of Leipzig, who was on the Russian front, found his way to Denmark, was finally discharged this month and is now looking for his wife and child from one town to the next You are particularly drawn to the youth, Valtrot

  garde Muller, Peter Rommel and many others. Then somebody asks you, tDid you hear from Mason Rerney?' 
'Did you write Helen Bishop?'

 tDid you bear from my brother, who is a prisoner of war in Colorado  or Missouri or New York?' You say that literature is on the way and only hope that there are plenty of pamphlets in German  for these spiritual beavers to disseminate. If the American believers could only be transported into this environment, realize the hardship and privation that these exemplary  souls have undergone and are still undergoing to a lesser degree, they would rise up as a powerful, spiritual radio and television transmitting station to proclaim with undaunted fervor the Message of the Lord of Hosts. Have you ever been seated in your homes reading your Baha'i books and had fear clutch at your heart because you thought the shuffle of feet outside your apartment  was some Gestapo agent coming to check up on your activities? 

 Did you ever have to bide your pictures of 'Abdu'l-Baha because you didn't want them confiscated or desecrated? 

 How long must our beloved Guardian spend his energy directing appeals to the outstanding American believers who fulfill the Seven Year Plan by the skin of their teeth, who pass up so many opportunities to share the Message with their fellowmen that only by the Grace of God is the Instrument of the Cause left in our bands, who have to be pleaded to on bended knees in order to complete a budget that should be many times as large for the tremendous task we have before us. "As these thoughts race through your mind the 70 some odd believers are gathering  in the garden for a picture; you hope it will have a galvanizing effect on the American community. 

 Now they are gathering again in the lecture hail. Hugo has just read a prayer, and now Paul Goilmer is reading from 

~Sun of Truth,' a Tablet   

 of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The meeting over, Anna Marie Schweizer asks you to her Friday evening study class, Dr. Koller mentions her Monday evening class, you realize the need of getting the youth together, you wish you had more time to give to the Cause. Then, when you feel that you could go on living in this exalted atmosphere forever, you are reminded of the end of the day. 

 You never have felt the warmth that you feel when you shake the hand of each believer and embrace and kiss them and whisper tauf Wiedersehen, AJ1&h-'u'-Abhi.' 

 And so you leave this spot of Paradise and wend your way back to Cannstatt, eager to share your joy with your Baha'i brother (Calvin Wilder), who, as early as May 6, without any address whatsoever, helped you search for the Baha'is in the spiritual heart of Germany." 

  "Baha'i of Wilmette, Calvin

 Wilder and self found 100 Baha'is in the Stuttgart, Ess-lingen,  Goppingen, Geislingen area." (As reported in the November News, John obtained  written authorization for Baha'i meetings  in Stuttgart from Captain Carvel Busey, Religion and Education Officer of the Stuttgart  Military 

Government Detachment.) John

 had two interviews with Captain Busey which proved helpful to the Cause. 
At the second meeting      

Herr Golimer, Chairman     

 of the Stuttgart Assembly, and Dr. Adeiheid Keller, another member, were present. Herr Goilmer had filled out the political questionnaire  which the Military Government requires. 

 This questionnaire when completed reveals one's political history for the past ten years, especially as to whether one had joined the Nazi party. (No one absolutely had to join it.) He was given other forms for the other members of the Stuttgart L.S.A. to fill out. Herr Goilmer showed Captain  Busey copies of correspondence between the N.S.A. of the U.S. and Canada and Himmier concerning suspension of German Baha activities. 

 C~Capt Busey said that each Local Assembly  would have to apply for authorization and that later on the National Assembly could apply for authorization at USFET in Frankfurt. Eventually the American National Assembly can present the case of all the Baha'is in Germany and Austria before the Four Power 

Control Commission in Berlin.

 ~~The shipping date of our division is uncertain. 

 I am trying to get into Mu. Gov't or UNRRA in order to remain in Germany for 6 months or a year and help bring the Baha'is of Europe together."

  From Mara V. Edmonstone, Publicity Chairman of the Miami Baha'i Assembly, October, 1945: tEAs soon as hostilities ended Bruce Davison got busy in Frankfurt, where he was stationed.  He advertised for Baha and received  four answers. 

 Within a week they all met. Among them is Mrs. Horn, who formerly lived in the United States. 

 She was sent to Frankfurt by the Guardian. The Frankfurt Baha'is began holding regular meetings. They are also holding study classes." 

 From John Eichenauer and Bruce Davison, Heddernheim, Frankfurt, Sept. 27, 1945: "We are planning teaching activities for American Zone, publication of literature, radio and press publicity and coordination with Baha'i communities in 

Europe.                    

 "This evening we are observing the Feast with the Frankfurt 

Baha'is."

    REPORT FROM PERSIA         
                           
      1. Persecution             

  (English translations of reports prepared for this volume by the Persian Assembly have been made by Mrs. Marzieh Gail. 

 Mrs. Gail has also adapted the material for publication.) 

 In Persia during recent years the Baha'is have been fair game for anyone. 

 Government orders have been issued against employing them. 

 They have been reviled in Parliament. They have been libeled in the press. 

 They have been blackmailed by venal officials. They have been driven away from their places of business. 
Their shops have been fouled.

 Their homes have been broken into; set fire to; raked of everything till nothing but earth was left. They have been humiliated  in the streets; affronted; threatened; stoned. 

 They have been criminally attacked. They have been killed. 

    The Baha'is of Persia      

 are not prisoners of war in enemy hands. They are not a racial minority. 

 They are Persian citizens, free, law-abiding, of no political party, representing every Persian type. The treatment they are receiving in their homeland is probably without parallel in modern times. It is meted out to them for one reason oniy: their religious belief. 

 All the elements which go to make up a civilized community break down at this point. The Baha'is call the police; but the police themselves are with the rabble; police and criminals together have raped and Looted side by side. So much for the law. 

 As for education, inflammatory books libeling the Baha'is are published by permission of the Ministry of Education and spread throughout the country. But the Baha'is are not allowed to publish anything in Persia.  They cannot bring their case to the public. 
They are gagged.           

 As for the church: the rnuUAs, from their pulpits, whip their congregations into hating the Baha'is: No one can call himself a Mus-urn  who does not kill the Baha'is; kill the Baha'is, and we the mull6s will stand by you. 

 Then comes the orgy of hate and blood. 

 The Baha'is' only recourse is to report occurrences to their National Spiritual 

Assembly.  The Assembly   

 then approaches the National Government authorities: the ShAh himself; the Prime Minister; the members of Parliament; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of the Interior; the 

Ministry of Education;    

 the Chief of Police; the Chief of the Gendarmerie; the security officials. 

 The Assembly  with endless dignity and patience suppiy names, dates, details. 

The national Government    

 authorities are therefore aware at all times of what is going on. The Assembly  then requests the Government to take action. 

 Occasionally some result is achieved — letters are written; a particularly harsh order is rescinded (having made its effect) but the criminals (even the perpetrators of the martyrdoms at SliAhnid) are not brought to trial, they are not punished, the local officials  whose cooperation with the malef actors has made mob rule the order of the clay, are not removed. 

 This is the life of the Persian Baha'is: security of person and property, even the ordinary,  everyday rights of all innocent ctizens in all civilized countries, are not for them. 

 Baha'i pioneers in new areas are favorite targets. 

 The pattern of persecution is generally  the same. 

 An agitator, religious or off-cial,  comes to a town and stirs up the populace.  There is a period of terror. Then a


<p36>
36              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  mob gathers. Baha'i homes or shops are surrounded, maybe wrecked. The police are not to be found, or are with the mob. A Baha'i tries to telegraph for outside help; the telegraph  office refuses to send his message. 

 A neutral bystander catches an assailant, forces him down to Police Headquarters, oniy to see him released. 

 A Baha'i may be beaten until he is maimed for life; if he is killed, his body is mutilated, played with by the mob. 

 The mischief cannot be localized; it spreads from town to town like flames through straw; it reaches a peak during Muslim  religious occasions such as Muliarrarn and Ramad~in; it leaves hidden fires burning for the next conflagration. 

The Baha of Persia     

 today are in constant peril. 

 Government directives against the Baha'is are the most potent sources of the uprisings. A general directive of the Prime Minister is as follows: "Among Baha'i teachers and leaders there are generally to be found Government  functionaries and employees. Theji activities and their interference in local affairs  lead to an evil outcome. Since the national  civil service law strictly prohibits activities and opinions of a political nature in government work, as well as propaganda against th6 official religion of the country or against the national government, and such activity incurs dismissal — it is required that in order to check the propaganda activities of officials and employees of that Ministry, the strongest measures be taken, and in the event of violation the law is to be carried out to its full extent." Baha'i representatives held several meetings with the Prime Minister  regarding this, with the result that the directive was amended to read: "All national officials in accord with general directive  No. 744 are to check any religious demonstrations or propaganda as injurious to law and order. Since information has been received to the effect that a number of seditious  persons have made use of the said directive to show hostility to others, and this has led to public turmoil, pillage and murder,  it is necessary for you to direct that all transgressors be searched out, arrested and heavily penalized." The national Gendarmerie also issued the following statement: "As all officers and men of the Gendarmerie have long been informed a group of seditious perSons are engaged throughout the entire country  in molesting and causing injury to another  group in the name of religion. 

 This has resulted in disorders and lack of security throughout the whole country. To put an end to these occurrences repeated and stringent orders have been issued but contrary to expectation events prove that officials of the Gendarmerie have also, whether openly or secretly, given aid to these seditious perSons and are themselves among the aggressors. All officers and men are hereby informed that the gendarmes are guardians of the rights of the Persian people, and that every individual, whatever his religion, should live at peace under law and justice and with the help of the authorities; and that any person  seeking in the name of religion to wrong another individual should be arrested without delay and given over to the proper authorities. 

 Should the slightest neglect of this directive on the part of officials be witnessed, those responsible will be searched out, dismissed,  and handed Qver to the court." 

 In Abddih, Baha'is were beaten, and their houses sacked and burned. The disorders spread until martial law had to be declared. Later two preachers again aroused the populace, who began working up another storm by publicly cursing the Baha'is. 

 The local Chief of Police did nothing. In Alan gih a Baha'i, 'A1i-Akb~r Khaymih — DCz, was constantly persecuted in various ways. Police did nothing. 

 In Abhar agitators egged on the populace against the Baha'is; in Ardn the entrance  of AIY4 Tilib Babrayni's shop was set on fire; gangs raged through the streets, cursing and defaming the Baha'is and their principles; the K~shin and irAn Assemblies managed to forestall an outbreak. 

 In IJdhdn as RamadAn approached, there was talk among the populace of attacking Baha centers,  preparing witnesses as to apostasy, and putting a Baha'i to death. 

 In Bandar-'Abbds an attack by the S6nnis and others seemed imminent; efforts by the National Baha'i body averted the danger. Following ShkhMd, where the martyrdoms set off a chain-reaction of persecutions throughout Persia, the inhabitants of Bandar-Jaz  began to torment the Baha'is. 

 They broke down the Ijaziratu'I-Quds wall and publicly


<p37>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             37

  cursed the believers. 

 Police did nothing. Then a mob of two hundred persons collected to wipe out the Baha'is. A leading security officer dispersed them. In Bdbul (formerly BArfunish) a critical situation developed when the Baha'i community acquired a new building. The populace was incited verbally and in writing against the 

Baha'is. InBanddak (Yazd   

 area) a miilla ordered his congregation  from the pulpit to drag the Baha'is out of their houses, kilt them and sack their property,  saying that he and his fellow divines would protect whoever obeyed. 

 The few, helpless Baha'is in this area awaited death from moment to moment. 
Hearing of the Shirvdn,    

Gundbdd, and Firdaws       

 uprisings, two Post and Telegraph officials aroused the populace of BushrAyih. 

 They spread word that the Baha'is had been massacred all through Khuni&in and their property confiscated.  The populace fell upon the Baha'is, cursed and beat them, set fire to two shops and seven homes and to the gate of the Baha'i cemetery, stealing a coffin and then tearing down the building in the center of the graveyard;  stoning the houses of other Baha'is; savagely assaulting the women and children. The security officers did nothing beyond attempting  to collect protection money from the victims. 'When the Baha'is tried to wire Maslihad for justice, the head of the Post and Telegraph office refused to transmit the message. 

'Abdu'1-I4usayn Badi'i     

 tried to leave for Mashliad by auto to get help. 

 The head of the Gendarmerie forbade the driver to take him, and threw his belongings out of the car. Other Baha'is sought refuge at the Gendarmerie. 

 The head security officer and the chief of the Post and Telegraph Office promised  to protect them and thus induced them to return home. It later developed that these officials were in collusion with the gangsters  and plotting to hand the Baha'is over to them. That night thirty persons stormed the house of 'Abdu'r-Ras~1 Hi~shangi; the owner and his wife were beaten; doors were broken in, windows smashed, rooms set afire, about 20,000 tum~ns worth of property stolen, and then two persons, one the chief of the Gendarmerie (ra'is — i-pAsgAh), criminally attacked 'Abbas H&hangi's wife. This official and some of the gendarmes then set rugs and bedding on fire. Government officers icers participating in the outrage were: head of the Gendarmerie; three gendarmes; two officials of the Post and Telegraph Office. A chief instigator was the prayer-leader; when two Bab's urged him to check the turmoil, he said, "I and the peopie have waited many years to see this day, and things shall go even worse with you than this." 

 In Band ar-S Nb railroad workers and others were urged to assault the Baha'is and sack their shops. They attacked QuUm-Ijusayn and 'A~'u'11&h Diy~nat and knifed them. A Soviet citizen caught one of the mob and took him to the police, who sent him to Gurg~n, where he was soon released, returning  unpunished to Baha'u'llah. This encouraged  the rabble to storm the shop of Rashidi in broad daylight. Three Baha'is who tried to check them were clubbed and knifed; as a result one, .Aq~y-i-T~'i, is now an invalid. The police did nothing. In Bujn4rd fifteen persons besieged the house of the pioneer Aq&y-i-AkhUqi. The neighbors helped him and the mob dispersed. He had recognized some of them as municipal employees; he therefore appealed to the authorities  against them, but was finally obliged  to sign a release and the case was closed. Unable to remain in BujnArd, he and his f am-ily  left for Maslihad. Then San gsar rose against the Baha'is; in the streets, by day, they heaped insults on the four pioneers, 

(Aqiyan 'Ani'u'llAh Ra~mAniy&n

 'Ali-.Aq& SubbAni, ~asan-Aq&-Yazd~ni and tAl'i-Asghar Uarr), clubbed and stoned them. The following day they fell upon and beat Abmad Sliamsi and tAli DAvar-Parast. 

 For some time thereafter the EaN'is, in mortal danger, could not leave their houses. The police did nothing. Forbidden  to send a telegram, the Baha'is managed  to telephone Maslihad for help, and secretly  dispatched a messenger. The Maslihad Assembly took immediate action, and local authorities there issued stringent orders to Bujn4rd, orders supposedly to be executed by the very persons responsible for the out.-rage.  Later, there was mounting terror at Bujniird. The populace was comptetely out of control. Symptoms of an epidemic of fanatical hate began to spread through Khur~s~n.

  in search of a Baha'i victim, ignored the Chief of Police who was trying to check them, and shouted him down. 

 Authorities finally got the town under control. 

 Burujin reports that the Baha'is of Bavir-Ahrnadi were fined eight thousand tAm &ns on the grounds of their being Baha'is and they were obliged to pay him that sum for their own protection. 

In Ua4rat-i-'Abdu'1-'Azim  

 relatives  of the Baha'i Uasan-Aqi tried to make him recant. Failing, they aroused the populace  against the Baha'is. A mob attacked the house of Dr. ShafA'i. 

In Khurram-Abdd (S±ah-Sav~r)

 the Baha'is were abused on the streets. In Khurram-Abdd (Lurist~n) efforts of the Assembly averted a crisis. 

 In i{~uvaydak (Yazd) four Baha'i pioneer families had formed an Assembly. 

 A dervish came to the village and aroused the populace. Authorities were appealed to and checked him, but they made every effort to collect blackmail from the Baha'is. 

 At three o'clock one morning, a mob from a nearby town came to Darzi-Kuld to attack the Baha'is. The believers had been warned beforehand; they met, chanted prayers, and formed a plan to protect themselves; when the agitators arrived, three Baha'is went out to meet them; the leader of the mob said, "We have come to punish you because you do not keep the RamadAn fast"; they answered  him gently, saying that in matters of conscience all should be free. They spoke so well that the agitators asked their pardon and returned to their own village, Kiichik-Saniy-i-ShThi. 

 In Rafsanjdn an old, helpless Baha'i, MuIIA 'Au, was severely beaten. Government officers  such as the Director of the Court of Documents, his subordinates and colleagues, Director of the local Court, and Director of the Registry of Documents, and the Rawdili-Kbin  (preacher on the persecutions of the holy Jm~ms) and his fellow, continually stirred up the populace. Sudden and horrible bloodshed was imminent. In Karbndbjd noted Baha'is were humiliated and beaten by the landowner, QAsim-i-SAIihi. In Ridd — Abdd the manager of the villages incited laborers and land agents to attack and beat Nu~ratu'-11Th  Diy&'i; then they forced him to walk at the head of a mob all the way to RafsanI~n. The residents of RAdsar attacked the pio neers, refused to rent them houses and shops and tried to drive them out. 

 'Abdu'1-Husayn Dargb~m, a leading Baha'i of Zanjdn was warned by the Chief of Police to leave town because of a possible uprising. 

 Obliged to absent himself from his business for two weeks, he suffered considerable financial loss. The martyrdoms at ShdhrAd began in the same way: local authorities, instead of curbing  the mischief while there was time, demanded  that leading Baha'is get out of town; seeing this, the populace was encouraged to every excess. 

 The rabble of Zdbul publicly insulted the Baha'is, saying, "You have been driven out of other towns and we shall do the same." The Baha'is as usual bore this with patience. 

 One night the Muslims fouled the doors of all Baha'i shops; then, screaming and yelling, they tried to get into the house of 'Izzatu'llAh Ishrati but a neighbor saved him. Two nights later they set fire to Jshrati's house; everything he and his family had was destroyed, even his clothing; his loss totaled fifteen thousand tAm&ns. In San gsar, the mujtahid told his congregation not to trade or intermarry with Baha'is. The Chief of Police collaborated with the agitators here. Baha'is were publicly stopped in the streets of Sdri and threatened with property losses and death and "the fate of the Baha'is of Shihriid." A mijila said from his pulpit, ~'Every Muslim who kills less than a hundred Baha is not a true Muslim." 

In Siydhgil (DilmTh) a     

 scurrilous, anonymous letter against the Baha'is was circulated through the mails. In Sir Pin (KirmAn area) a mob beat five Baha'is: 

Nu~ratu'1Uh VAthiqi, Dhabihu'llAh

 SultAni, QuUm-'AIi N&~ni, 'Abdu'1-VahhTh Nit r~ni, and Qulamu'il&h Mawhibati. 
Two are now bedridden.     

 The whole town was in turmoil;  the residents closed their shops and besieged  Police Headquarters and the Telegraph Office. 

 In the presence of the attackers, the Head of the Department of Justice upbraided the Baha'i victims and threatened to expel them, 

The Police Department      

 doctor refused  to treat the injured Baha'is. The Tabriz Spiritual Assembly was able to have priest-instigated uprisings quelled in SN-shvdn and 'Ajabsloir. The 1sf ThAn Assembly did likewise when there was a similarly inspired  outbreak in Shah-KiLl. 
In Shdhi at

  the dedication of a mosque, the inull4s from their pulpits urged on the congregation to kill the Baha'is and carry off their property. Inhabitants of several neighboring villages were uniting to make an attack on the Baha'is of Sdri: Notices were posted throughout Dizaj near ShAhiad, stating that some ttBah~'i dogs" had been killed in Sh4hMd, their families arrested, and their possessions set on fire, and that nothing was left in their houses but earth, since even the building bricks had been carried away; and that the "dogs of unbelievers" listed in the notice, should be driven from Dizaj at once, or the inhabitants of 5liAhriid would come and kill them and a number of Muslims would be trampled in the confusion. This was signed: The inhabitants of ShThriid. 

 The Baha'is listed were: ttRi~U Birjandi and his sons; ShAh-MbA and Arnru'lhh; 

Hasan-UstAd Ibr~him; Bini~ 

 Sutr~ Layli with her son 'Abbas; B4n6 Kislivar; 'Au-Muhammad and the rest." 
The notices were typed.    

 The oniy typewriters in that area are in Government offices; local officials must therefore have assisted the malefactors. 

 The attack on the Baha'is made in Parliament,  purposely vague and insinuating, accused  the American advisors of protecting special interests and giving positions to Baha'is; it condemned Dr. Arthur C. Mill-spaugh,  administrator general of Persia's finances, as partial and apparently political, and spoke of the Baha'is as a divisive factor, secretly  attacking IslAm and engaging in politics  and furthering the aims of imperialism. The National Assembly's answer was sent to the Head of the Parliament and to every deputy; the text of this answer is given below. 

 The Azddigdn newspaper viciously at-tackcd  thc Baha'is, calling them a ~corrupt faith" and "fit to have their blood shed" and otherwise defaming and libeling us. It stated that the law excluded 

Baha'is from Government    

 positions. The National Assembly  vigorously protested to the Prime Minister regarding this public misrepresentation  of a large section of the population, referring to the long persecution, the many inflammatory articles in a controlled press, the barbarity at Sh&hn~d and elsewhere, the official indulgence which made these things possible. The burning by Government officers of Baha'i books at the frontiers was contrasted with the authorized circulation of such attacks on the Faith as ttBah4'i Pretensions" by Al mad Kasravi, the 

"Political Confessions     

 of Prince Dolgorouki" and the Azddigdn article. 

The National Spiritual     

 Assembly  asked that, if such publications were permitted, the Baha'is might also be accorded the freedom of the press, in order to refute their defamers. 

 Two Baha'is of Tabas were threatened, persecuted and stoned, until they had to take their families and leave the town. In the Fashandak area, Baha'is are deprived of all security. 

 In 'Irdq, a circular was dispatched to all Government bureaus, protesting the employment of Baha'is and calling for their dismissal pursuant to article 2 of the civil service law, and citing other cases of Baha'i dismissals as listed in the newspaper Iqddm (No. 607). An outbreak was quelled in FirilzkAh. 

 Firdaws residents, stirred up by agitators from Gurnib&d, burned the entrances of Baha'i homes, broke into one and beat the owner. Constantly threatened with death, the Baha'is gathered together outside of town with a number of gendarmes to guard them. 

 Mashhad authorities arrested some of the agitators; this angered the rest. Letters were posted on the walls at night, telling the populace to kill the Baha'is. Local authorities, including Qudsi-Niy~, Commander  of the Gendarmerie, whitewashed the risings in Fdrdn. In Fasd, Baha'is are continually subjected to abuse. In Qurvih-Kurdistdn, a circular directive from the Prime Minister removed the much-persecuted youth, Mas'iad Radavi, from the post of primary school teacher. Teachers in Sir JAn who attended Baha'i meetings were ordered to be suspended. In Qasr-i-Shirin, the representative  of the Ministry of Education in —  cited the populace until they fell on the Baha'is, stoned and defamed them. 

 A policeman  who was present did nothing. Police Headquarters finally summoned the Baha'is and drove them out of town. In Qum they broke into the house of Dr. S&bir, wrote obscenities on the walls, fouled the rooms, stole furniture and silver. The police did nothing. In the Abarqii quarter notices were written on the walls, warning the populace not to

  sell to the Baha'is nor allow thena the use of the public baths. Even the bakers refused them bread. In Kuldh-Darrih (near Qazvin) the rabble who prepared to march on the Baha'is were armed with swords, daggers, sickles and shovels, and led by men beating drums and cymbals. in Kafshgar-Kuld a butcher and a farmer tried to kill the Baha'i Siyyid IbrThim Laq&i, but he was saved by a shepherd. 

 The nbtorious fanatics of KdshaSn attacked the Baha'is at will. One night they burned the entrance ways to Baha'i homes~ The police did nothing. A threatening letter was posted by night on the house door of Khalilu'11Th Tal&'i, a Baha'i of Kangdvdr. IA 

Kirindn a society, CCThe   

 Religious Society of I(irm&h" was formed, which is a center for agitation against the Baha'is. 

In Gui-pdygdn  the Chief   

 of Police did what he could to check the turmoil when two Baha'i homes were set on fire. h Our gdit the rabble  prey freely on the Baha'is. 

 In Gundbdd (Khuris&n area) the Baha'is were driven out and all their possessions confiscated. They were beaten. Two went insane and a third broke down. 

 Refugees reached Mashhad where the Iocd Baha'i Assembly made strong representations to the authorities; as a re-suit,  22 residents of Gun~b&d were questioned, 6 arrested, and a meeting was held at which the leading officials there were ordered  to maintain the peace. Security was partially reestablished, but many of the believers  suffered irreparable ioss. In Mahmzid-Abdd,  MAzindar6n, the rabble dug up the grave of a Baha'i, broke open the coffin and scattered the body. In FiraydAn-Kindr they repeatedly fouled the door of a Baha'is shop. In Miydn-Ducib seven Baha'is were beaten in the streets by a gang. 

 The rabble roam at will, attacking the Baha'is; the authorities issued an order to expel the believers. In A'fahmAddbdd (Yazd) a Baha'i house was set on fire. In Mahallit (KAsMn) the 'ulam~ were active against the Baha'is. 

 In Mu4ain-mad-Abdd,  landlords, under pressure, took back the houses they had rented to Baha'i pioneers. Some of the latter had to leave town. Seven armed persons attempted to attack  and kill the family of Valiyu'11Th in Mihriz; they broke in and stole 10,000 ti~m~ns worth of property. Police and gendarmes  arrested them; the Baha'is were in a state of terror. Ghaff~r 

JalAli, prominent Baha'i   

 of Miydnaj, was a constant target. Muhammad-'Ali Fur4ghi's house was set fire to in Nardq. Leaflets were dropped from minarets and roofs into a crowd of pilgrims at the shrine of Su1t~n-'A1i, urging them to arise against Fur4giai. In Nd'in, Baha'is were defamed and stoned, and their houses set on fire. 

 There was a fanatical outbreak in Nis/odhAr (burial place of 'Umar Khayyam).  When trouble started in Nayriz, the Commander of the Gendarmerie force of Jahrum assisted the Baha'is, writing to them as follows: C~To the respected Spiritual Assembly  of the Baha'is of Nayriz: Pursuant to your letter No. 168 to check public wrongdoing and the disregard of personal rights, and your appeal that order be preserved  in that area: 'We have written Fdtih Nayrizi, Chief of Police there, and also the Head of the Gendarmerie, and issued the necessary orders. 

 (signed) Commander of Force No. 17." 

 A religious procession in Nayriz surrounded the houses of Baha'is; the mob, with foul language and obscene behavior, attempted  aggression; the Baha as usual did not retaliate. Children and youth are constantly affronted in the streets here. One night the rabble fired shots into the bedroom where the children of 'All Asgliar Man~iiri were asleep; mercifully, they were spared. The police did nothing. At Nalddvand school teachers in their classrooms urged their students to rise against Baha children in the school, A teacher, Muj ihid, taught that Baha were atheists and ritually unclean. The Baha'i doctor Shaf&'i was forbidden use of the public bath; two Baha'is were beaten; Dr. Tavakkul was affronted by a gang led by the son of the leading security officer. The Chief of Police in Hamaddn constantly opposes the Baha'is, summoning leading Baha'i business men to Headquarters for questioning. 

 One night a gang near Mihdiy-Abdd  blasphemed the Faith and beat a Baha'i, 'At4'u'11Th N&iyyih, with chains and their fists, and kicked him. 
A Baha'i woman saved him.  

In Hurntuzak (near Yazd)   

 a six-year-old child of a Baha'i family, who was feebleminded, fell into a well and died. 

 The security officers arrested Mul2am-mad-Ja'far

  and held them in prison thirtyfive days on the false charge that they had killed the child. 

In Yazd Shahriy&r KhAvari  

 was dismissed  from the office of grain distribution for being a Baha'i. 

 The foregoing shows that efforts have been made to wipe out the Baha'is of Persia. It should be remembered in this connection that the Baha'is are Persia's largest non-Muslim  community; that far from being enemies of their country they have spread its fame around the globe, as a Holy Land, the birthplace of Baha'u'llah. That far from being enemies of Islim, they have taught IslAm wherever their own Faith is taught, thereby braving unpopularity in Christian lands. That they are bearing an intolerable situation without retaliation, confident  in the Guardian's message to the be-frayed of SliAhriid (sent with his gift of one thousand pounds to the needy amongst them), that the transgressors without exception  would be called to account, and that one day the star of happiness would shine for the Baha'is of Persia — for God "stand-eth  on a watch tower." 
                           
  MARTYRDOMS AT SHAHR6D      

  The 15th of Sha'b4n is celebrated by the Shi'ahs as the birthday of the Q4'im. Beginning  with the first of this month 

(July 22, 1944) the Muslims

 of ShAhriid directed their activities against the local Baha community. 

 They held nightly meetings in mosques, homes, and takiyyihs to decide on the persecutions they would inflict. In the streets and b4zArs of the city, they began openly to curse the Faith. 

 On the evening of July 25th a mob set fire to the gate of the Haziratu'1-Quds and carried off some of the furniture. On the 2 8th, by night, a great crowd suddenly attacked the house of a believer, intent on killing him and sacking his property, but they dispersed with no damage done. 

    On Tuesday August 8th      

 at eight in the morning, a terrible clamor broke out in the town. The storekeepers and the people from the b&z&rs closed their shops and joined the mob, which swelled to no less than five thousand persons. 

 They were armed with clubs, stones, knives, daggers, butcher's cleavers. 

 Some of the friends took refuge at the Police Station, thinking they would be protected.  But a police sergeant said, "These are unbelievers — they ought to be destroyed!" At this a policeman rushed on them and beat them with the butt of his rifle. 

 Meanwhile the mob flung itself at the homes and shops of the Baha'is, carrying off what they could, and making bonfires of the rest, both in the buildings and out on the streets. Then they came upon Aq&y-i-Muhammad-i-JadhlAni, and they surrounded him and beat him with their clubs. A wellintentioned person momentarily saved him, and begged him to run away. He refused and was caught again and this time they fell on him with cleavers and knives. 

 He fainted and two persons carried him to the office of a doctor who lived nearby on the second floor of a building. The doctor set about treating his wounds; at that moment a part of the mob, on their way back from ransacking the shop of Aq~y-i-~hucU'i, heard what had happened. 

 They stormed the doctor's office, flung him and the wounded man down to the street, and fell on Aq4y-i-Jadhb4ni with daggers and knives, slashing at his head and body until they thought him dead, and then stoning him till he was hidden to his knees in stones. 

 Those who had sacked and set fire to the shop of Aq4-i-KhudA'i now turned to the store of Aq4zAdih, looted his property, poured kerosene on the building and set it~ aflame. They passed on to the stores of MuhAjir-Z4dih, Tab4-TabA'i and Athari, pillaged and burnt their merchandise, and then directed themselves against the homes of AqAy-i-N&diri and his neighbor RuhMni. They were shouting "Y~ Ijusayn!" 

 and tty4 SAhibu'z-Zam&n!", and they started to break in the door of N4diri's house. With his family, he was able to reach the roof and cross over to the house of Aq4 — i-Ruhb6ni. The mob went through the rooms, looking for the occupants; they carried off whatever they could and burned the rest, even to the window frames and the doors. Then they forced their way into Aq~y-i-Ruhb4ni's house, searched out the men, found none, assaulted the women, plundered the house and went on to sack the home of Aq&y-i-Tiby~ni.


<p42>
42              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  That part of the mob which had first attacked  Aq&y-i-JadhbAni, followed the first mob to the home of AqAy-i-N~diri. 

 Here they assaulted the wife of Aq4-i-Diljii'i and threatened to kill her, drawing a dagger point across her throat. Then one of them caught sight of Aq4-i-N~idiri, and struck with a dagger at his skull, cutting it open. The others, unmoved by the cries of the ter-rifled women and children, closed in with their knives and cleavers, and killed him. 

 That afternoon a non-Bah~'i managed with great difficulty to enter the house. He found the martyr lying ~with his hands folded, his face and body drenched in blood; the eyes were partly open and looking upward;  of the skull, only the forehead was left; the spinal column was torn away, and oniy the shoulders still in place. 

 Later, the police were notified that a man was lying unconscious on Mirza Street, and they sent out four men to carry him to a hospital. 

They laid Aq4-i-Jadhb~ni   

 on a stretcher, taking him past the Police Station. It was reported that they dropped their burden several times as they went, to make sure that no life was left in the mutilated body. Before the municipal doctor could see him, he had passed away. 

    Leaving AqAy-i-N~diri's    

 home, the mob next attacked the home of AqAy-i-MuMjir. Here they laid hold of a brave young Baha'i, HidAyatu'llAh A'~amiy~n, and assaulted him with daggers, spades and axes, striking at him till he fell unconscious. 

 Then, thinking him dead, they stoned him and went their way. He lived, however; he was brought to Tihdn for treatment, and his condition is improving. 

 The mob had thoroughly sacked and looted the homes of Aq4-i-Tiby6ni, Aq~zAdih, Muhammad-i-Ja~b~ni, and Khud4'i, even burning the doors and windows. 

 Now they stormedthe house of Ijasan-i-MuMjir. Some of them began to loot the place and others climbed up to the flat roof terrace and here, with clubs, daggers and cleavers, they killed Muhijir. Then they tied his feet together with a rope and threw his body down to the courtyard. 

 Over and over, they raised his body to the roof and threw it down. And then their bloodlust eased and after destroying whit they could of the house, they left. 

    The National Spiritual     

 Assembly had repeatedly warned the Persian Government, both in writing and in the course of official visits, of the situation. Some days prior to the martyrdom; they had once again protested the issuance by the Prime Minister of a circular of instructions containing statements  contrary to the facts and intended to bar the Baha'is from employment throughout the country. Their communication had stated that the enemies of the Faith throughout Persia, encouraged by the Prime Mm —  ister's instructions, would undoubtedly arise against the believers and perpetrate acts which would dishonor Persia in the eyes of the world. The Assembly had reminded the Prime Minister of the guiltlessness of the Baha'is and their good citizenship, urged him to rescind the order, and closed by saying that not even in the days of the tyrant Nisiri'd-Din Sh4h had such a decree against the Baha'is been issued. 

 No result was obtained from our representations. 

 The local officials themselves assisted  in the perpetration of these crimes. 

 Following the martyrdoms, the Guardian directed that the strongest representations be made afresh to the ShTh, the Prime Minister,  the Parliament, and the Ministries of Justice and of the Interior. As a resdrlt, the adverse circular referred to above was officially rescinded by the issuance of another order, and officials were detailed from the capital to conduct an investigation in ShAh —  rdd. 

 Considerable effort was required to forestall the enemies of the Faith there, who did all they could to misrepresent the facts in the case; the true situation however, has at last been clarified, with the result that a notorious gangster and some of his accomplices have been arrested, and it is hoped that the other ringleaders will also be brought to justice. 

 As to public opinion concerning the martyrdoms: the educated classes and nd-tables expressed disgust at the outrage and sympathy for its vi;tims. Except for the ecclesiastical order, very few persons of any class level approved of what had taken place. The press reported these events in detail, expressed horror, and laid the blame on the intrigues of the clergy. Very few newspapers held the Baha'is responsible. In Parliament

  reference was made to the occurrences and a vote of censure taken. His Majesty was understood, in the course of a recent address, to allude to the case with reproach. 

 The names and professions of these three martyrs were: Mu1~ammad-i-JadhbAni, merchant  and pioneer from Sangsar; I:Iasan-i--MuMjir-ZAdih, a merchant, resident of 

SM-hr~d,  and Asadu'llAh   

 N~diri, a government functionary from Tihr&n. Solemn memorial services were held for them throughout Persia. 

 A message from the beloved Guardian, regarding another martyrdom and received after the martyrdoms at Shfthriid, follows: ~'In speaking of the martyrdom of JinAb-i-QuLAm-~usayn-i-Ri4v~n in Qahfaraj he expressed the greatest sorrow and pity and he wrote to us: The moving account was read. For that wronged and martyred one, that trusted and most obedient servant of the beauteous, self-subsistent Lord, I ask forgiveness and the exalting of his station, from the depths of my heart. Let them console the family on my behalf, and let Aq&y-i-VarquA send them 1,000 frim~ns from the Huq6q funds. Assure them that these calamities, and these hostilities and transgressions  of the evil doers and the inimical, will all, according to the unfailing divine promises,  vanish away, and the sun of glory and joy and power will shine from the horizon of that land. 

 The tyrannical will be afflicted with the direst of torments, and that op.-pressed  community will wax powerful and gain the victory. Be assured. Be patient." 
                           
2.  The National Spiritual 
Assembly Sends Letter to   

Members of Persian Parliament To
the revered national       

Parliament of Persia:      

  As the honored members are aware, on the 16th of DaymAh of the current year the honorable member AqAy-i-LankirAni in the course of a speech made reference to the Baha'is, and most regrettably directed against them defamatory and false accusations. 

 Although in the opinion of this Assembly,  your honored selves and the speaker well knew that these statements were made only for political purposes, to incite feeling against the Baha'is, and that doubtless the honored speaker did not himself believe what he was saying — as the Qur'an tells us, "They said with their lips what was not in their hearts" — nevertheless this Assembly deems it necessary, in order to set forth the true facts in the case, to make the following representations to the revered national 

Parliament:               

 From the very inception of the Baha'i Cause, those who found the progress of this religion detrimental to their own personal aims and material pursuits, arose with all their strength to destroy the followers of His Holiness Baha'u'llah. 

 With all their energies arousing the populace and its leaders against them, they urged them on to kill the Baha'is and pillage their property, until finally they shed the blood of over 20,000 followers of this Cause, old and young, men and women, not even sparing infants at the breast. And it was as the poet has written: ttTh is not the point of a thorn but it drips a martyr's blood." 

 In addition to slaughtering the Baha'is and carrying off their property, the adversaries  of this Faith did not cease from defaming and calumniating them, and from their pulpits and in their books they called the innocent Baha'is now spreaders of atheism and heresy, now partisans of despotism and absolute monarchy, again revolutionaries and anarchists, again the tool of foreign political interests; and yet again they claimed that the very existence of these servants of God was contrary to the good of the nation; or that they had no patriotism; or again they circulated spurious writings such as the CcPolitical Confessions of KinAz Dolgorouki," falsely attributing these to our northern neighbors; and again ascribing the existence of this community to the political requirements of our neighbor to the south. In brief, they have continually held this guiltless peo-pie  up before the public gaze, representing them in one form or another as the enemies of society, with the result that most of the population think it pleasing to God that they should either shun the Baha'is or heap persecutions on them. 

 But the Baha'is, who acknowledge His Holiness Baha'u'llah, on the testimony of all Sacred Scripture, as the Promised One of all ages and the Establisher of the oneness


<p44>

  of humanity — and regard His teachings as the cause of brotherhood and peace and concord  among all nations and peoples, and as the one remedy for the world's ills, and consider  the Sacred Tree as belonging neither to East nor 'West — feel this heavenly power to be beyond the imputations and threats and alarms of men; and with complete patience and forbearance, trusting in God and clinging  to His grace, they have borne the heavy load of calumny that a hostile people have imposed on them. Under fire and sword and chains, on the rack, at the point of the spear, they have not flinched. With utter meekness, they have continued to teach the people and set forth the laws of God. 

 And so the fame of this Cause has spread around the world, and Babui'i communities have been organized in 78 countries of the globe, and the literature of this Faith has been translated into more than 45 languages, even published in Braille, and two great Houses of Worship have been raised in Turkist~n and the United States — so that men of perception acknowledge that the Baha'i Faith is above the allegations of its enemies, and sanctified from their unseemly charges. 

 For it is a divine Faith, a divinely-revealed  Law, heralded by all the Sacred Scriptures; and in the end mankind will, gathered beneath the teachings of the Life-Giver  of men, withdraw their hands from aggression and become as one people, f or-getting  old hostilities, extinguishing old fanaticisms and hates. Intelligent observers are aware that in spite of every calamity and persecution, today the followers of many different religions — Buddhist, Brahrnan, Zoroastrian,  Jewish, Christian, Muslim and many denominations — have come together in this Faith and live as brothers. 

 This is the mystery concealed in the holy Qur'Thic verse: ttHadst thou spent all the riches of the earth, thou couldst not have united their hearts, but God had-i united them It is indeed regrettable at a time when a great number of progressive nationalities and groups have become members of the Baha'i Faith, whose Founder was a Persian, and in acknowledging His Holiness Baha'u'llah have affirmed their belief in all the Prophets of the past, and consider Persia as their Qiblit and point of adoration, and long some day to visit the homeland of the sacred Founder, and even to be buried in Persian earth — that the Persians themselves, compatriots of Baha'u'llah's, still after all these years cannot refrain from hostile acts, and consider this perspicuous Faith as some worldly scheme, and judge of the Baha'is — who have freely given up their property and their very lives to teach the people, exalt the Persians, and promote the happiness of men — in such a fashion. 

 For more than a hundred years, the Baha'is have been made the target of every sort of calumny and falsehood, and each man in his own way has attacked this guiltless people, and held them up to ridicule, or spread defamatory  and libellous writings against them. 

 And yet the Baha'is have not stooped to answer their persecutors, and have left them to God and to the judgment of the wise. Now, however, that such statements have been made in an official place, the nation's  Parliament, they feel obliged to break their silence and offer this communication to that honored body. 

 In view of the fact that AqAy-i-Lankir-Lni's  purpose was avowedly to affirm that the Baha'is were taking part in political affairs and working against the welfare of the nation, this Assembly herewith presents in brief the Baha'i views regarding total abstention from politics, as well as their utter devotion to Persia — homeland of the sacred Founder of their Faith — whose earth is soaked with the blood of thousands of their martyrs. It will thus become clear that the Baha'is are entirely innocent of the charges. 

 They oppose  no government or people, nor do they interfere in the political affairs of any nation;  to them, all are sustained by the grace of the one God, all are His children and servants. Their utmost desire is to serve this land, their greatest joy is to work for the education and enlightenment and spiritual guidance of their fellow Persians. 

 His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha, referring to noninterference in political matters, says: c(The community of God do not enter into politics, and they are not concerned with the governments of the world. We are apart from all communities, and with weeping eyes invoke God's grace and bounty on all peoples. 

 • We are commanded to obey the Govern

  ment, we shun all enmity and discord. The friends must bring about world unity, they must promote, with the breaths of the All-Merciful,  the oneness of all people. We have for partisan groups neither love nor enmity, for to the beloved of God these local strifes, political or religious, are of no import.  We are the well-wishers of all, we know norning of illusory ideas. We endeavor to lay the foundations of unity, we abolish hatred among religions and peoples. 

 We seek universal peace, we desire truth and friend ship and reconciliation among all kindreds and communities. 

 This is the purpose of the Baha'is; this is the way of the spiritual. 

 Explain your nonpartisanship and make clear the fact that you are the well-wishers of all men; and spread the 

Cause of God."             

 His Holiness Shoghi Rabbani, the Guardian  of the Baha'i Cause, says: "From political affairs and the hostilities of parties and governments, all must both inwardly and outwardly,  in speech and in our hearts, completely abstain, keeping ourselves entirely free from every thought of this kind. 

 With no party should we seek political relationships, with none of these varied and conflicting  groups should we affiliate. What connection has the Cause of God with political  affairs, what concern with the enmities and discords, whether national or foreign, of nations and peoples? We must, with all dignity and wisdom, ardor and energy, steadfastness and patience, read continually and scrupulously obey, the loving counseis of the beloved Lord. With spiritual instrumentalities, we must improve the character of men, and not hold fast to political and worldly methods. With heavenly powers we must gradually change and subdue the hearts and look to the purifying of minds and souls — not seek after the promotion of our own name and fame, or think of winning a rank and station in this transifory world. We must express in heart and speech our complete  nonpartisanship where political parties are concerned, and with word and deed demonstrate that we are the well-wishers of all humanity, whether governments or peoples    for this is a fundamental 

Baha'i                     

 principle.     At this time the most important matter, and that which will insure the protection and happiness of the friends, is none other than complete nonintervention in po-utica1  affairs and partisan groups, whether national or foreign. Regarding this, on many occasions Baha'u'llah and the Master revealed clear and emphatic teachings, and absolute instructions are set forth in the Baha'i writings.  Any attempt at interpretation of these would be as a mortal poison to the body of the Cause of God, would cast it into many an abyss, sully its pure raiment, completely shut off the spirit of confirmation, greatly afflict the friends, and deprive them of all the bounties of God." 

 His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha, concerning the future glory of Persia, says: "That ancient land will become the focus of shining grace, and the fame of her might will reach unto the East and the West. And she will be the center for the blessings of the All-Merciful, and the dawning-point of the graces of God. The ancient gloiy will return to her, and the closed doors will be flung wide, for the divine  Luminary hath shone in her heaven and the Light of Truth hath raised Its banner above her. The song of the upper world hath sounded and the shining of the Supreme Concourse bath gone forth; the kingdom of God hath raised its tabernacle, the divine laws have been spread abroad. 

 Ere long thou wilt find that land fragrant with the breaths of holiness, that region glowing with the light of yore. Therefore must the Persians treasure this blessing, and praise the Lord of all creation that He hath vouchsafed to them such bounty and granted such adornment and repose. He bath made the old homeland to be the noblest of nations, and the ancient shelter to be the dayspring of the manifest Light. It is fitting that this bounty be cherished, and the Creator be lauded. 

   ~ Thou pure Lord! From     

 the beginning Thou didst perfume the earth of IrAn with musk, Thou didst make her heart-stirring and full of wisdom and glittering with jewels. From her east, Thy sun did ever scatter light, from her west the moon did glimmer. Her land induceth iove, her heavenly plains are thick with herbs and flowers, her hillsides crowded with rich fruits, her meadows the envy of heaven's gardens; her mind born of the angels, her ardor a clamoring, floorless sea.

  A group of Baha'i students from Persia who have come to America to continue their studies. 

  "You will witness how by the confirmations of God, Persia shall burst forth, and her life-giving flood shall make the whole earth fresh and verdant. Those regions are the home of the blessed Tree, the land of the Desired  One, and in the end they shall flourish in such wise that all the countries of the globe shall emulate her. Today, although the land of light is as a buried city, ere long it shall be as a house built up, and its everlasting glory shall shine forth. 

 It shall be a point of pilgrimage for all the world, and the chief nation of the globe, and the people of light shall glory amidst all peoples. 

 The future of Persia is all majesty and might. 

 All the nations of the world shall look toward Persia with reverent regard; be ye assured, her advancement shall be such as to dazzle the minds of all the wise and great. This is the  greatest glad-tidings; tell it to whomsoever thou wilt. This is a promise that shall not fail. 

 "You who are the well-wishers of the State, and true and obedient to the Government, , and harmonious, be ye occupied in service, and those amongst you who are employed  by the Government, conduct yourselves with the utmost rectitude and truth, purity and detachment and Iustice." 

 There are many such teachings, requiring abstention from all political activity, and also prophesying the future glory of Persia. For the sake of brevity, we have contented ourselves with these few excerpts. 

 I have the honor to remain, Most respectfully yours, The Secretary of the National Spiritual  Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia (Signed)

    3. Baha'i Activity        

 Parallel with their sufferings the Baha'is of Persia are steadily growing. 

 In the first year of the new century, 23 persons spent their entire time as traveling teachers (one of these was a woman, Ishr6qiyyih Dhabib, who went to 'Iraq). About 140 others pioneered. 

 Although the persecutions fright

  ened seekers away from meetings, whenever there was relative quiet intensely interested persons would attend. Youth went to advanced  teacher's classes under Baha'i scholars, and then set out on trips. 

 Although a long waiting period is required of them, hundreds of new 

Baha'is enrolled. In      

 Tihr~n there were as many as 76 teaching meetings a week. Receptions were arranged to acquaint new with old believers. Pioneering has been the order of the day, although the economic  situation, primitive conditions, and unbearable local fanaticism obliged some pioneers to leave their posts. The National Spiritual Assembly is doing all it can to insure a steady pioneer effort — making a study of new areas, evaluating past experiences,  and assisting settlers until they find positions. The Travel Committee drew up a 3 '/2 Year Plan to coordinate activities; meetings primarily for youth and the most noted older Baha'is were held in TihrAn to encourage settlement elsewhere and resulted in many volunteers. 

 Itinerants served as a liaison between communities. 

 Receptions honoring returned pioneers were held; their labors were praised and their recommendations  studied. 

 Two Z~ihidTh families were able to settle in British BakchistAn. Dr. MisMh and his family were not able to remain  in Afgh~nisdn. 

 Muhammad-Husayn T4m and family settled briefly in that country,  having obtained visitors' visas, but the Afgb~n government did not renew these. Persian believers have, however, been able to maintain residence in other neighboring countries. 

 Miscellaneous activities of Persian Baha'is show the recent picture there: Development of the institution of the 19-Day  Feast on a uniform national basis modeled  after the procedure which the Guardian has established is a primary concern of the National Baha'i bodyK A newsletter is provided  free at Feasts and sold elsewhere, to deepen the knowledge of the friends. It has proved most popular; one result has been the spontaneous forming of literacy classes among older persons. The Feasts are held in several places on a given date and to each is sent a spokesman who talks on the news of the Faith. Tilirin has a list of 110 such speakers. 

 Management of the Feasts involves much committee work and constant meetings.  At present consultation is provided for by having written suggestions sent in; these are transmitted to the local Baha'i body, which answers each in writing. 

 One committee provides food, clothing, fuel and other necessaries for the needy; another  arranges for their medical care. 
                          
4. Historic Baha'i Shrines

  The house in which Baha'u'llah was born is now completely restored. Period objects to furnish it were searched out by 'Abbas iman. The work, still in progress, had so far cost twenty thousand ti5mAns. A like sum was collected from the believers to repair the Baha'i cemetery at Ab6xlih, destroyed by a mob; 'Au Aq~ Quds Jiiribchi contributed the iron gate. 

 Baha'i sacred and historic sites have long been sought out and purchased. The necessary research takes considerable time. Sites not yet determined are: the sacred house in Tihr&n where 'Abdu'l-Baha was born; the house in SiyTh-Duhun near Qazvin where the Mb resided briefly. A register of all Baha'i sites with descriptions and photographs is being prepared, and this will safeguard them in their original form through all time. With the help of the SliThi LSA, important repairs were made at $liaykh Tabarsi; other holy sites were also kept in repair, thousands of him~ins being expended. It is not always possible to purchase  these sites; many belong to nonBahA'is who are not anxious to seii. 

 The Committee in charge is constantly on the alert for opportunities to acquire them permanently. Where possible Baha'is live in them as tenants,  keeping them safe and in repair. 

 At the Guardian's direction, the N.S.A. contributed 700 pounds to the Baha'is of Beirut toward purchase of their cemetery. Erection of the tombs of the King of Martyrs  and the Beloved of Martyrs was begun. Much of the interior decoration of the Ti-hdn  Ija~iratu'1-Quds and almost all wiring and installation of tubing was completed; the large building has indirect lighting and is provided with a stage; a great lamp hangs from the center of the dome. The garden, landscaped, has tree-lined avenues, a pool, a travelers' house and meeting hail, living quarters for a chauffeur, a garage.

 are being collected; relics and writings of the B~b, Baha'u'llah, the Master and the Greatest Holy Leaf are among these, and even a cannon  ball from the siege of Tabarsi has been preserved. 

 Haifa pilgrims brought back instructions to emphasize the advancement of women and of youth, and the urgency of voting and studying the Administrative Order. 

The Central Woman's Progress

 Committee was formed in 101; work accomplished included teaching literacy and other subjects to Baha'i village women. 

 The National Baha'i body sent out a circular on the progress of woman, including a translation from the Master's address in Philadelphia, June 9, 1912, and urged the Baha women not to lag behind their sisters of the West, stressing that the Persian Baha'is are striving to acquire the good qualities of western peoples, but reject false social standards including various types of dancing and dress current in the West. Literacy, knowledge of the Faith, and general  knowledge, are the N.S.A~'s current goals for all Baha'i women of 

Persia.                    

 The N.S.A. is doing much to abolish the use of opium. Those using opium may not serve on Assemblies or committees until they have discarded the practice; the buyer, seller and smoker of the drug are all held culpable, and Baha'i property owners and farmers are urged to abandon cultivation of the opium poppy. 

 The voting age in Persia was changed from 20 to 21; the age limit for youth is now 30; oniy youth may serve on local youth committees. A function of youth in large centers is to act as a liaison between them and the other local Assemblies in their area. 

 The Unity of the East and West Committee  entertains foreign visitors to the capital, and provides lectures for them in foreign languages. It translates articles into and from Persian and in general is an important link between Baha'is around the world. 
                           
      BRITISH ISLES              

  In this long-enduring citadel of western civilization the valiant spirit of faith has remained  steadfast during the years of war, gathering its forces for a determined proclamation  of the religion of God. From reports relating events during the years 19441946 prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly, the following passages are chosen for their emphasis on the new and greater plan of action adopted at the 

Centenary Convention.      

 "Moved and thrilled by the successful opening of the Centenary celebrations, we gathered for the annual Convention, at which occurred another event of the greatest importance, namely the resolution to adopt a Six-Year Plan for teaching the Faith, to terminate at the Centenary of the Martyrdom  of the BTh in 1950. The Guardian was asked by cable to fix the goal at which we should aim and replied suggesting the formatiOn of nineteen local assemblies situated in all the various countries of the British Isles. Truly a great task for the energies of a new century. The Guardian subsequently wrote us, emphasizing the importance of the work we were undertaking: tThe English believers stand identified with this Plan.' We are coming, perhaps only rather slowly, to understand  what this means, to realize that everything we do as a community, everything  in our individual lives, must be entirely devoted to it, so that it must be the primary aim always before us all. It would perhaps be fair to say that, although concrete achievements this year may be small, we have acquired some realization of what the task involves and seen, too, some of the practical difficulties that will have to be overcome. Our next and urgent step is to


<p49>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             49

  arise, both as a community and as individuals,  to carry out the plan, and this depends  largely on our being able to realize, to really deeply understand, what the successful  conclusion of the Plan means, not oniy to the Baha'i community, but to the country at large, which is yet unconscious of the new Revelation still so siowiy and so modestly being brought to its notice. So far we seem not entirely ready to take this next step — though one is preparing to go, no pioneer has yet arisen who has cast all other interests aside, moved to a fresh town and settled down to teach the Faith steadily and build up a community. 

 As. we said, one is just preparing to go, but many more are needed and until, at any rate, a good proportion  of the needed pioneers have been speeded on their way, we cannot honestly say that the Six-Year Plan has properly started, because experience in other countries where the Baha'i community has developed and expanded earlier than here has shown that pioneer settlement is an integral and essential part of the work. 

 ttllaving so discussed the needs of the plan and what lies before us, let us list the steps which have been taken to bring the Plan into being and to lay its foundations. 

 The first step was to form a committee to consider the whole situation and the best way to proceed. 

 They suggested setting a goal of nine pioneers to be settled by Convention of 1946 (hoping by then we should be benefiting by the end of the war and the subsequent  changing of jobs, etc.) and a further ten by 1947, after that everyone to go all out to finish forming assemblies in each place settled. 

 They also listed the places where work had been done and it seemed possible to do more, and some other places where it would be desirable to try and establish communities.  They are now engaged in gathering together information about the various places, for the help of pioneers as they arise to go to them. 

     "Meanwhile, the National  

 Assembly, convinced  that to strengthen the existing communities  is a basic part of the Six-Year Plan work, since it is from their ranks that most of the pioneers and other helpers will come, has urged on the local assemblies the need for striving for ever closer unity amongst the members of their communities, so that not only will they be stronger and function better, but they will also acquire more and more the spiritual attraction which will draw other people to the 

Faith.                    

 tCTWO more committees were set up to help with the Plan. Firstly, a committee to prepare and distribute a Postal Study Course on the Teachings and on matters useful to Baha'i teachers, in order to help all the believers,  whether in communities or alone, to forward the Plan. Also, after the experience of the Centenary celebrations, it was thought that Baha'i exhibitions had a very useful function in calling attention of the public to the Faith, especially when such exhibitions can be held in an empty shop in a main street of a town where work is already being done or is about to commence. A committee was therefore appointed to remodel the material used for the Centenary exhibition and make it suitable for general use. This was done and the material has already been in use; it is hope4 that many more of these exhibitions  will be held as time goes on and opportunity offers. 

 "Meanwhile pending the settlement of pioneers, the ordinary teaching work has gone on, in some cases in towns where there is one or more believers already living, in others where there are none, though it is very difficult to work in a town where there is not at least one resident Baha'i. 

 "The most steady and satisfactory teaching  work has been done by two groups, Northampton and Blackburn. Northampton is still unable to find a center, but have kept on with their fortnightly meetings, holding them for part of the year in a caf6 and for a while in private homes, and their meetings are well attended. They have also kept the I 9-Day Feasts regularly and have in fact become an organized community, though still a small one. Blackburn built up interest first by advertisements in a local paper and, even before starting meetings, had twenty inquiries. Last November they started to hold regular fortnightly meetings, which have been well attended. The patient work of one believer over a long period of years is thus finally bearing fruit. Various visiting speakers have helped both groups and both have started a lending library to

50               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  help inquirers. Northampton has two new believers and Blackburn one. 

 CtLil has also for some• time held regular meetings with an interested attendance, and the one local believer has been helped by a visiting teacher from Manchester, who has gone over to speak at a number of the meetings. For a while a regular  series of meetings was held in Nottingham, but results were not very encouraging, though interest in the Faith is there as we know from the large number of answers to advertisements. Visiting speakers went up for some of them, others were taken by two believers, who both live about ten miles away from Nottingham. 

 It is not easy to keep up a sustained interest when nobody lives there, but we hope to have a pioneer there soon. We held a small Centenary exhibition there. Blackpool is just now waking up and some people are showing interest in the Faith, and a book has been accepted by the public library, with a promise that another may be considered later. 

 Other places where meetings have been held include Ilkeston, Coventry, Birmingham and Buxton, where we took a halt during Summer School. like-ston  also had a small Centenary exhibition, not well attended but very well reported in the local paper, which also noticed the Centenary itself. During the year, work has also been started in Norwich — quite a number of people were contacted whilst a believer in the Army was stationed there and several meetings were held. There is one new believer,  who is now alone there. 

 ttThough no new assemblies have been formed during the year, there have been sixteen  new believers, four of them not yet of voting age, and one believer came from America to live here. Against this, three of the believers have passed on and one, an American who accepted the Faith here, has returned to the United States. 

 Mr. Dowson of Sydney, N.S.W., is working here for some months. He has been in London and is now in Preston, Lancashire, and is able to help in Blackburn. 

 We have been in contact with several Baha'is serving in the U. S. Army here and one is at present a member of the London community. He recently spent a week's leave travelling around from one community or pioneer believer to another, paying short visits — a wonderful way of demonstrating the worldwide unity of the Faith. 

 CCTh communities have all worked hard during the year. London hoped, of course, to get a lot of new visitors at their meetings after the publicity given by the Centenary celebrations. 

 Unfortunately, about a fortnight  afterwards the flying-bombs started, followed later by the rockets, which con —  siderably reduced the attendance at public functions of any sort. They have, however, held their meetings regularly and have had a number of new visitors. 

 They have experimented with different forms of meeting on the various Sundays of the month, in an effort to appeal to different tastes, having sometimes a talk, sometimes a devotional meeting and sometimes a meeting at which questions are answered. They also held two meetings on weekday evenings in order to meet the convenience of inquirers who could not come on 

Sunday afternoons. Their Naw-Rjiz

 Feast had a record attendance, larger than ever before, the Center being completely crowded out. They have also held two large public meetings, one a purely Baha one, the other on rather different lincs in cooperation with other organizations. The Baha'i meeting was held at Ealing and was attended by about forty fresh people, the sublect being tWorld Citizenship.' 

 It received quite a lot of attention in the local press. 

 The other meeting, held in a hail in the center of London, was initiated by us but was organized in cooperation with several other organizations interested in the subject,  which was ~First Steps towards World Unity.' Three wellknown people, unconnected  with any of the organizations, spoke, followed by a Baha'i who summed up in the spirit of the Teachings, without, however, mentioning the Faith by name. They are intending to hold another such joint meeting.  Besides these big meetings, speakers have been sent to various other organizations. Two fireside meetings have been held regularly, one at South Kensington and the other at Ealing. 

 One public library has accepted a book and one a subscription to New World Order, and one bookseller has held a display of 

Baha'i books. London       

 has had one new believer during the year and three believers

  absent on National Service have also returned to swell their ranks. 

 "Although many of the friends from other communities attended the national Centenary celebrations in London, the communities  also held their own celebrations a little later on. Manchester's effort took the form of an exhibition similar to the London one, combined with a series of public meetings.  The exhibition was visited by approximately 200 people and the meetings also attracted  a number of interested friends. 

 They have also been advertising the Faith in Manchester papers regularly and have had both postal inquirers and visitors. They have held their meetings regularly, for a time having also a short devotional meeting prior to th~ public talks. 

 They also ran a study group for some months. 

 The Youth Group too, has continued to function, holding reguflr meetings and sending its bulletins to young Baha'is in various parts of the country. Manchester finished the year with a shop exhibition  in Salford and they hope to have others in different districts of Manchester in the near future. They have SIX new believers. 

 ~tBradford, too, held a local Centenary celebration, also in the form of an exhibition, but this time in an empty shop in the center of the town. During a week they obtained 220 names in the visitors' book and a number  also did not sign. They finished the week with a public meeting. They have held their public meetings regularly and also had a regular study class. Bradford is badly handicapped  still by ill-health and by the number of young members absent on National Serv —  ice, but one has just returned to Bradford on discharge from the Army and will be able to help the work there. 

 "Torquay's Centenary celebration took the form of an exhibition of Baha'i books in a shop window and they had a bookstall in the entrance to the shop, which is right un derneath their Center. They also held meet ings every evening that week, taken entirely by local speakers, as Torquay was then a prohibited area, which was a great effort for a small community. 

 They advertised in the local press, which also published articles about the celebrations. 

 The young people's social evenings, run by Mrs. Matthews and Mrs. 'White, reported on last year, have developed a great deal. The young people are now taking an interest in the Faith and are interesting their parents, some of whom attend  the Sunday meetings and are reading Baha'i books. Also some of the mothers are helping with the social evenings. The little group collaborated in the International Youth Day on March 4th, with other Baha'i groups all over the world. Not being yet declared Baha'is, they did nor attempt the rather ambitious program mapped out by the International Youth Committee, but they held a social meeting and invited their parents and friends and talks on the Faith were given. 

 A Baha'i talk was given to the local Theosophical Society and attempts have been made to establish contacts in Newton Abbot and Exerter, though not yet with much success. 

 "In spite of the fact that Bournemouth have still not been able to find premises for a center, they have had a suc~essfu1 year, having increased their members by four new believers, one a youth member, and with three more just declaring themselves now. Having no center, their work is mostly done at fireside meetings in private homes and at one time they had as many as five fireside meetings going during a week. Miss South also rented a room at the Psychology Club and gave weekly talks, every alternate one being devoted to the BaWi'i Faith. 

 "We have not gone in for as much press publicity this year, either in the form of advertisements or otherwise. So far as advertising  was concerned, in several towns it seemed that our advertisements were no longer attracting much attention and that all possible inquirers had already written, and it was therefore considered advisable to give them a rest for a little while, with the idea of starting again later if active work was being done there, especially to support a pioneer. At the moment the only ones actually running are in The Esperantist which over several years has brought and continues to bring a small but steady stream of inquirers, and in a Nottingham paper which we are keeping on to pave the way for the pioneer we hope to have there soon.

  licity agent who helped us for the Centenary. After some negotiation and some delay, this was arranged and he started work. 

 We soon came to the conclusion, however, that for the present, on account of the great events happening  coupled with the small available newspaper space, it was not likely that much publicity could be obtained for the Faith this way and, at the suggestion of the publicity officer himself, the agreement was terminated  after three months. One thing which we did, however, at his suggestion has proved quite useful. He obtained messages to the Baha'i community for 

Naw-Riiz from Dame Sybil   
Thorndike, Miss Ethel      

 Mannin, Mr. Shaw Desmond, Mr. Clifford Bax, Mr. Reginald  Sorensen, M.P., and Mr. Christmas Humphreys, president of the Buddhist Society.  These messages were featured in advertisements of the Faith which have been appearing weekly in the personal columns of The Times, The Manchester 

Guardian and The Yorkshire 

 Post. Quite a number of inquiries  have been received. An article on the Faith has appeared in Cavalcade and favorable reviews have appeared in the John o' Groats 

Journal.                   

 ttThere has been another form of publicity,  worked by one of the friends. 

Mrs. Rideout of Amesbury   

 is a member of the panel of people who regularly report on the B.B.C. religious programs. She frequently quotes from the Baha Writings in her reports  and has also urged that the BJ3.C. allow a Baha'i talk. 

 eCNew World Order has continued to appear  this year, though at rather longer intervals  on account of printing difficulties. One number was devoted almost entirely to an account of the Centenary celebrations and a report of the speeches given. The number of annual subscriptions has remained about the same — the communities have taken larger supplies but subscriptions amongst individual believers have not increased. 

 some time we have had a small cob lection of books which we lend to postal inquirers. During the year some books used a few years ago by the 

National Teaching Committee

 were added to this small store and now with the addition of some more books it has been formed into a National Lending Library, which is at the service both of inquirers and of those Baha'is who do not have access to the library of a local corn —  munity, with the special aim of helping pioneers. 

 "As in previous years, we have been able to hold our various national functions, namely Summer School and the Teaching Conference, Summer School was held at Buxton. Accommodation was limited and was further complicated by staff difficulties, so that we could only take forty people for the Bank Holiday weekend and half that number for the rest of the week. 

 However, in spite of this the school was a great success.  With the Six-Year Plan in mind and the fact that nearly all the people attending were Baha'is, it was devoted exclusively to subjects which would help prepare them for teaching. 

The Teaching Conference    

 was as itual held in Manchester in January, and was well attended. Everyone remarked that the discussion was more practical and that there was a more alive and active spirit in the gathering. 

 "On the legal side, we have during the year, continued our efforts to get suitable changes made in our Articles of Association, in order that the Inland Revenue will exempt us from tax. The matter moves very siowiy, mainly because the Chief Inspector of Taxes has not yet approved of the amendments we have suggested. The position is at the moment that we have consulted Counsel on the matter and the solicitor has sent a further  letter based on Counsel's suggestions. We are also consulting the solicitor about amending the clause which provides for a Convention of 19 delegates, so that when needed through the progress of the Six-Year Plan, a larger number of delegates may be elected. 

 ccTowards the end of this year events in the world have moved and we have once more been in touch with some of our fellow believers on the Continent of Europe. 

David Hofman visited Paris 
and saw the believers there.

 We have also corresponded with them and sent two parcels over to them. 

 We have also received a letter from one of the believers  in Lyons and have been in touch again with the International 

Bureau at Geneva.          

 ctThe story of the Cause this year started with two important events, the celebration


<p53>
CURRENT BAHA'! ACTIVITIES             53

  of the first Centenary of the Faith, which was a Baha'i world event, and an event concerning our British community, the adoption of the Six-Year Plan. The first event has come and gone and is now part of our history, the second, even now after the passing of a year, lies almost entirely in the future. The Guardian has said that the Plan constitutes  a landmark in the history of the Faith in the British Isles and that the immediate destinies of the entire community depend upon it. These words need surely to be pondered  carefully by all of us. Never before has the Baha'i community in this country been called upon to face so clearly the implications  involved in acceptance of the Baha'i Faith and the responsibility which that entails to spread the Faith to others. We are now confronted with a very definite and concrete task, to establish the Cause in nineteen towns in the British Isles in the coming five years, for a Five-Year Plan is what it has now become, and the job still remains before us. As we have said, the first step is the establishment of pioneers, at least one in all these nineteen places. That must be done before anything else and everything else must yield place to this task. 

 The Guardian assures us that twhen once a few bold, self-sacrificing individuals have arisen to serve, their example will no doubt encourage  other timid wouldbe pioneers to follow in their footsteps' and reminds us that tthe history of our Faith is full of records  of the remarkable things achieved by really very simple, insignificant individuals, who become veritable beacons and towers of strength through having placed their trust in God and having arisen to proclaim His Message.' 

 'Abdu'l-Baha wrote to the English  believers, no doubt foreseeing these times we are living in now: tThey must not rest day or night but strive to illumine the children of men, and awaken souis. 

 This is not the day of silence. This is not the day of rest'." 
                           
    ThE SIX-YEAR PLAN          

  Convention 1944 was held in London during the week of the Centenary celebrations. 

 It was distinguished by a strong feeling, shared by delegates and other friends alike, that there was need for the community as a whole to enter some clear definitive process in its work, in order to concentrate and direct its energies, which so far were general and largely unrelated, towards some specific goal. This feeling found expression in the following cable to the Guardian: —  "Co ention desires Six-Year 

Plan terminate  Centenary 

 martyrdom Mb begs you signify goal to be achieved." 

 To this the Guardian replied: —  (twelcome spontaneous decision. 

Advise                     
formation nineteen Baha'i   

Spiritual Assemblies      

 spread over England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Eire praying signal victory." 

 Thus was born the Six-Year Plan. Of it the Guardian has said the following in successive  communications: —  "The Six-Year Plan which the 

English                    

 believers have conceived and are now energetically prosecuting constitutes a landmark in the history of the Faith in the British Isles. 

 It is the first collective enterprise undertaken by them for the spreaA of the Faith and the consolidation of its divinely appointed institutions." 

 ttThe Plan constitutes a direct and grave challenge to the English Baha'i community in its entirety. 

 It should be regarded as the greatest collective enterprise ever launched by the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the British Isles. It is, thus far, one of the most significant undertakings embarked upon by the members of the Ba1A'i National Assemblies during the opening years of the second Baha'i century. 

 To it, as already observed, the immediate destinies of the community  of the English believers are linked, and on it must depend the future orientation and evolution of the institutions which the members of that community are laboring to erect for the diffusion of the principles, and the establishment of the Faith, of Baha'u'llah in their country." 

 So important a task, fraught, as the Guardian indicates, with such implications for the future, at first fell lightly upon the consciousness of the community, and it was oniy as the practical requirements of the Plan came to be understood that the friends began to realize what an enormous undertak


<p54>
54              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ing confronted them. Considerations, for instance,  such as the f allowing: — 1.     In six years the community must be more than doubled, if the nineteen Spiritual Assemblies are to be established. 

 2.     Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Eire are virgin territories, requiring pioneers to establish the Faith there. 

 3.     The smallness of our numbers and resources makes settling of believers to form communities impracticable, and we shall have to count on a large influx of believers. This seems to indicate that the time has arrived  when people will come to the Faith "in troops." Our own knowledge and Vision must be adequate. 

 The N.S.A. appointed a Committee whose chief function before being dissolved was to suggest a plan of action. This was adopted with minor modifications by the N.S.A. and is now in process of beitig carried out. 

 Simply,  it is this: —  In the early stages of the Plan the nineteen new places should be tCpj~~ pointed," and the later stages should be occupied  with a continual teaching circuit, directing all the forces of the community towards the development of Spiritual Assemblies  round the nineteen pinpoints. 

 The N.S.A. aims at nine pinpoints by Convention 1946, nineteen by Convention 1947; the remaining three years to be devoted to a concerted effort to bring all nineteen places to community status. 

 "With regard to the communities: London  has had rather a changeful year. Its members have been increased by the return of several evacuated members, now that the war is over and by the removal of several friends from other parts of the country. On the other hand the oniy two pioneers at the moment at work for the Six-Year Plan have been contributed by London. Changes in the London assembly and its officers halfway through the year were caused by their departure  together with other resignations for various reasons. Their meetings have varied in form and in time during the year but have not attracted very many people and the community  can report only two new believers. On the other hand, London contributed the bulk of the speakers for the Hyde Park venture,  reported further on in this report, which was originally organized by the N.S.A. though later turned over to London. In order to contact people for whom Sunday is not a suitable day, they also held periodic meetings on a weekday evening. 

 They held a large public meeting in a hired hail in July, in conjunction with two other organizations, and they also took an active part in the two meetings organized by the N.S.A. at the time of the UNO meetings. 

Both the Preparatory Commission

 and the General Assembly of the United Nations met not many yards from the London Center and during the meetings of the latter a large notice of welcome to the delegates was displayed  in the Center windows. London is also experimenting with another form of publicity, namely posters in buses. Another attempt to attract people to the Center took the form of an Art Exhibition, which displayed  the work of Baha'i artists and of a friend associated with the Cause for many years. 

 In this way a number of people were led to make the acquaintance of the Center. Talks have been given to various other organizations. 

 London has kept all the big feasts and the commemoration meetings have been held and attended by some at the proper times, though repeat meetings have been held for those who could not attend night meetings.  Fireside meetings have been held at various times of the year in different parts of London, one of the new believers being a result of the Ealing fireside meetings-~Manchester has been working very hard and can report a good measure of success, with six new believers. Since January their public meetings have grown from just a handful till now they get an average of thirty, and they have also held a number of fireside meetings. 

 At the beginning of the year they held a shop exhibition in Salford. Not many inquirers followed up their initiate interest at the exhibition by attending meetings, but many must have been made familiar with the Faith. A very important feature of Manchester's work has been the effort to develop Altrincham — over the years much work has been done there and now prospects are so encouraging that Manchester hopes it will be adopted as one of the goal towns of the 

Six-Year Plan. Manchester Youth

 Group has continued to hold regular meetings and sends its monthly newsletter

  to a very wide circle, both in this country and abroad. 

 "Bournemouth has had rather a diflicult year. An unhappy situation arose when it was discovered that one believer had not properly understood the Baha teachings on spiritualism. 

 These were explained and the Guardian also wrote a full explanation, but she withdrew from the Cause and two others followed her, on account of this and other teachings which they found they could not accept. The community has been further weakened in numbers by the departure of two voting members and two youth members for London, and it now finds itself with only just enough members to justify an assembly. 

 As some of these are often ill and unable to attend assembly meetings, it is very difficult for the assembly to function properly.  Nevertheless active teaching work has been done all the time. Most of it has taken the form of fireside meetings, since they arc still unable to find a place for a center, but a big public meeting was held in February, which was very well attended, and Baha'is have also spoken to other groups like the Esperantists. The little handful who do the active work in Bournemouth deserve a sin. cere tribute for the way in which they are keeping the community and the teaching work going. 

 ccTorquay shows a great example of what a small community can do. Though only lust over the minimum number for an assembly, and at that not all members are able to be active, they keep their public meetings going regularly, and their young people's weekly meeting has become not oniy a social evening but also a study class held on a separate evening. 

 But more than that, they have undertaken active extension work, trying  to work up a circle of interested people in Exeter. Regular meetings have been held there since January and Torquay believers have travelled there to hold them, undeterred by the worst of the winter weather. Though they could not find a very suitable hail there and though audiences have been small, they have one or two people who attend  regularly and who are trying to help make further contacts. 

 This is a really fine contribution to the Six-Year Plan by such a small community. 

 ttBradford suffered more than any other community by the absence of members on National Service and they have been glad to welcome back two of them since the war ended, to help in the community work. Others have still to come home but should arrive before long. Meetings have been held regularly and have been taken both by members of the local community and by visiting speakers. 

 Baha'i talks have also been given to other organizations such as the International Friendship League and the Bradford Business Men's Club and have aroused much interest. A well-supported study class has also been held. One of the newspapers has given them periodic writeups. Five members of the Bradford community, which has up till now included Leeds in its area, live in the latter city and they have recently' started intensive teaching work there, fully supported by the Bradford Assembly. 

 Leeds has been adopted as one of the goal towns of the Six-Year Plan and, as already mentioned, recently a shop exhibition was held for a fortnight in one of the main streets beginning  and ending with a big public meeting. 

 The Leeds believers, helped by other members of the Bradford community, put a lot of hard work into this campaign; it made an excellent beginning to their local teaching, which is being continued by fireside  meetings. 

 "Though many of the wartime difficulties still persist, the Publishing Trust has worked hard during the year. Seven publications have actually been received from the printers during the year, including the 1946 diaries. Several of these are pamphlets, none of them very big books. Three more are at present in the hands of the printer. A long list of books and pamphlets is planned and most of them are in the course of preparation. 

 t(On the administrative side, we have at last completed the arrangements for the change in the Assembly's Articles of Association  as a private company, which we spoke of in last year's report. 

 The Chief Inspector  of Taxes eventually approved the draft submitted to him, and the changed wording has been incorporated in the Articles  and approved by the High Court of Justice,

  accepted as a socalled tcharitable' body, which includes religious bodies, with consequent  remission of tax. At the same time the clause regarding the number of delegates to the Annual Convention has been changed to allow of expansion as the number of believers  in the country grows. 

 "At the request of one of the local assemblies the N.S.A. drafted the wording for a marriage certificate, which it is proposed to have printed after the Guardian has approved it.    This certificate will of course have no legal standing — it is simply a certificate that a Baha'i marriage has taken place. 

 tcThe current Baha'i year has seen the end of the fighting both in Europe and in the Far East. Already last year we could report being once more in touch with the friends in France and Switzerland. This year letters have been received from believers in Holland, Norway, and Czechoslovakia, and just a few weeks ago the ban on communication with Germany was lifted, so we hope to be hearing from the friends there also very soon. The goode news has just been received that they have reestablished their National Spiritual Assembly, which was suspended in 1937. 

 "Th end of the war has meant a focussing  of public interest more and more on the new organization by which it is hoped that future war will be avoided and the nations come to live harmoniously with each other. The General Assembly of the United Nations Organization held its first meeting in 

London in January. All    

 the delegates were sent a letter of welcome from the British Baha'i Community, together with a leaflet containing  passages from the 'Writings on the subject  of World Government. 

 One delegate from Ethiopia sent us a letter of thanks. Further, whilst public interest was focussed on efforts to develop international co-opera-non,  a public meeting was held on January 9th in London, at Carton Hall, which is very near the place where the UNO General Assembly  was meeting. Attendance was not so large as was hoped, as the weather was bad, but discussion was interesting. 

 A further but smaller meeting on the same lines was held on April 17th. 

 ttA little while before the UNO meeting, a World Youth Conference was held in London.  It was not possible for us to take any part, as the meetings were confined to delegates, except for a big one at the Albert Hall which some Baha'is attended. 

 A letter of good wishes was sent to the Conference and the secretary was asked to place some free literature in the meeting room. 

 ~tFo11owing statements in the House of Commons sympathetic to the idea of world government, both the Foreign Minister, Mr. Bevin, and Mr. Anthony Eden, were sent letters and literature. Mr. Bevin's private secretary sent a cordial letter of thanks. 

 ceThere have been two new activities in our community life this year, which it is intended will be repeated in coming years. One was the commemoration on September 11th of the anniversary of 'Abdu'l-Baha's first public talk in the West. 

 The other was the attempt to attract people to the Faith by talking about it at the open air forum in Hyde Park. For a number of Sunday mornings,  several London believers gave talks there to good crowds. 

 Winter weather obliged them to stop for some months but it is intended to start again very soon, as this is a good way of introducing the Faith to large numbers of people. 

 ~Tor the first time for some years we have had a Youth Committee. It has worked entirely  by correspondence, as its membership was drawn from all parts of the country. 

 It has produced a report on methods of attracting young people, which has been sent to all local assemblies, and it is now working on the possibility of producing a Youth Bulletin  and also on the program for a Youth Day at Summer School."

  Cairo, a cultural capital of IslAm, has become the seat of one of the most impressive Baha'i national headquarters yet constructed in East or West. Built to serve as seat of the Centenary celebrations, this Haziratu'1-Quds has created much interest in the Baha'i message, as the reports of the Egyptian Assembly  testify. 

 ~The completion of the Ha~iratu'1-Quds in time for the Centenary, and the magnificent  manner in which the sacred occasion was celebrated therein were but a majestic call announcing the glad tidings of the new spirit infused in the body of creation, a new

  inspiration destined to elevate the world of humanity, and a new life exhilarated by the Divine Love. For, just as the building, with its beautiful location, excited the curiosity of the multitudes, the celebrations, in their turn, extended its significance and purpose far and near. 

 "The banner of the Greatest Name was unfurled, and the Teachings and Principles widely disseminated. Groups of inquirers called at all hours in such increasing numbers  that the Baha'is scarcely found time to carry on their administrative work. 

 "The following message dated July 17th, 1945 was received from the Beloved Guardian, through his secretary: —  tHe was very happy to read of the wonderful  progress made by the Faith in Egypt during the past year in the annual report; likewise the reports of the convention and Centenary celebrations rejoiced his heart, and he felt moved, in view of the activity and devotion of the believers there, to launch them upon a new field of service, namely teaching and establishing the Cause in new localities. 

 In India, Persia and America wonderful  results have been obtained by Baha'i pioneers and settlers, who, leaving their homes, have founded new areas in places where the Faith was unknown and have been able to raise its banner in many virgin fields. 

 CH feels that the time has now come for the beloved Egyptian friends to likewise take this important step, and he has therefore contributed one thousand pounds to be used to help finance pioneers and aid in the general teaching work.' 
                           
NEW SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLIES   
FORMED                     

  ttAccording to the scheme of teaching the Cause and establishing new 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 through Baha'i pioneers and settlers, the National Spiritual Assembly was able to raise the number of existing Spiritual Assemblies  to seven by constituting three more Assemblies, one each in Suez, Tanta and Sohag, whereby the number of centers was proportionally increased. Efforts are being made to encourage the believers to settle in more centers where it is hoped Spiritual Assemblies  can be formed, and new centers established." 

          SUDAN                      

  tcAided by the confirmation of Baha'u'llah,  two of the believers Hassan Effendi El Saeed of Port-Said, and Rashad Effendi El Hamamsy of Cairo, were able to settle in Kharti~m, Sudan. Accompanied by their families, they left on January 23rd and February 27th, 1944, respectively. 

 tSince their arrival in Khartiim, the Baha'is there were greatly encouraged and inspired. The report of Rashed Effendi, who was transferred back to Egypt after six months stay in Kharti5m, is replete with joyful  news. The number of existing, accredited Baha'is in Kharnim is nine, and another believer  lives in Singa. The Cause is also attracting  the interest of still others in this area. 

 The center in KhartAm is well organized  in accordance with Baha 

Administration.  Meetings 

 are regularly held on Sundays and the nineteen day Feasts are well attended. They have established a small library, and are in constant communication with the National 

Spiritual Assembly."       
                           
         ETHIOPIA                   

  "Sabri Effendi Elias, of Alexandria, was able to return to Ethiopia, after a prolonged absence dating from the outbreak of the Italian war against 

Ethiopia in 1935. He       

 departed  for Addis Ababa on January 23rd, 1944. 

 (cstopping for a few days in Khartiim he met the Baha'is of Sudan, and shared with them the joyful news of the progress of the Cause. 

 was accompanied by his wife who is likewise giving hearty support in serving the Cause in that country. 

 Their reports show that the Word of God is being promoted  in a wonderful way, and it is our earnest hope that these friends will succeed in obtaining a permanent stay in Ethiopia. 
                           
PERSECUTIONS CONTINUE      

  CCAS the Cause achieves more progress and spreads its influence over new areas in Egypt, its adherents, in like manner, are exposed to attacks of the ignorant masses, aroused and stirred by their fanatic leaders. 

 The persecutions  instigated during 1944, and particularly since the Centenary celebrations were


<p58>
58              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  held, testify to the fact that there is an organized and antagonistic movement tending  to stop, or at least to impede, the progress of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, which the opponents  consider a threat to the Faith of IsUm, and destructive to its authority. 

 "Motivated by an assumption neither based on sound foundations nor the product of a sincere search for truth the Shari'ah Moslem courts from time to time consider cases of individual Baha'is and thereupon issue groundless, misleading and illogical judgments involving the worst consequences they can conceive. 

 "These verdicts are published in certain newspapers, which to our regret, do not also publish our replies to these false charges. As a result, the fanatic elements find reinforcement  and vindication for the attacks they launch against the 

Baha'is.                   
    "In Tanta, where a Spiritual

 Assembly had been newly established, a serious disturbance took place and the Baha'is are still suffering from the attacks of the aroused mobs. 

 A number of them were beaten and even the policemen bad great trouble in dispersing the agitators. 

 ttAnri-BahA'i proclamations were circu-lared  throughout the city, defaming the Baha'i Cause, and warning the people against association with the Baha'is. In order to spread the warning to the utmost, the instigators took the occasion of the month of RamadTh, the Moslem month of fasting. This being a seasonal custom they published a timetable in which they quoted many excerpts  from the last verdict issued by the Shari'ah courts of Arish, in 1944, by which Baha'is are considered heretics, who have deviated from the Moslem religion; being thus apostate, their marriage contracts with Moslems become null. A charge against the instigators was brought by the Baha'is and is now under consideration. 
                           
BAHA'I MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES
                           
    NOT YET RECOGNIZED         

 t~A Baha'i marriage certificate issued by the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo was presented by Mohamed Effendi Kamal of Beni-Suef,  to the Immigration Department, with a view to obtaining a permanent stay in Egypt for his wife, a Palestinian subject. 

 (CHis application was not approved, on the ground that the Baha'i Faith is nor recognized  by the Egyptian government, and consequently Baha'i marriage certificates could not be regarded as legal documents. His wife was thereupon requested to quit Egypt. An appeal has been submitted to high authorities for further consideration. 

  Negotiations With the 

Government                 

  "The current persecutions, the frequent judgments issued by the Shari'ah Moslem Courts on cases of Baha'i individuals, the judgment of the Grand Mufti of IsUm of Egypt by which he proclaimed the independent  status of the Baha'i Faith, and the critical position affecting the affairs of the Baha'i community in general, have recently been considered by the 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 t~The memorandum is in preparation through which the Baha'is hope to receive the sympathetic consideration of the government,  whereby, in the light of the facts of the matter, it will not hesitate to extend protection to the Egyptian Baha'is, and give them the right to enjoy the privileges sanctioned  by Constitutional Law on an equal footing with other religious communities. 
                           
  Publishing Activities      

 (cThree committees have been charged with the responsibility of translating Baha'i literature, and of furnishing articles to the newspapers on every possible occasion. 
 CCThe tDispcnsarion of     

Baha'u'llah,' the Historic  

 Survey of the Centenary, as well as other items of interest have been translated  into Arabic and are now in process of publication. 'God Passes By' is now being translated. 
                           
    SUPPORT FROM 'IRAQ         

  "These undertakings were greatly encouraged  by the kind message received from 'IrAq, in which the 

National Spiritual Assembly 

 expressed their desire to share half of the expenses. 

 "An article was supplied to the Masri (newspaper), commenting on the activities of the Baha'is of America in connection with the 

San Francisco Conference.  

 The comment expressed the high appreciation of

  the Baha'is of Egypt, and dealt mainly with the principles of tFreedom of Thought'; tFreedom of Belief'; ~Oneness of Religion'; and the CAbd t of all Prejudices.' 
                           
       BAHA' SCHOOL               

  "For the first time a 

Baha'i Summer School      
in Egypt was organized.    

 It is beautifully  situated at Port Eouad, opposite Port Said, on the Eastern bank of the Suez, and overlooks the Mediterranean Sea. 

 A fifteen day program was held from July 15th to 3 0th. 

 "Seventeen members from different places in Egypt, attended the school. 

 Many interesting  subjects were studicd, and lectures and debates were also included in the program. 

 "The results were cxcellent indeed, and it is hoped that a session of the schooi, on a wider scope, will be arranged next year. 

  'IRAQ In proceeding from country to country to survey the condition of the Baha community,  one is constantly reminded how thoroughly the world has prepared for enmity  and strife, and how pitifully ineffective has been any preparation even for the idea of peace. 

 Truth has had to serve in a garrison,  and fellowship has been confined in a prison girt by many walls, from racialism to nationalism, and from class interest to prejudice of creed. 

 In one part of the world the Baha'i community is oppressed by the state; in another part by the mosque. Marked and conditioned by its own particular tradition, each Baha'i community to some extent struggles with the psychic ghost of opposition after the actual opposition has ceased. 

 But the ifiany Baha'i communities, diverse as they out —  wardly may be, weak and ineffective as they may appear, more and more rapidly take on the characteristics of the only true world community that can exist today. 

 Moral energy  and mental clarity steadily increase among the Baha'is, since they are related to the creative power which gathers the peo-pies  together to produce mankind. 

 In 'Idq, as in Egypt and Persia, Isl&m makes the psychological environment in which the Baha'i community has developed. 

 Public facilities taken for granted in a country like America are denied the followers of Baha'u'llah in 'Iraq where ecciesiasticism has been the law and the court of the state. In such a theatre one can follow the dramatic course of events produced by the meeting of the old era and the new. Those who fail to attain unity with the Manifestation of God in His day can never agree among themselves. 

 That is why even a handful of true believers eventually become the axis around which the society revolves. 
   From the report of the     

National Spiritual Assembly

 of 'Idq the following excerpts arc taken: 

   SPREAD OF THE FAITH        

  t~The Teaching Committee has endeavored  to meet the increasing need of 

Baha'i literature. Study    

 groups were formed and held their sessions daily in the foundation hail of the Haziratu'1-Quds as well as in the homes of the friends in different parts of the city, for that urgent, vital purpose. 

 The meetings of these groups were presided over and directed by teachers of deep knowledge appointed by the National Teaching Committee  to encourage the hungry souTh of the beginners, and the seekers after truth through the Divine nourishment of the Baha'i revelation. 
                           
DISSEMINATION OF LITERATURE
                           
   "The National Spiritual    

 Assembly, in discharging its responsibility of diffusing the light of the Baha'i Faith and in instilling its celestial spirit in the heart of those seekers  after its truth, has placed large quantities  of Baha'i books and pamphlets, in various  languages at the disposal of the teaching  committee which has disseminated them among a great number of people of every religion, race, and rank throughout the country. 

 "As a direct consequence of these activities, a number of these inquirers were attracted  to the Faith and enlisted as believers in the New World 

Order of Baha'u'llah       

 and became active members in the Baha'i Community. 

 CtThe influence of these teaching activities was not restricted to the local areas of

  Baglidid, but has penetrated to other places of the country. Many friends of other centers  were stimulated by the Anniversary and rose up, with ~ new zeal, to promote the Baha'i Message in their respective centers. 

 !CReports from teachers reaching the National Spiritual Assembly show their splendid  activities in the field of teaching, and that people of every shade of opinion have been attracted to the Faith. 

The National Spiritual     

 Assembly hopes that in the fulness of time these will become the torch bearers of the Faith of 

Baha'u'llah.               
   "The Local Spiritual Assemblies

 of 'Ir4q, with the cooperation of the teaching committees, have extended valuable assistance to the management and organization of their teaching work, and of utilizing the capacities  and talents of the individuals for the welfare of the Faith. 

 and isolated believers in several localities such as Mosul, Karktik, 'Am~rih and 'Aziziyyih are in constant and direct touch with the National Spiritual Assembly and are receiving their spiritual support. Their report proved that teaching has become their highest goal in life, and their labors have resulted in the fruitage of a few new believers,  establishing a firm nucleus for a Baha'i community. The National Spiritual Assembly confidently hopes that through the confirmations of our beloved Guardian we shall have several new Local Assemblies in the near future. 
                           
   CHANNELS OF TEACHING       

  ttMeans and channels of teaching in 'Iraq are very limited. Owing to the deep religious fanaticism and ignorance of the large majority  of the people of 'IrAq, the only possible  means which the difficult environment offers for this important service is through personal contacts and individual teaching. The friends in 'Ir&q cannot overstep this limit for fear of still more repression which may injure the vital progress of the Faith. 

 "Publicity through newspapers and magazines,  a great instrument and very effective system for the promotion of the interests of the Faith, is not available to us. Editors in 'Iraq dare not publish an article in favor of the Faith. 

 They do not hesitate, however. 

 to publish articles, against the Faith whenever  the situation or their interest demand. 

 ttAnother valuable means for the enlightenment of the public about the Faith is the libraries. 

 Unfortunately, the librarians in tlrAq do not provide themselves with Baha'i books with the exception of an English library  where Baha'i books occasionally are found. 

 "Another important means for teaching is the lecture platform which is strictly denied  to the Baha'is of 'Iraq. There is no opportunity for any Baha'i to deliver a speech or give a talk to a group of people in 'Ir~iq. Another more important, more vital instrument for the promotion of the Faith is the press which is strictly forbidden to us. The National Spiritual Assembly has many times approached the authorities for legal permission to print some Baha'i literature, but each time this was flatly refused. 

 "It is painful to report that this great deprivation of vital rights has blocked the highway of teaching. 

The National Spiritual Assembly

 is at the present time following its former way of procuring the Baha literature  in the Arabic and Persian languages chiefly from Egypt. Attempts have been made to print some pamphlets abroad but it was found, after experience, that this method costs much more than that of printing  in the local press. 

 ttAnother more useful, more universal instrument for the promotion of the Message of Baha'u'llah is the radio broadcast which we can not employ to reach the people. 

 Were this most effective and comprehensive channel available to us we would have launched a nation wide campaign of teaching the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Radio broadcasting in 'Iraq is a governmental institution and is therefore under the control of the authorities and its use is restricted according to the interests of the government. Hence the only practical means remaining in operation under our disposal is the method of personal contacts  and the slow way of individual teaching which is so limited in its use, so narrow in its range, so restricted in its results, especially when capable and meritorious teachers are comparatively few.

    PUBLIC LmRARY PLAN         
                           
     "At the Fourteenth Annual  

 Convention of the Baha'is of 'Ir~q, it was resolved to establish a public library in Baghdad, to be chiefly devoted at its inception, to the best current literature, with a section dedicated to the Baha'i books. Gradually the Baha books may be increased in quantity until, in time, this library will become a Baha'i bookstall.  For some months the National Spiritual Assembly has been looking for a suitable  man whose knowledge and experience in teaching can utilize every opportunity offered by this library for teaching the Faith to the enlightened and intellectual classes of the people. The National Spiritual Assembly  has taken this matter very seriously, as it believes that this plan would in time be an institution of great benefit and far reaching interest to the Faith. The sum of ID. 2000/ as preliminary budget for the establishment of this vital plan has been al —  loted, and the committee concerned is doing its best to find a suitable shop for this purpose. 
                           
      ADMINISTRATION             
                           
 CCThe National Spiritual   

 Assembly has consecrated a great deal of its endeavors during the year covered by this report to consolidate the administrative order among the Local Assemblies and the National and Local 

Committees. The National   

 Spiritual Assembly realizes full well the importance of, and the necessity for, the consolidation of the Baha'i committees and the strict application of the Baha'i Administrative Order among the Baha'i institutions. To see that this was developed and established by the committees and individuals, the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 decided to visit the local assemblies to see how the principles and precepts  of the administrative order are being applied and to guide these assemblies to the best way of executing the Laws and Ordinances of the administrative order in discharging their duties and obligations. 

The National Spiritual     

 Assembly held a session in the village of 'AvAshiq, where it consulted with the local assembly and the believers of that village, as well as with representatives of the 

Baha'is of Ic1hy~bih.      

 This session lasted a day long during which time the National Spiritual Assembly had a good opportunity  to give them the necessary practical advice and counsel for better organization in their administrative transactions and the invigoration of their spiritual activities. 

 tcEurthermore the National Spiritual Assembly  studies carefully the records of the. sessions of all the local spiritual assemblies as well as all the suggestions made at the Nineteen-day Feasts of all the centers, with the intention of knowing the range and nature  of their activities, and is in direct contact and communication with all centers. Moreover, in most meetings of the Nineteen-day  Feasts, ].ectures are delivered and explanations  are made on the subject of administration  for the assistance of the believers and their increased understanding of the scope and range of this sacred Order of Baha'u'llah. 
                           
COMPLETION OF THE GUEST    
HOUSE                      

  "At the outset of this year the construction work of the Guest House was progressing  well, and nearing completion with the exception of fixing the doors and windows and electric equipment. 

 Then work was de.-layed and finally stopped on account of the shortage in building materials such as wood, window panes, etc., while the small quantities  of building materials which were to be found in the market stores were under the Government control and were not available for civil use. 

 "At the commencement of the work the authorities where quite reluctant and very strict about supplying the necessary materials  for the completion of the Guest House. The building was registered as a personal house in the name of a believer. 

 But the influx of the Persian pioneers and their lodging in the Guest House provoked and excited the suspicions and apprehension of the authorities and thereupon an order was issued stopping the work, and for a time the UaPratu'1-Quds was visited by many officials in order to be sure that this building is not intended to be used as a rest house or hotel for the Baha'i visitors and travellers. 

 tIn the meantime the National Spiritual Assembly was compelled to take immediate action for the evacuation of the Guest House which was actually occupied and over


<p62>
62              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  crowded by the Persian pioneers, and after great difficulty and energetic efforts, permission  for the completion of the Guest House was procured and work was resumed again. 

 By January of the present year the work was entirely completed. When our beloved Guardian was informed he graciously sent us the following message: ~The glad tidings telling of the completion  of the Guest House has been a source of immeasurable pleasure and extreme exhilaration  and is at the same time a brilliant proof to the arduous activity, laudable resolution, energetic endeavors and warm enthusiasm. 

 A copy of the photo of this construction will be placed in a chamber of the blessed Baha and another one will be reproduced in the Baha'i World ~o that the Baha'is of the East and of the 'West as well as the pilgrims 0± the Holy Land might see the high endeavors  of the representatives of the Baha'i community in the City of God and it would be the cause of pleasure and cheerfulness to the Baha'is of the East and of the West.' 

 ccThe total sum expended so far upon the construction of the Guest House amounts to ID. 12000/ — or about $48,000.00 a part of which the friends of 'Tr~q have contributed while the other part is a loan made by the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 against the mortgage of the building itself. 
                          
         THE HALL                  
   ~tThe National Spiritual  

 Assembly has made many arduous attempts to get permission  for the erection of the Hall which is the third, and last component part of the 

UaPratu'1-Quds. Having    

 succeeded in procuring the necessary permission from the municipality the plan of the Hall was f or. warded to the 

Ministry of Supplies      

 for the acquisition of materials. But the Ministry hesitated for a time claiming that this building  had been used as a place of worship by the Baha'is of 'IrAq. 

 In this case it could not be built without the knowledge and permission of the Ministry of the Interior, and actually the case was referred to the above two Ministries. 

The National Spiritual    

 Assembly  is continuing to exert pressure to acquire permission for the erection of the Hall in the way and manner that meets with the blessed wish of our beloved Guardian, who has time and again stressed his wish for the completion of the entire building. In a recent letter dated April 5, 1945 we received  from him the following urgent message: "tAnd now it is incumbent upon you to concentrate your minds upon the construction of the Hall and hold fast in all ways and means until the necessary steps for its erection be made and you are honored in the successful completion of this blessed achievement.'

       AND PRECEPTS              

  CCThe gradual growth and perpetual progress  of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and the corresponding decline and disintegration in the fortunes of the existing religious systems and institutions, are two factors of composition and decomposition which, working at the same time and in contrasting directions, have given the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah an opportunity to apply and put into practice the Laws and Ordinances of the Most Holy Book. 

The National Spiritual    

 Assembly  has stressed upon the Baha'is the necessity of applying the Laws revealed in the tKidb-.i-Aqdas' especially in regard to marriage, and open declaration of the Faith on the part of the believers in connection with legal transactions and official business. Moreover the National Spiritual Assembly in order to acquaint the believers with the spirit of the Laws and Ordinances of the Most Holy Book has formed study classes for teaching this subject and made it a matter of discussion and study in the Nineteen-day  Feasts. 

 It has also advised the local spiritual assemblies to watch the execution of the Laws in their entirety by the friends, and to penalize those who transgress them. 

 "In conclusion it should be said that the refusal of the Government to recognize the Baha'i marriage certificates has caused much trouble to the friends of 'IrAq. This problem we believe will continue to be a source of trouble until the Government recognizes the independent status of the Baha'i Faith and gives the National 

Spiritual Assemblies      

 the permission of executing the Baha'i Laws and Ordinances enshrined in the New 

World Order."

  Part of its area overrun by hostile armies, undergoing a great historical change in its political alignment, India, a continent of races and peoples within itself, has witnessed vigorous development of its Baha'i community.  The National Spiritual Assembly has recapitulated a very extensive record in a few words: —  The Centenary 

Convention                 

  "Better administration, unity, consolidation of the newly established assemblies; the training of Baha'i children and youth; the need of a Baha'i school; a printing press; the need of literature; a magazine in English; a 

Teachers' Training Class;  

 the passage of the Baha'i Laws in the legislature; a better structure for the National Haziratu'1-Quds; greater individual effort in teaching; development of the Summer School; the drawing up of a 3 — , 4, or 9-Year Plan; application for land for a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar; the provision  of a GulastAn wherever there are Baha'is; training in Baha'i administration; greater supervision over the newer L.S.A.s; sending of teachers to Ceylon; the need on the part of the National members to travel and see into all affairs — these were the subjects  discussed at the Convention. 
                           
Twenty-Five New Assemblies 

 CCJ~ the field of both pioneering as well as publications we were up against dIfficulties. In pioneering, the problem was a natural law — the ebb after the flood. 

 The epistles from the Guardian received during the close of the first century reveal, and were responsible for, the heights which the friends in this country scaled under the impetus, and for the success, of the Six-Year Plan that concluded  with the termination of the first century.  An extract from one of these letters dated October 26, 1943, is given to indicate the measure of the response of the Indian friends to the call of the Guardian. 

 " —  The excellent news you conveyed of the progress of the Faith in so many hitherto virgin territories of India greatly rejoiced the Guardian's heart, and he is proud to ness the manner in which the Indian believers are arising, teaching, and sacrificing for the faith of God. The friends themselves must be astonished at the rapidity with which the devoted pioneers have succeeded in establishing new Spiritual Assemblies; and he hopes that many more souls will, thrilled by these achievements, follow in their footsteps, and thus ensure a truly glorious celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the Cause next May. 

 The eyes of the Baha'i world are being increasingly attracted by the achievements of the Indian friends, and they have the opportunity of crowning their Centenary Celebrations  with a victory outstanding in the records of the ~ah4'is of the East. The Guardian  hopes that in this connection many more Baha'i young people will arise and serve. 

 They have the advantages of health and freedom from family responsibility which are not always enjoyed by older peo-pie,  and they should cooperate to the full with more experienced believers in carrying on the pioneer work of the Cause." There were five assemblies in India at the commencement  of the Plan; there were thirty at its close. The resources of the friends were heavily strained. 

 When a call came for help, there was no response because all those who could respond were already in the field. So, inevitably some of the newly established centers dissolved due to a decrease in their numbers. The first year after the century saw a diminution in the number of our assemblies.  The recession continued up till the Convention of 1945. Some ten centers reverted  to group status. 

 The position was realized by the friends at that session. The flow started, never to ebb again. For on this occasion the friends had gained something which they were first without. 

 That was experience. They had learnt the conditions under which permanent settling could be undertaken. And so the new attempts were undertaken on a new basis."

Mr. Samimi's visit to the centers in India resulted in wide publicity for the Cause as he spoke in public at very many of the places that he visited. A press report of his talk and an interview are given herewith as specimens:

 Mission of Baha'i Faith   

  "The establishment of universal peace and brotherhood, the creation or adoption of an international language as an aid to achieve peace and brotherhood, and the setting up of an international force to maintain world peace — this is the basis and the creed of the Baha'i faith," observed Mr. A. Sarnirni, M.B.E., Head Interpreter to the 

British Embassy  in Tihr~n
(Persia), and Chairman    

 of the East and West Committee —  in an address  to the local pressmen at the Baha'i Hall last evening. 

 "The Baha'i faith, despite its recent origin, had made astounding progress according to Mr. Samimi. 

 It had been embraced and accepted  by 51 races in 78 countries. Its followers,  Mr. Samimi claimed, loved their fellowmen, knew peace of mind and spiritual bliss. Hatred and antagonism were unknown to the Baha'is. They believed in and prac

 "Most of the Baha'i activities were conducted  at present in the U.S.A. without any priests or clergymen, as the Baha'is did not believe in pricstcraft of any sort. 

 "The Baha'is were forbidden from interesting  themselves in politics. They were bound, as Baha'is, to carry out the orders of their Government, irrespective of the fact whether it was tyrannical or benevolent. The Baha'is possessed sturdy faith in their future and recked not their present persecutiOn  at the hands of the fanatic maulvis in the country, concluded Mr. Samimi." — (The Shut Observer, Karachi,

  Samirni of Tihrin addressed a public meeting  in English at the Club House of Model Town, Lahore on Sunday last with Lix Col. Jamal-ud-Din, I.M.S., in the chair. During the course of his address the speaker, who spoke in faultless English observed, that permanent peace could only be established when it was implemented by Divine Power. The prophets who founded the great faiths were the bearers of the Divine Plan which in its essentials never changed. These successive prophets were in reality the true Educators of the human race. 

 "The speaker explained the basic principles of the Baha'i Faith which arose in IMn about a century ago an& which had spread all over the world. Quoting 

Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian

 of the Baha'i Faith, the speaker sMd: tLt there be no misgivings as to the animating purpose of the worldwide Law of Baha'u'llah. Ear from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society,  it seeks to broaden its basis, to remould its institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an ever changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate alliances nor can it undermine essential loyalties. It calls for a larger aspiration than any that has yet animated the human race." —  (The 

Tribune, Lahore)           
          Relief                     

  "The oneness of the Baha'i community is demonstrated in practice throughout the year for whenever there is a Baha'i in distress, the local and national assemblies succor him. 

 On the one hand, Baha'u'llah has enjoined work upon every one and on the other has bidden those responsible for the administration of the spiritual affairs of the community to see that no one is in want. Thus, whenever a Baha'i is no longer able to work and in financial straits, the spiritual assembly of the locality where he resides is bound to support him, and if their financial conditions prevent them from rendering him assistance it is the duty of the N.S.A. to help. This principle has been in practice in this country and the community has seen that distress among their less fortunate brethren has been relieved and their sufferings mitigated as far as possible.

     Personal Status           

  "The Baha'i Laws regarding personal status are being increasingly applied and enforced.  It is not very strange that those who newly embrace the Cause feel somewhat queer when they have to change habits to which they have been accustomed for ages but for those who grasp the truth of these Words of Baha'u'llah, the transition is easy. He says: tTrue liberty consisteth in man s submission unto My commandments, little as ye know it. Were men to observe that which we have sent down unto them from the Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty, attain unto perfect liberty. 

 Happy is the man that hath apprehended the Purpose  of God in whatever He bath revealed from the Heaven of His Will, that pervadeth all created things. Say: The liberty that profiteth you is to be found now here except in complete servitude unto God, the Eternal Truth. 

 'Who so hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven.' The friends are trying to adopt all the commandments which the laws of their country permit and the N.S.A. is also endeavoring to get the Baha'i Laws recognized by the Government. The local communities are striving to secure a plot of ground to serve as their Gu1ast~n (literally flower garden, meaning a burial ground) to be enabled to carry out the instructions of Baha'u'llah with regard to burial of the dead. 
                          
      Baha'i School             

 ttTh Baha'i Summer School was held this year in Karachi from October 16th to 31st, both days inclusive. Among the att~ndants Quetta was strongly represented while friends also came from Surat, Bombay, Poona, Hyderabad (Sind), Baha'u'llah and Lahore. Quite a large number attended the school from Karachi. The total attendance was about 50. The morning sessions were held every day from 10 1  p.m. and evening sessions from 4 7  p.m. except on Sundays, when the School remained closed. 20th October  being the Birthday of the Bab, the School remained closed. On 30th October a written test was held and a Feast was given on the 31st of October. 

 ~tE1evcn lessons on Aqdas and BayAn were given by Mr. M. H. Ilmi and each Lesson Lasted for an hour. 

 ttNine lessons on the History of the Baha'i Faith, six lessons on the Twelve 

Baha'i Basic Principles   

 and three lessons on the Administrative  Order of the Baha Faith were given by Mr. N. Ak1~tar-Khawari. 

 Ten lessons  on the Methods of Teaching with special reference to Indian conditions were given by Prof. Pritam Singli. Both the morning and the evening sessions began with Prayers and Reading from the Scriptures and between  the lessons there was a recess of half an hour. 

 "Special features of this year's Summer School were the taking of notes of each lesson  by the attendants and then taking a test which was very satisfactory. 

The Summer School Committee

 decided to present a copy of Munajat-i-'Abdu'1-Bah4 to every one who had attended the School and this was done on 31st October at the time of the reast.

  most of the Assembly's requests have been promptly met by a majority of the centers; most of them have shown eagerness to cooperate  in the execution of the plans for the progress of the Cause; with more or less vigor they have carried forward the work of Teaching; some have displayed great initiative and originality in presenting the Faith to the public on every opportunity they could get; some of them have followed up such work by establishing study groups to which they have invited receptive and spiritual  inquirers; they have observed Baha'i feasts and anniversaries; they have regularly held the 19-Day feasts; they are endeavoring with all their might and within the limits imposed by the law to pUt the Baha'i laws into practice; they have infused into their youth a zeal and generated in them a devotion  to shoulder the responsibilities they will tomorrow have to assume in a larger measure; they have whenever requested undertaken in behalf of the N.S.A. the publication of Baha'i literature; they have organized their local libraries; in short, they have demonstrated in a practical manner the working of Baha'i administration in their centers. 

     NEWS FROM BURMA           

  CrAt this date of writing (the first week of August, 1945) we have not yet received confirmation of news regarding the 

Baha'is at Burma. Immediately

 after communication with that country was restored, the N.S.A. received this cable from the Guardian: 'Anxious news dearly beloved 

Baha'i friends Mandalay   
Rangoon particularly      

Siyyid Mustaf 62 This     

 was received on the 5th May 1945, considered by the N.S.A. on the 6th May, and immediate action taken to secure some definite knowledge of the Burmese friends. 

 Four or five different agencies, governmental and otherwise, were approached through correspondence for the desired information  but having failed for a fortnight to ascertain anything about them, our N.S.A. resolved at its next session to depute someone  to go in• person to Burma and get this knowledge. Dr. Lukmani, the Chairman, of the N.S.A., offered to go, and set out about the end of May. He was not allowed to proceed  beyond Chittagong, on the Burma border, however, and the oniy information he could get from there was that the Upper Burma friends were safe. This news, transmitted  to the Guardian by cable, brought this reply: joyous gratitude safety dear Burmese friends. 

 Convey assurance loving remembrance shrines.' After a while these further items of information filtered through but none of them has up to this time been confirmed: — 1.  Our beloved brother, Siyyid Mu~;af A Rftmi, had been killed at 'Thingagyun by local men. 

 2.  Another friend, Mr. 'Aziz Abmad, had been killed at Kawlin by the 

Japanese.                 
3.  The Baha'is of Rangoon 

 and Mandalay had mostly taken refuge at Daidanaw when the Japanese invaded the country. 

4.  The Baha'is in Upper  

 Burma were safe, though destitute. 

 5.  Mr. Khudabux of Kawlin and Siyyid Ab-did  Husayn $hir~zi of Rangoon who had been in affluent circumstances were now in a distressing plight. 

6.  The J-laziratu'1-Quds 

 at Rangoon and Mandalay had both been destroyed. 

 "We cabled the news contained in items 1, 2 and 6 to the Guardian on 7th July and received this reply: tHearts grief stricken passing supreme concourse distinguished pioneer Faith Baha'u'llah dearly beloved staunch high minded noble soul Siyyid Mu~;afd.

Faith."                   
                          
AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND 

  The most important event in the current history of the Baha'i community has been the acquisition of a building to serve as the national Baha'i headquarters, or Ilatatu'l-Quds. 

 This undertaking was initiated and blessed by a contribution made by the Guardian of the Faith in 1943, followed by donations given by the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, Persia, 'IrAq, India and Burma, and also by an individual Baha'i of Persia. These contributions amounted to a total of over six-thousand  five hundred pounds sterling. 
    The property located at   

2 Lang Road, Centennial   

 Park, Sydney, was purchased, and the secretariat established there before the end of 1944. It is thus described in the report made by the National Assembly: The building  purchased for the T)Ia?Aratu'1-Quds is a sixteen room, two story residence facing the entrance gates to Centennial Park, a public reserve of 600 acres. The entrance is good and the arrangement of the rooms excellent for our purpose. Double doors open from the large reception room into a small library and from the library into a large lecture room. When all the doors of these three adjoining rooms are open the effect is of dignified spaciousness. 

 Mitch time and energy were devoted by the N.S.A. members and friends in Sydney to preparing the premises for occupation. Mrs. E. M. Axford personally directed and supervised alterations,  furnishing and the interior decorating which was necessary. Despite wartime restrictions and shortages which hampered the work on every hand the Secretariat was established in the building by the end of 1944. After much sorting and packing the Secretary and Treasurer for ten years, Miss Hilda Brooks and Mrs. Silver Jackman ire-spectively, spectively, of Adelaide, South Australia, finally despatched all the N.S.A. files, books and belongings to the new Headquarters in Sydney. Miss Brooks, who had also been Keeper of the Archives, reverently carried the Precious Relic, Lock of Baha'u'llah's hair, pen cases and pens which had belonged to 'Abdu'l-Baha, framed specimen of 'Ab-du'1  — Baha'is handwriting and various gifts from the Guardian, to Sydney in her personal luggage. 

 These former officers of the N.S.A. had conducted all the clerical work in their own homes — it was therefore a great joy to them to know that in future N.S.A. officers would enjoy the convenience and dignity of perfectly appointed and equipped offices, thus enabling the clerical work to be accomplished with greater ease and efficiency. 

 In the rows of files and office equipment at Headquarters they see the fulfilment of their dreams. The new Secretary, Mrs. Dive, now resides in the building. 

 The Treasurer, Mr. N. Walker lives in Sydney. 

 Social functions are held at the Headquarters  and both local and National teaching work is carried out there. Many inquirers have called to ask about the Baha'i Faith. The name tCHaziratu~1.Quds~~ has brought forth many queries as to its meaning thus providing  the believers with opportunities to explain  and expound the 

Teachings.                

 Significant steps have also been taken in the proclamation of the Faith. 

 That the teaching work has been influential, and the community has become firmly established, is attested by the degree to which the Baha'i Faith has become a public symbol of a new spirit in religion. 

 On the one hand its broad principles and its freedom from race prejudice  was noted by the Rev. C. W. Chandler in the Auckland Star of March 18, 1944, while its challenge to the former dispensations has been pointed out by a missionary in an article published in the Adelaide Church Guardian. 

 The teaching activities carried on during the two years covered by this survey has been summarized in the Assembly's report. 

 Owing to the war, it has not been possible to increase the tempo of our teaching efforts as we had planned. 

 The housing shortage brought about by the necessities of war (cessation of building and. increase of city

  populations, through the creation of war industries) makes it extremely difficult for wouldbe settlers to find accommodation if they leave their homes to go to new areas. Travel restrictions have prevented the hoped-for  organization of Interstate teaching tours by believers able to give public lectures. 1-lowever the believers have concentrated in their home centers and States and there is not one believer who has not helped in the great cooperative effort called for by the N.S.A. in 1943 and inspired by donations amounting to £87245.0, from the beloved Guardian for the financing of the teaching work. 

 Many of the friends conduct meetings  in their own homes and these have proved very popular and successful, the social atmosphere and the informality of the general  discussions being very attractive to inquirers.  A new Assembly has been formed at Caringbah, New South Wales, twenty miles from Sydney as a result of the regular visits by Mrs. Mariette Bolton. 

 This indefatigable  worker has also formed study groups at Wollongong and Goulburn and interested some people at Canberra. 

 Mr. and Mis. Dobbins have done fine work at Albert Park, a suburb of Adelaide, 

South Australia. Regular   

 meetings are held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone. Six new members have been enrolled as a result of the afternoon and evening home meetings conducted by Mr. and Mrs. Dobbins at Albert  Park. 

 Regular meetings are also conducted by Mr. and Mrs. Fitzner in their home at Joslin, another suburb of Adelaide; six new members  have also been enrolled as a result of their meetings. 
    As settler to Port Elliot, 

South Australia, Miss      

 K. Harcus is doing valuable work. Speakers at public meetings arranged by 

Miss Harcus were Miss      
Hilda Brooks and Mr.       

 H. Fitzner. In Sydney, Adelaide and Hobart weekly meetings provide the opportunity for presenting the Cause publicly, special lectures  are advertised in the press and every effort made to attract large audiences.. 

 In Auckland, New Zealand, teaching was given a big boost by the Centennial celebrations;  activity has been greater than in any previous year. 

 The Auckland friends arc deeply indcbted to the indefatigable efforts and infectious enthusiasm of Sgt. Alvin Blum, an American Baha'i of the U.S. Army Medical Corps. 

 Sgt. Blurn spoke on the platform  of many organizations and in private homes as well as at the regular Baha'i meetings  held at the Fabian Club rooms where he was the principal speaker. In Auckland City he spoke to the following 

: — Astrology Group, Women's 
Progress Club, Christian Spiritualist
Church, Y.W.C.A., Chinese  

New Zealand Society, Crusade

 for Social Justice, Rationalist Association, Junior and Senior Chambers of Commerce, 

People's University, Higher

 Thought Temple and the Quest Club. To some of these groups and organizations he was invited to speak more than once on various aspects of the Baha'i Faith. He also gave talks at Howick, an outlying seaside  suburb. 

 Outside Auckland lectures were given at Whangarei by Sgt. Blurn and Mrs. Dulcie Dive and by Mrs. Dive in the Hawkes flay area, Napier, Havelock north and Hastings. 

 The Faith has had more publicity in Auckland than ever before. This has keen achieved through the Centenary celebrations, the press and cinema advertisements of lectures, socials, lantern slides and occasional articles in commercial magazines. 
                           
Youth Groups:              

  The membership of youth groups in Australia and New Zealand has fluctuated greatly and progress has not been maintained. There is however, a small nucleus of Baha'i Youth in each center which we know will be the starting point for great progress after the war. The 10th Baha'i World Youth Day was celebrated with success and enthusiasm in Adelaide, Sydney, Hobart and Yerrinbool. 
                           
Yerrinbool Summer School:  

  Summer School sessions have been held at ccBolton Place," Yerrinbool, in January and June of each year. The N.S.A. has appointed a committee to take over the entire management of the school. Mr. and Mrs. Bolton have gladly consented to this arrangement and have placed their home ttBolton Place" under the direction of the committee during the school periods.

 The Herald of the South Committee  decided to have several hundred copies of the magazine article printed in pamphlet form for free distribution by the believers. Mr. Gurney began his attack with —  CCDuring this year that I have been at home in Australia on furlough after eight years' work as a missionary of the 

Church Missionary Society  

 in IrAn (Persia), I have been astonished and very worried to see the way in which the faith known as the Baha'i Faith is being propagated, and the way this religion is spreading in little groups in our parishes in all the cities of 

Australia."                

  In  conclusion he wrote: —  ttTh Baha'is I have met in Australia seem earnest and sincere people, and are a real menace because they seem to preach a better and more united and reformed sort of Christian  idealism." 

 The Baha'i statement prepared in reply answers each of the arguments and contentions  advanced by the missionary. 

  A REPLY To REV. H. C. GURNEY C.M.S.    MISSIONARY IN PERSIA 

     The Baha'is of Adelaide  

 have read with painful dismay, the article by the Rev. H. C. Gurney, published in the April and May issues  of the Adelaide Church Guardian, and entitled "Bald'ism — a 

Menace to Christianity    
in Australia."             

 In the first portion of his article the Rev. Gurney has incorrectly outlined the origin of the Baha'i Movement, and in the second instalment has strayed still farther from the truth in his statements concerning the aims of the Faith and the actions of its adherents, and has lost his sense of fair play and justice altogether. 

 The Rev. Gurney, as a Britisher and also as a follower of Jesus Christ, will, the Adelaide Baha'is are sure, be ready to allow them to state their case, and to correct those impressions which will otherwise cause many readers to have wrong ideas of the Baha'i Faith. 

 Firstly, then, the title itself — ttlBahA'isrn — a Menace to Christianity in Australia," is completely misleading. The Baha'i Faith is not an rrIsM,~) but is a universal religion in the broadest and fullest sense; and far from being a "menace to Christianity," it acknowledges  Christianity as the greatest world religion up to the 19th Century, and looks upon itself as the culminating chapter, as it were, in the teachings of Christ; that is, the fulfilment of His prophecies, and indeed the logical outcome and consummation of all the great world religions. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha, son of the Prophet Bah4'-u  'lUli, has written: t~The Baha'i Message is a call to religious unity, and not an invitation to a new religion,  not a new path to immortality, God forbid! It is the ancient pah cleared of the debris of imaginations and superstitions of men, of the debris of strife and misunderstanding, and is again made a clear path to the sincere seeker that he may enter therein an assurance, and find that the Word of God is One Word though the speakers were many." 

 'With regard to the article itself, the Rev. Gurney accuses the Baha'is of Persia of showing hatred, opposition and fanaticism towards the Christians, but this is in direct opposition to the teachings of Baha'u'llah, Who has instructed His followers to ~tconsort with the people of all religions with joy and gladness." 

 Baha'is, in whatever land they may dwell have no wish to speak ill of any religion or religions body; but only to give praise to them for the work which they have accomplished in the past, which has indeed been truly colossal; yet they desire also to stress the point that religions, like everything else in this world, must obey the universal law of change. 

 Religion must be fluid, not static, for that which is static is moribund, and religion, to be alive, must forever progress. 

 That is not to say that the teachings of


<p71>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIVITIES             71

  Jesus Christ were not perfect in themselves; but Baha'is believe that a Messenger of God will only teach so much as the people of His day are capable of assimilating in their then state of mental and spiritual development. 

 The teaching of Baha'u'llah is the same as that of Jesus in its fundamental reality, just as the lessons taught in the High School and University are basically the same as those of the Primary School; they differ oniy in their degree of complexity and advancement. 

 Jesus built His teachings around the word "Lovn," and Baha'u'llah has built His around the word "UNITY," for each Prophet brings His individual, special lesson to humanity. 

 Jesus could have taught the iesson of UNITY, but. 

 of what avail would it have been to a world yet undiscovered in full, with only the poorest means of communication,  and with people having very little knowledge of their brothers in other lands? 

 Today, men realize as never before that UNITY is needed more than anything else. Mr. Anthony Eden, speaking at the San Francisco 

Conference, said: "The     

 world today  is one large city and our countries are its several parishes." 

 Does not this show the need for unity, and for religious unity above all else? 

 How, otherwise, can the apparently insolvable problems of the Moslem and Buddhist,  Christian and Jew, not to mention the hundreds of sects within the religious themselves be solved? Only a great world religion can fuse and weld mankind into one universal whole. 

 What other hope is there for humanity? At the San 

Francisco Conference       

 the Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, speaking on behalf of his Government, said: CCWe are prepared to yield, if necessary, part of our sovereignty to the New International Organization,  in the interests of collective security."  So must each individual religion be prepared to yield a part of its own exclusive claims for the sake of world unity? 

 The Rev. Gurney expresses his anxiety at the ignorance of the clergy regarding the Baha'i Faith. Surely all those who eater the Church should make a study of 

Comparative Religions.     

 No book on this subject is complete  without some mention of the Baha'i Faith. 

 Three of the best known books on Comparative Religion are those written by Dr. J. Estlin Carpenter, Mr. A. W. Martin, and Rev. J. Tyssul Davis. Each of these writers speaks of the Baha'i Faith with unbiassed  sympathy. 

 In his synopsis of the history of the Baha'i Movement, the Rev. Gurney shows that his knowledge fails in several details, e.g., that the Bib had two sons; that Baha'u'llah was the son of the BTh, that Baha'u'llah was exiled because of an attempt on the life of the SlaTh of Persia; that the Baha'is have borrowed any idea which has appealed to them in any other religion, etc. — all of which statements are without foundation. 

 Baha'u'llah  was completely exonerated from haying had anything to do with the attempt on the ShAh's life and was exiled to BaghdAd because the Moslem priests were afraid of the effect of His teachings upon the populace. As for Baha'is borrowing ideas from other religions, this suggests that Baha'is have manufactured their own faith, whereas they simply try to practise the laws and ordinances laid down by Baha'u'llah and are not responsible  for the introduction of anything into the Faith. 

 The Mb had only one son, who died in infancy, and Baha'u'llah was the son of a Persian prince. 

     The Faith of Baha'u'llah    

 is a universal one, and so must of necessity gather together the threads of all the great ~'or1d religions because  it contains the fundamental reality of all religions; because it is the latest chapter in the series of God's purpose for mankind, as revealed through His Prophets, from age to age. 

 Thus the Rev. Gurney arrives at the conclusion  that ttBahA'is are Christians when in Christian society, Moslems when among Moslems, etc." By this he suggests that Baha'is are not true to their faith; but the facts behind  all this are that Baha'is are taught to look for the good in evetything and to show love and brotherhood to all men of whatever religion. 

 Baha'u'llah has written: ctReligion must be the cause of unity." If religion brings dis~ension and disagreement, then it were better to have no religion at all. 

 It is true that Baha'is do make a distinction between spiritual teachings that are basic and eternal and those which are merely


<p72>
72              THE BAHA'! WORLD

  temporal and subordinate to the exigencies of the time. But Jesus Himself made this distinction, changing the temporal laws with regard to divorce and the keeping of the Sabbath day. Indeed, this was one of the main charges which the Jewish priests brought against Him. Yet He declared, "I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it." He clearly proves that certain laws must change with the times, but the great eternal laws of God, such as the Law of Love, are immutable. 

 We ourselves are living at a time when the temporal laws dealing with marriage, divorce, and illegitimacy are being altered to suit the needs of today. But the Golden Rule, which has been given to men by every Prophet right through the ages, still stands and will stand for all time. It is the universal Law of Love towards God and our neighbor, which must stand for all time unalterable. 

 The Rev. Gurney is again at fault when he says that Baha'is do not believe in Christ's promise of the coming of the Holy 

Spirit. Do Christians      

 really believe in His promise themselves? If so, why should they feel such anger and bitterness towards those who believe that Christ's promise has already been fulfilled? 

 Are not the Christians eagerly awaiting it? Baha'is believe that Baha'u'llah is the same Holy Spirit Who should come "to lead us into all truth," the Father Who would come to visit His vineyard. 

 Continuing in the May issue of the Church Guardian, the Rev. Gurney carries his attack still further and throws all fair criticism and unprejudiced judgment to the winds. He plunges headlong into wild statements, which have no vestige of truth. He declares that there is not an original teaching among the principles laid down by Baha'u'llah The following list will prove how false such a statement is: —  Among the principles laid down by Baha'u'llah  are: — 

  (1) Independent Investigation
of the Truth.              

     (2) The Basis of All Religion
Is One.                    
     (3)     Religion and Science
Must Go Hand in Hand.      
     (4)     Equality of the Sexes.

     (5)     Universal Free Education.

 (6) An International Language, an International  Coinage, and am International Script. 

    (7)     A World Parliament 
and a World Federation.    

 What other Prophet has given these teachings to the world? 

 The Rev. Gurney then declares that Baha'is have no idea how these principles are to be put into effect. 

 But on the contrary, Baha'u'llah has left a detailed scheme for the economic security of the world. 

 Baha'is are next accused of ignoring the Cross of Christ. Yet there are no people on earth who can appreciate the sufferings of Christ more than the Baha'is, who know of the agonies endured by Baha'u'llah and the twenty thousand martyrs to His Cause in Persia, from the vivid and terrifying descriptions  given by eye — witnesses. 

 "Few prayers are enjoined," is another misleading statement, for Baha'u'llah's book, "Prayers and Meditations," is a prayer-book containing one hundred and eighty-four prayers for every occasion, every one written by the Manifestation of God Himself, whereas the Church of England Prayer Book, although containing many beautiful prayers, includes only one given by Jesus Himself. The Baha'is have also obligatory prayers, which are said daily. Again, the Baha'i Faith does not prohibit divorce, but on the contrary it makes divorce easier and marriage more difficult. 

 "The Baha'i Cause in Persia," says the Rev. Gurney, "is a subtle and partly secret society." This is completely refuted by the fact that on 10th May, 1925, in the Appellate 

Religious Court of Bab    

 in Upper Egypt, the verdict was given that the Baha'i Faith is to be regarded as a distinct religion, wholly independent of the religious systems that have preceded it. "The Baha'i Faith is a new religion, entirely independent, with beliefs, principles and laws of its own, which differ from and are utterly in conflict with the beliefs, principles and laws of Islam," was the formal declaration of that Court. Trans-. lated into several languages, circulated among Baha'i communities in East and WTest, this verdict gradually paved the way for the initiation  of negotiations between the elected representatives of these communities and the


<p73>
CURRENT BAHA'I ACTIYITITS             73

  civil authorities in Egypt, in the Holy Land, in Persia, and even in the United States of America, for the purpose of securing the official recognition by these authorities of the Fifth as an independent religion. 

 The statement that the Persian Baha'is, though dealing well with their brothers in the Faith, are quite unscrupulous in their dealings with nonbelievers, is a mischievous and false accusation. This is followed by the remark that "Baha'is are trained to argue with members of other religions," and that their arguments cCare clever and subtle enough to upset the ideas of all but the well-trained theologian." The truth is exactly the opposite, for Baha'is are forbidden to argue on the grounds that argument causes disunity,  whereas the Baha'i Cause is designed to draw all men together in love and harmony. 

 "Baha'is are sent specially to confuse and break up Christian meetings," is another malicious accusation. 

 "They worm their way into Christian meetings and will even proceed  as far as baptism unless detected beforehand." 

 This is mere childishness, for what object could any Baha'i have in being bap-tised  as a Christian? 

 And again, "They do all this with the object of breaking up the Church from within." The following words of Baha'u'llah show clearly enough that no Baha'i may lawfully indulge in any such misconduct. 

 "Beware lest ye contend with anyone, nay rather strive to make him aware of the truth with kindly manner and most convincing exhortation     Dispute not with anyone concerning the things of this world and its affairs, for God hath abandoned them to such as have set their affection upon them." The Christians may be assured that the Baha'is have never for one instant entertained such an idea, even if it were possible to do this. The ideals of the Baha'i Faith are not destructive, but constructive and cooperative. Baha'is attend the church service or any other religious meeting with the sole object of worshipping God, Who is the same God, in whatever temple He may be worshipped. 
    Baha'is do indeed CCI.    

 to be Christians,"  for they pay reverence to Jesus the Christ, the Divine Son of God, and the fact that they believe in the fulfilment of 

His                        

 promise to come again, does not detract one iota from the love and adoration which they humbly offer to Him. 

 The Rev. Gurney continues: tClts appeal, I think, can only be explained by the claim to unite all religions in one, and the appeal to the principles of peace and brotherhood."  Surely this should cause no Lurprise or apprehension to a Christian, whose Master was heralded into the world with the proclamation of "Peace on earth, good will to all men.~~ The Rev. Gurney appeals to the Church of England clergy to make themselves f a-miliar  with the Baha'i teachings. The Baha'is of Adelaide heartily endorse this appeal. It is a vast claim that Baha'u'llah has made and so mighty a Revelation de —  mands from the sincere seeker, deep and earnest study, and an open mind free from prejudice. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha says: ttBeware of prc~udice; light is good in whatsoever lamp it is burning.  A rose is beautiful in whatsoever garden it may bloom. A star has the same radiance whether it shines from the East or from the West." 
                           
SGT. ALVIN BLUM IN NEW     
ZEALAND                    

  Grateful comment and appreciation for the outstanding teaching services of Alvin Blum, of the United States Army Medical Corps, stationed for many months in New Zealand, is expressed on several occasions in the pages of the Baha'i Quarterly, issued by the National Spiritual Assembly of 

Australia  and New Zealand.

 An excerpt from the JuLy, 1945, issue of the Quarterly touches upon some of Sgt. 

 Blum's teaching activities before he was transferred to the Philippine Islands. 
         "Teaching in the Auckland

 Sgt. Alvin Blum of the U.S. Army Medical Corps has been mainly responsible for presenting  the Message of Baha'u'llah to many and varied organizations, groups and meetings. 

 He did not confine his activities to public lecture rooms; he also spoke in private homes to audiences ranging from one to thirty persons. His main lectures were given to the following organizations in Auckland City: — Astrology

To many of these. groups and organizations he has been invited to speak more than once on various aspects of the Baha'i Faith. These lectures are exclusive of the regular monthly meetings held at the Fabian Club rooms, where he was a principal speaker. 

 He also gave talks at Howick, an outlying seaside suburb. We sincerely offcr our heartfelt thanks to God for sending Sgt. Alvin Blum to our country. 

 "Sgt. Blum gave a final lecture at the Fabian Club rooms on 15th October, 1944. Over fifty people received special invitations, the majority of whom attended. 

 Lectures were given at Whangarci (outside the Auckland  Area) on the 24th and 25th of July.

  REV. C. W. CHANDLER 

IN The Auckland Star       
                           
    "He Hath Made of One Blood 
All The Nations            

  Following the publication in this column of a resume of the life of "George 

Washington  Carver," I    

 have received a letter from an American negro living in St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.         By some means or other he must have got hold of the Star of 8/1/43. 

 His letter betrays something of his broad human sympathy and Christian understanding. 

 He is an attorney, his age is just over 60, and his name is Louis G. Gregory. 

  B~ REV. C. W. CHANDLER 'tThe founders of all the world's great religions," he says, "all believed in and acted upon true brotherhood, and set such examples as inspired the early followers of their respective  faiths to vindicate their love for humanity by heroic deeds of sacrifice and devotion." 

 Color is a very superficial thing, and at heart all sincere seekers after truth are actuated  by one Spirit, which is the Holy Spirit of God. 

 Gregory, my Negro correspondent, continues: !!Th Golden Rule is in all religions. 

 The Holy Spirit is the one Reality. It is the Power which creates and gives life to mankind and to all besides. The early Christians reflected the idealism and sacrifice of the Exalted Christ, but all religions, when remote from the time of their establishment, show a tendency unmistakable to lapse into forms which lack suhstance, and to substitute  dogmas and ceremonials for loving kindness and altruistic deeds." 
                           
      Ming Tse Again             

  Today I also received a letter from Ming Tse, my Chinese friend, with whom many of you are already acquainted. As another of these ~t1d" men he sees the failure of institutional religion. Quoting from a source unknown to me, he says: ttNearly half way through the 20th century the nations of the West are no longer so confident of their superiority. 

 They seek new gods. Science, which alone had given them that superiority, has turned in their hands, for they have not the wisdom to use it aright. 

 Christianity, which gave to Europe at least the common bond of a spiritual form, has been destroyed by materialism, nationalism and reason, for even their virtues are at war, lacking the guiding Spirit. Christianity has gone — European  civilization is going." 

 Without agreeing that Christianity has gone, I would at least say that institutionally it is in a rapid process of decay. It is just platitudinous and powerless in the face of States organized for destruction. 

 Both this Negro and this Chinese are feeling  as millions are feeling everywhere, namely, that we see more of the shell than of the substance of religion, and that the further we go from our beginnings the deeper lies the pearl beneath the weight of accumulated dogmas, prejudices and misinterpretations. 

 I feel honored in receiving Gregory's letter, for he knew Dr. Carver, the Negro scientist of whom I wrote on the occasion referred to above. His letter confirms my own deep-rooted conviction, that God is revealing Himself today in most unexpected quarters, that as in the days of Our Lord's earthly pilgrimage, He found more faith in

  outcast Samaritans, Roman Centurions, despised publicans and harlots, than He did in recognized religious leaders, so today, the challenge for true Christian living and courageous witness is coming from outside our churches — not exclusively, but in a measure that should humble our pride, and help us to see that the Holy Spirit is far less orthodox than we ourselves are. The Pneuma tou Theos, or Breath of God, does not discriminate, for whoever humbly waits for the Spirit's prompting, be he white, black or brindle, can be sure of a generous response. 
                           
       Baha'u'llah                

  Louis Gregory is a follower of what is known as the Baha'i Faith, which was founded by Baha'u'llah, a Persian, whose son, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was knighted by King George V. "God in His mercy and 'ove," says Gregory, "sends a new prophet or manifestation about every thousand years to renew the spirit of religion, and to give m~nkind new laws in keeping with the needs of the day." I would add that these later recurring manifestations  are not in conflict with anything that has gone before. "The teachings of Baha'u'llah are the light of the age, and the spirit of the century, and are conferring new life upon mankind." 

 In the pre-Christian era we stoned our prophets. 

 Today we oniy ignore them. Who is to say that God did not inspire this Persian Seer with a message for today, and that the Christ Spirit did not dwell in him? 

 Archdcicon Townshend, of County Galway,  Ireland, in his "Heart of the Gospel" (published 1940) says: "How many diflicul —  ties, hitherto insuperable, would disappear if only there could be kindled again in us the fire that burned in the hearts of the early Christians?" 

 He concludes his book with this question: 'tWhat adequate plan of action survives for men to work to, save only that prophetically traced long since by the pen of Baha'u'llah" In the nonracial discrimination of the Baha'i Faith, rather than in the 'White Man's Church in America, wherein ttniggers" are not allowed to worship, has my valued correspondent found a spiritual home. 

 If he has been lost to any branch of the Christian Church, who is to blame? 
                           
 UNITED STATES AND CANADA   

  As in the case of other Baha'i communities,  the believers of North America entered the second Baha'i century with the feeling that a victory had been attained, and that spiritual victory does not end the struggle but prepares the way for greater responsibil-. fry, intensified resistance and weightier tasks. 

    Following the Centenary    

 celebrations, the community at the end of the Seven-Year Plan inaugurated in 1937 counted at least one local Assembly in every State and Province, and an Assembly or active nucleus in each country of Central and South America. The Centenary, indeed, for the first time brought together in worship, consultation and action elected representatives of the Baha'is of the western hemisphere. 

 The two years, 19441946, were characterized  by three motivations: first, the consolidation  of goals already won; second, a bolder public proclamation of the Faith through meetings, radio broadcasts, publicity and selective mailings; and third, a coordination or focussing of different teaching technics  for the more effective conduct of a common national program. 

 The community consciousness reflected two predominant influences specialized to this period: the new degree of understanding of the Faith in its successive epochs and its manifold realities made possible by access to the Guardian's historical survey, "God Passes By"; and the deepening of faith arising from the worldwide tragedy of a war which revealed the inherent lack of peace in all institutions and traditions. 

 These trends and forces appear at least in outline as one tonsiders some facts emphasized  in reports of national committees.

  The Trustees report that

 He also executed a deed of gift transferring the furnishings and equipment of this cottage to the Trustees.

  The Trustees received two deeds, dated May 22, 1944, signed respectively by Elizabeth  James and Elizabeth James as sole surviving executrix of the Last Will and Testament of Julia James, deceased, to lots 13 and 12 in Block D of a certain map entitled ~tsecond map, property of the Phelps estate, Teaneck, New Jersey." 

 The transfer of these two lots to the "Wilhelm Trustee property represents the ful-flulment  of the wishes of the late Arthur James, who purchased the lots many years ago in order to protect the adjoining property  which was the historic site of the memorable Feast given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1912. Similar purchases of other lots by Mr. Walter 

Goodfellow and Mr. Roy     

 C. Wilhelm have already been transferred to the Trustees. This gift now puts the Trustees in possession of 15 lots including Evergreen Cabin, the former National Baha office and the Wilhelm residence and this property will have the one memorial in the United States erected to the memory of our beloved Master. 

          Bosch                      

  On August 1, 1944, John and Louise Bosch, as a further evidence of their continuing  generosity, created a deed of gift, transferring to the Trustees title to two adjoining parcels of land comprising five acres of valuable fruit orchard together with several buildings, situated on the East side of the Redwood 

Highway.                   

 This indenture of trust was signed on the occasion of the 89th birthday of Mr. Bosch and constitutes the first endowment of property  in North America in the second Baha'i Century. 

 Another piece of property adjoining the main tract of the Bosch Trustee property situated along the Redwood Highway was given to the Trustees this past year by Mrs. Amelia E. Collins.

  Legal assistance was given to the Spiritual Assembly of Muskegon to effect its incorporation  so that it could take title to a lot given to the 

Baha'i Temple Unity Corporation 

 many years ago. The abstract of title to Lot 14, Block 10 of the Revised Plat of the City of Muskegon, Muskegon County, Michigan,  made by the Title Department of the Muskegon Abstract Company, with final date of December 18, 1913 was forwarded to the Muskegon Assembly and the title to this property is now vested in that incorporated 

Assembly.                  

 The Trustees are happy to report another generous gift from Mrs. Amelia E. Collins of a lot opposite the Temple on Linden Avenue,  described as

CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMMUNITY

  As we take stock at the end of this first year of the Second Century, we see that a transition is in process, from the conquest of virgin States and Provinces, to the possibility of an unprecedented expansion of teaching on this continent. In the words of the Guardian:     CCA new chapter is now opening, a chapter which ere its termination, must eclipse the most shining victories won so heroically by those who launched the first stage of the Great Plan conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha for the American believers." 

 194445     has been a year of unceasing struggle to hold the spiritual prizes already won. At the same time through the organi —  zation of Baha'i groups, through studies, and the initial steps toward a more effective coordination  of national and regional teaching, the birth of a new momentum is discerned more promising for the growth of the Faith than any past achievement. 

 The magnitude of these continental opportunities is best reflected in the accompanying  table, which compares the status of the Faith at the opening of the Seven-Year Plan, May, 1937, with its status as of March 1, 1945. Eight years of teaching have carried  the American Community from a scattered foothold in half the areas of North America to a rootage in numerous localities of every one, — from 

94 Baha'i communities (Assemblies

 and groups) in 30 areas, to 472 communities in 

60 States, Provinces       

 and Territories, an increase of five times, calling for the most extensive and well-coordinated

  plans to bring to fruition this mighty tree of the 

Administrative Order.      

 To study this table, region by region, is to gain a deep and thrilling conviction of the potentialities of collective teaching. The future is boundless, the victories assured, the influence upon America's destiny a solemn promise if we but carry forward our tasks.

 The reports of the Baha'i elections in Latin-America on April 21st, 1945 brought the heartening news of the formation of eight new Spiritual Assemblies — namely, in La Paz, Bolivia; Contratacion, Colombia; Punta Arenas, Chile; Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican  Republic; Guayaquil, Ecuador; Panama City, Panama; Caracas, Venezuela; and Montevideo, Uruguay. 

 The following cable sent to the Inter-America Committee by the Guardian was received in Wilmette, 

April 3 0th: "Heart-felt

  The Community here lost two valuable members, — Erta Mae Lawrence, who returned to New York in June; and Haig Kevorkian, who pioneered in Guayaquil from April 9th to November 4th. 

 Shirley Warde, the newest pioneer, left Miami on March 5th, 1946, for Buenos Aires, where she is to assist in teaching and spreading  the Faith, and to help the Publishing Committee. Because of her background of experience in radio, Mrs. Warde will give special attention to the developing of radio scripts and programs for the different centers.

 There are now eleven adults and one youth in the Baha'i Community. Arturo Cuellar, one of the most active members, translated and forwarded to the Committee in Buenos Aires tcFoundations of World Unity," and Gwenne Sholtis has published at her own expense an excellent small booklet,  "La Fe 

Baha'i."

Inter-America Committee   
in Wilmette on July 11th. 

 She is home on a visit but plans to return to Rio some time soon. Virginia Orbison arrived in Rio on November 9th, to serve as pioneer. Mary and Edward Bode, also pioneers, arrived  here on January 16th, to remain indefinitely. 

 The Committee is very happy to report the recent formation in Rio, of a group numbering six, — one of these a new believer. 

 Dr. Tomas W. Sanchez Egea, a Baha'i from Montevideo, is the Secretary. The 

Inter-America Committee   

 rejoices that Leonora Armstrong, who has been "holding the fort" so valiantly for all these years, is now being reinforced and assisted by these newly arrived pioneers. 

 Mason Remey, Mr. and Mrs. Sala, Gertrude  Eisenberg, and Shirley Warde have all visited Rio during the past year.

  Gayle Woolson arrived in San Jose on October 31st, remaining there until December  5th, during which time the Salas also visited San Jose. Study classes, radio programs,  and other activities were resumed, but the friends needed the continued assistance of a resident pioneer.

  Dorothy Baker, representing the N.S.A., spent the period from September 21st to November 24th, consulting with the Spiritual Assembly of Mexico City, assisting them in every way possible, and holding spe-cml  classes for the deepening of the knowledge of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. She was greatly assisted by Gayle Woolson, from 

September 21st to October 

 4th, and by Octavio Illescas, who remained for a month after Mrs. Baker's departure from Mexico City. With the assistance of these friends, the Spiritual Assembly in Mexico City estThlished a new center, called a meeting  of the Community to replace the two members who had resigned from the Assembly,  and elected new officers to fill the vacancies.  They also reinstated some former members who had been inactive. 

 The Cause is now firmly established in Mexico City, and a wonderful spirit of unity and harmony prevails. Hascie Cornbleth is awaiting his Mexican permit, to proceed to

 Before leaving Managua, the latter part of August, Dr. Malcolm M. King had succeeded  in registering the Faith with the government, and in obtaining from them the right to teach its tenets in that country. 

 He left a group of eight declared believers. Gayle Woolson was in Managua from October 15th to 3 1st, and Elisabeth Cheney remained there from 

October 27th to January   

 5th. Through the efforts of these two pioneers, the membership  of the group was increased to eighteen.  The Committee is especially happy to report that this group is continuing with their studies of "Administration," and are eagerly anticipating the formation of their Spiritual 

Assembly in April.

  The most important event during the year in Panama was the recent Baha'i Latin-American  Congress, from January 2 1st to the 25th, at which ten countries of Latin America were represented by native believers,  and in which seven of the pioneers participated. 

 All visitors from the various countries took some part in the program, with an attendance at the evening meetings of from forty-seven to one hundred persons. There were classes each morning on ccGod Passes By," ctAdministration~3 and teaching methods in Latin America; and each evening there were Public Talks on various tenets of the Faith, the last meeting held in the large hail of the Inter-American 

University.               

 This Conference is being reported in detail  in the special Spanish Bulletin and in Baha'i News, but the Inter-America Committee wishes to report that it was truly an historic occasion, surpassing the highest expectations of everyone. The Committee deeply appreciates all the devoted efforts,

 Gayle Woolson was in Panama from February 5th to the 26th, assisting the Spiritual Assembly in the Baha'i activities and teaching work, and contributing greatly to the Publishing and Bulletin Committee work and to the arrangements for the Conference. 

 Cora Oliver visited the United States and met with the Inter-America Committee when she passed through Wilmette in July 1945.

  tion of Baha'u'llah, The 

Dawn of a New Era, Baha'i  
Prayers.                   

 All of these books have now been published  in quantity, and currently there is on hand in this distributing center the following Baha literature in Spanish: Baha'u'llah and the New Era, Prayers, Dispensation, Princi-pies, 

World Religion, Baha'i     

 Faith, Dawn of a New Era, and The Baha'i Peace Plan (this last named is a condensation of the pamphlet which was published in San Francisco  during the United Nations Conference, and brought out in Spanish for special use in connection with the Public Talks of the Itinerant Teachers). 

  The Committee in Buenos    

 Aires is currently  publishing the following: Wisdom, Sdme Answered Questions, a revised edition of Procedure, and a Study Outline, especially  compiled for 

Latin America.             
                           
    AMERICAN ARCHIVES          

  The Guardian, himself, made a second gift of the Hair of the Bib, which was received  early in July. This gift was started on its way from Haifa in January, 1944, in the hands of Dr. Asgarzadeh several months after the locket containing the first gift of the Bab's Hair had been mailed to the National  Spiritual Assembly, but before its return  to Haifa as the result of a mail plane accident. This first gift was received, however, in time to be displayed with the Portrait  of the Bab at the Centenary. 

 Among other relics received during the year were a locket containing Hair of Baha'u'llah  and a part of a handkerchief which He used; a rosary, a lock of hair, three handkerchiefs  and an autographed photograph of 'Abdu'l-Baha; a blouse and a scarf worn by the

   The College Speakers Bureau

 has undertaken  a second aspect of its work — contacting colleges through pamphlet literature. This aspect was not developed last year because  of work involved in getting the Bureau  first organized. 

 A special reprint of Dr. R. F. Piper's ccWays to Wholeness" was prepared for the Bureau, and over 200 copies were mailed out with a personal letter to educators. A special list was drawn up for this purpose. The response was very gratifying, and some of the replies received contained  such statements as: '~The Baha'i teachings are both of special timeliness for our generation and of eternal value for all time.~~ The record of college teaching this year may be summed up thus: Dr.

Morris Brown College       

 (as-sembly),  Fayetteville (N.C.) Teachers College (assembly), B. E. Smith High School (assembly). 

 Not all reports of chapel talks contained notations on the number of students and faculty present, but the average attendance was 375 at those college assemblies for which we have a report of attendance. 
                           
LOCAL ASSEMBLY INCORPORATIONS

  The Legal Committee has reported incorporation of seven more local Assemblies during  this two-year period, bringing the total number of incorporated 

Assemblies to 47. The      

 seven are: Birmingham, Alabama; Kansas  City, Missouri; Baltimore, 

Maryland; At-lanti,  Georgia;

 Dayton, Ohio; Muskegon, Michigan; and Denver, Colorado. 
                           
     LIBRARY SERVICE            

  The national committee arranging placement  of Baha'i literature in libraries reported  that books were placed the first of

  the two years in 134 public libraries and 43 college and university libraries; for the second  year the figures were 163 and 130 respectively. 
                          
 VISUAL TEACHING MATERIAL  

  During the winter and spring of 1944 three motion picture films in color were received  from the Guardian. These contained beautiful views of the Shrine, the Monuments  and the gardens on Mt. Carmel; also, of the Shrine and Mansion at Baha'i, the Garden  of RidvTh, and the House of Baha'u'llah in Akka. These films were shown at the Centenary, and in order to make copies available  to the friends, the Committee was instructed  by the National Spiritual Assembly to prepare titles and select scenes to make up a 400 ft. reel. 

 Kodachrome motion pictures were taken during the Centenary Convention, showing both interior and exterior scenes. 

 Selections were made from pictures taken by Victor Alexander and Archie Tichenor, members of the Committee, and by a professional photographer who took the interior scenes, to make up two 400 ft. reels. The titling of these pictures was done by Mr. Tichenor. 

 The Committee has continued to supply sets of Temple slides, 35 mm. size for still projection. The set now consists of 15 Kodachrome  views, and 35 black and white views. Through the Temple Librarian and Sales Committee orders have been filled for approximately  65 sets of these slides during the past three years. 

 They have gone from Palestine to Australia, and from Alaska to the southern tip of Chile. 
                          
     PUBLIC RELATIONS          

  By its nature, this committee represents the first stages of an evolution which is in. tended to strengthen the capacity of the American Baha'i community to act in relation  to current events and current public issues. 

 As peace is the major public issue, the committee laid a basis by recommending the publication of the compilation "Peace a Divine  Creation" in 1943. 

 This year the committee has recommended the reprinting of "Foundations of World Unity," selected talks delivered by the Master in America; and compiled the four peace broadsides which have been mailed to thousands of persons on a national list and have also been distributed by many local Assemblies. 

 There has been a total of 33,000 sets of the four sheets, or 132,000 individual broadsides, printed between  December 1944 and March 15, 1945. 

 Among the references made to the Faith in non-Bah&i publications, the committee has listed the following: The front cover of Wilmette Life for September 6, 1945 reproduced an aerial photo of the House of Worship and the harbor,  with a caption including this reference: 

CCThe world-famed Baha'i  

 remple is seen at the extreme right." 

    In Locomotive Engineer    

 for June, 1945, we find a quotation by 'Abdu'l-Baha set in a box for special emphasis. 

 The army paper, Stars and Stripes, August 11, 

1945, Southern Germany    

 Edition, carries  an aerial view of the House of 

Worship.                  

 The book entitled "An American Dilemma"  refers to the race unity principle of the Faith on page 871, vol. 2. 
    The pamphlet entitled     

"This Is Your America"    

 issued by the CJO Political Action Committee makes a brief reference to the word tCBh~~i~~ A reference to the Bab and to the book by Comte de Gobineau appears in the essay by Matthew Arnold entitled CCA Persian Passion  Play," included in Essays in Criticism, First Series, Macmillan Co., 1930. 

The magazine, Canadian    
Geographical              

 Journal, March, 1944, contains an article on CcSymbolism and the Humanities" by Sylvia King, with three Temple views, one full page. 

 The June, 1945, issue of Flying mentions Point Oboe, the code name assigned to the Baha'i Temple. 

 "Navigational fixes are given from that landmark" in flights from Glen-view to carriers in Lake Michigan. 

 The Pure Oil News of February, 1945, featured the Temple in a three page illus —  trated article. 

 A member of the Board of Missions and Church Extension of the Methodist Church is writing a book on different religions which contains a clear and sympathetic article on the Baha'i Faith.

86               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  An article by Virginia 

Pearson entitled "Those    
Worlds Beyond the Sun"     

 appeared in Mind Digest for November, 1945. The author  relates a subjective experience in which she states that 'Abdu'l-Baha appeared to her in vision many years ago. 

 In Saturday Night, the weekly magazine of Canada, an excellent article about the Cause was published December 8, 1945, using the Toronto Public Meeting as its connection  with current news events. 

 The rotogravure section of the Chicago Sunday Tribune of January 6, 1946, contains  a very attractive view of the Temple taken by a staff photographer. 

 One of the most helpful newspaper references which has ever appeared in this country was the full page, colored photo of the Temple  as illumined during the Centenary cele —  bration with an extensive article, published in the Chicago Sunday Tribune of June 17, 1945. 

 Last June a request was received from the publishers of the World Book Encyclopedia for revision of its statement about the Cause written many years ago. The material was corrected, amplified and brought up to date, and it is hoped that the next edition will use this corrected statement. 

 In August we interested a member of the faculty of a College in Chicago in adding the Baha'i House of Worship to his lectue on the marvels of architecture delivered before  public audiences in many cities. 

    The Travel Bureau of Chicago

 Motor Club from time to time requests a supply of Temple booklets as it distributes copies to members wishing to know about local points of interest. 

 Marshall Field and Co., Chicago department  store, issues a pamphlet entitled "Home Town Tour," which advises the reader to visit the Baha'i Temple. 

    Universal Atlas Cement     

 Co. of New York some time ago took pictures of the Temple and submitted them to Architectural Record, which published a statement on the Temple in its September number. 

 The Concrete Manufacturer, a section of Pit eff Quarry Magazine, carried in its September number an article on the work of John J. Earley, including illustration of the House of Worship. 

Apparently the Atlas Cement

 Co. likewise supplied this material to the publication. 

    The Portland Cement Association

 of Chicago  has prepared an excellent illustrated article  on the Temple for its magazine Architectural Concrete, to appear in an early issue. 

 Redbook Magazine in 1939 carried an article  by Hendrik Willem Van Loon, the his, torian, entitled ttSomewhere a Man Is Sitting,"  which graphically depicts the need of a man of superhuman power who can reconcile  men's spiritual and physical needs and thereby save the modern world from the fate of Babylon or 

Ninevah or Thebes. This    

 clear and enlightened point of view can best be contacted through presentation of a copy of the Guardian's book, ~~God Passes By," and this will be done. 

 GoodWill Magazine of Cleveknd has requested a photograph of the Temple for use as front cover illustration. 

 During the fall and winter of 19431944, many local newspapers published an advertisement  to promote the sale of government bonds in which a picture of the Temple was used to illustrate the theme of religious free-doria, one of the issues of the war. 
    The front cover of WJilinette

Life and Winnetka Talk     

 for September 21 reproduced the new aerial picture of the House of 'Worship on their front cover. 

 The same issue of W/ilnsette Life ran a photograph of a mural painting in a non-Bah4'i home of the village which illustrates Wilmette harbor and the House of Worship. 

 In the dining room of Hotel Orrington, Evanston, one end of the room has been recently  decorated with a mural of Wilmette harbor and the Temple — a beautiful and impressive  view which is attracting much favorable comment. 

 A good friend of the Cause, Mr. Howard S. Ross of Montreal, conducts a department entitled "The Forum" in The Suburban News, a weekly paper published in that city. His column on September 28 contained a very interesting reference to the Centenary celebration. 

     The Chicago Daily Tribune  

 of August 19 ran a half-page photograph of the view from the top of the Tribune tower looking north, and the principal structures visible, including  the Baha'i Temple, are marked by name.

on January 15, 1946.      

 Temple illustrations and Baha literature have been given to the editor of National Architect at his request, for a feature article on the 

Cause.                    

 A notice of Temple meetings and guiding has been placed in a bulletin called the Wet-coiner  which a special organization sends to every family who moves to Wilmette, Evanston,  Highland Park, Winnetka, Glencoe and Kenilworth. This bulletin is issued annually,  and contains data and information useful to new residents in the area. 

 A passage from words of the Guardian was quoted in Motive of May, 1945, the magazine of the Methodist 

Student Movement.        

 Temple pictures have been given to Ca-noco  Travel 

Bureau, Continental Oil   

 Co., for reproduction in their bulletin for tourists. 

 A misleading statement about the Cause was published in Bergen County Panorama, and the correction of this has been taken up with the civil authorities who sponsored the publication. 

     My Home Town, the Souyenir

 of Chicago issued for Service Men and Women, carries an illustration of the Temple as central feature  of its page of illustrations of churches. 

 The book entitled Days With Walt Whit —  man, by Edward Carpenter, contains a ref er-ence  to the Cause. 

 There are also Baha'i references in Sunday After the War, by Henry Miller, published by New Directions and in Persian Gulf Command, by Joel Sayre, Random 

House.

 Live magazine of April, 1945. 

 The projects carried out by the committee in 19451946 included: Preparation and distribution of newspaper articles of editorial nature. 

 Printing 20,000 sets of ten postcard size reprints of Baha'i texts to stimulate teaching  activities of individual Baha'is. 

 Printing 50,000 reprints of the color picture of the Temple and Baha'i article which appeared in the Chicago

  A NATIONAL PROGRAM OF     
                          
     PUBLIC MEETINGS           

  The year 194 51946 marked a restoration of a program of public meetings conducted and sponsored by a national committee. This activity was inaugurated by 'Abdu'l-Baha in initiating the series of race unity conferences in 1920. The general theme, "The Price of World Peace Is World Religion," was carried out through a schedule of thirteen meetings. Their programs brought about a close relationship between the national  and the local bodies, and involved contributions  of service by a number of Baha'i agencies. 

 The schedule began with a meeting in Royal York Hotel, Toronto, October 29, 1945, and continued: New 

England Conservatory     

 of Music, Boston, November 16;

 In most other States the existing statutes  have contained provisions under which an incorporated Spiritual Assembly can be authorized to conduct a marriage ceremony. The text of the Act is here cited: —  Be it enacted, etc., as follows: Section 1. Section thirty of chapter two hundred and seven of the General Laws, as most recently amended by section one of chapter two hundred and fourteen of the acts of nineteen hundred and forty-five, is hereby further amended by inserting after the word ttrabbi" in the fourteenth line the words: — , chairman of an incorporated local spiritual assembly of the Baha'is, — so as to read as follows: — Section 30. Upon application  by both of the parties to an intended marriage, when both parties are residents of the commonwealth or both parties are nonresidents, or upon application of the party residing within the commonwealth when one of the parties is a resident and the other a nonresident, a judge of probate or a justice of a district court, or a special judge of probate and insolvency or special justice of a district court, may, after hearing such evidence  as is presented, grant a certificate stating that in his opinion it is expedient that the intended marriage be solemnized without delay. Upon presentation of such a certificate, or, in extraordinary or emergency cases when the death of either party is imminent,  upon the authoritative request of a minister, clergyman, priest, rabbi, chairman of an incorporated local spiritual assembly of the Baha'is or attending physician, the clerk or registrar of the town where the notice  of. intention has been filed shall at once issue the certificate prescribed in section twenty-eight. 

 Section 2. Section thirty-eight of said chapter two hundred and seven, as most recently amended by chapter one hundred and sixty-two of the acts of nineteen hundred and thirty-zwo, is hereby further amended by inserting after the word ttsocieties" in the twenty-fourth line the words: — , and it may be solemnized among the Baha'is by the chairman of an incorporated local spiritual  assembly of the Baha'is according to

TELEGRAM To THE PRESIDENT  
ON PEACE The President, The

 White House, Washington, II. C. It is the prayerful hope of the American Baha'is that your Excellency, chief magistrate of the American nation and symbol of its destiny at this great turning-point in human history, will be spiritually guided and reinforced  to lead the nations and peoples of the world in the inauguration of universal peace. We recall with reverence and devotion the exalted mission upheld for America by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1912 when He traveled from city to city promulgating the principles of universal peace and in the city of Washington  declared: ttM this American democracy be the first nation to establish the foundation of international agreement. 

 May it be the first to upraise the standard of the Most Great Peace and through this nation of democracy may these philanthropic intentions and institutions be spread broadcast throughout the world. Truly this is a great and revered nation. 

 Here liberty has reached its highest degree. The intentions of its people  are most praiseworthy. They are indeed worthy of being the first people to build the tabernacle of the great peace and proclaim the oneness of mankind. I will supplicate Cod for assistance and confirmation in your behalf." May the dire needs of humanity be met by the creation of a new world order through the efforts of the forthcoming conference  in San Francisco under your leader ship.   National Baha'i Assembly, Geor8e 0. Latimer, Chairman 

     Horace Holley, Secretary

      BAPA'i SCHOOLS             

  Since both acquirement of knowledge and the sharing of spiritual truth are obligations laid upon Baha'is, their education is conducted  in homes, local gatherings and under informal conditions too numerous to recount. 

 Formal educational institutions have been begun in the United States, England, Germany, Egypt, Persia, India, and Australia and New 

Zealand. Between 1944      

 and 1946 conditions prevailing in some of these countries, as in Germany, made the conduct of a Baha'i school impossible. In England the difficulty arose from the scarcity of suitable accommodations. 

 In Canada the preliminary work has been done for the institution of a formal school through the conduct of summer  conferences for study and discussion. Canada enters the list of countries having Baha'i schools with the recent announcement that a site has been found in the Laurentian area of Quebec and that land and farm buildings  have been acquired for donation to the Ba1A'i community of Canada when its National Assembly is formed. 

 Information has been received concerning school activities maintained in Australia, Germany,  Canada and the United States, in acidi —  don to the brief references to schools found in the preceding series of national surveys. 

 At Yerrinbool, Australia, sessions were conducted in the Hyde Dunn Memorial Hall on the property devoted to Baha'i service by Mr. and Mrs. Bolton, from 

May 28 to June 2, 1944     

 and from April 28 to May 6, 1945. 

 Study of Baha'i administrative principles, reading of selected Tablets and discussion as well as round table programs were carried on through three daily sessions. 

 In 1945 the courses presented were on the Guardian's book, God Passes By, with discussion of "Hu-manity's  Coming of Age" and CCReligion and 'World Order." 

 Another school was conducted at Aidgate, South Australia. 
In 1944 the dates were     

August  11 to 14. Here    

 papers were presented on the subjects of Peace, Three Women of the Holy 

Family, The Development    

 of a World Consciousness, The Measure of Revelation, Youth, The Divine Manifestations, Consultation, Patterns and Plans for 

Living.                    

 The first school conducted at Sydney, Australia, held sessions on November 4 and 5, 1944. The program, though brief, presented papers which embodied careful research  into the Baha'i teachings: Youth and the New World Order; Christianity and the Baha Faith; Holy Places of the Baha'i Revelation; 

Can Human Intelligence     
Alone Create a Stable      
Civilization?              

 At Esslingen, Germany, the school which had been suppressed during the Nazi regime reopened in December, 1945 with a course of three public lectures on: And the Light Is Shining in the 

Darkness; The Baha'i       
Faith As a Way to a New    
World Order; The Foundation 
of All Religions Is One.   

 Considerable public interest was shown, and the believers were encouraged to open introductory classes for inquirers. 

 The study conference held at Banff, Alberta,  Canada, August 19 to 24, 1945, was arranged by the Regional Teaching Committee  and formed the third annual session. In 1944, however, the conference was omitted in order to enable more of the Baha'is to attend the Centenary meetings and the Convention at 

Wilmette.                  

 Fine daily classes were held on the Guardian's book, God Passes By and on the subject  of Baha'i Administration. Lectures were delivered on New Horizons in Religion and Preparing for the World of Tomorrow: and a forum provided two sessions on Proclamation of the Baha'i Faith. 

 All four schools in the United States held sessions annually during the period under review. 

 At the Geyserville School, Geyserville. California, the Baha'i teachings on peace were developed in 1945, the daily subjects being: 

The Struggle for Peace     
From Early Times to the    

First World War; The       
Struggle for Pea ce — First  

International Organization; The
Struggle for Peace — Current 
Developments;  The Outlook

 for Peace; Humanitarian Aspects of the Peace; 

Political and Administrative

 Aspects of the Peace; Economic  Aspects of the Peace; Spiritual Aspects of the Peace; The Lesser 

Peace; Sources for Enduring
Peace; The Most Great      
Peace; and Building the    

Peace.                     

 Concurrently, the distinguished truths of the Baha'i Faith were expounded and discussed in daily topics: The 

Renewal of Faith; God      
and Man; Divine Physicians;

       CENTENARY          OF THE PROCLAMATION OF
THE BAn                    

  May 23, 1944 brought together the Baha'is of all lands in local or national celebration  of the Anniversary of the Inauguration  of the Faith by the Mb, at £hir4z, Persia. The Spirit descended into humanity in that hour has manifested itself in the most exalted expressions of religious devotion and sacrifice, in the illumination of minds, in the evolution of a world community, and in one hundred years of social tumult which have overthrown the cultures, creeds and political philosophies of the past. For Baha'is, this observance brought deeper recognition of the divine mission of the B~b in establishing, for the first time on earth, the oneness of all the prophets and messengers. 

 The Baha'i Centenary was truly the first Holy Day offered to all mankind on equal terms. 

 The present volume dedicates a special section  to the Anniversary. 

 In this survey only a brief reference can be made. Among the significant results of the Centenary one notes: the "Baha'i World Survey" compiled by Shoghi Effendi; his incomparable  historical work recounting the events and deeper meanings of the first Baha'i century; construction or purchase of buildings suitable for a national Baha'i headquarters  in a number of countries; publication of centenary volumes by the National Spiritual Assemblies of India, British Isles and the United States; culmination of intensive  plans for spreading the Faith to new lands; the association of the Baha'is of Latin America and those of North America in an All-American Centenary and Convention; and important developments in the attitude of the public in general toward the idea of a World 

Faith.                     
                           
    BANAl WORLD CENTER         

  During this two-year period land to the value of $100,000 has been added to the endowment  of the Shrine of the Bab on Mr. Carmel. 

 Work has begun on the construction  of the superstructure of the Shrine over the sacred remains of the Manifestation who inaugurated a new dispensation and heralded the coming of 

Baha'u'llah.

             SACRED      
             WRITINGS    
             1.          

               WORDS OF BAHA'U'LLAH

PRAYERS AND                

  GLORIFIED art Thou, 0 Lord my God! Every man of insight confesseth Thy sovereignty  and Thy dominion, and every discerning eye perceiveth the greatness of Thy majesty and the compelling power of Thy might. 

 The winds of tests are powerless to hold back them that enjoy near access to Thee from setting their faces towards the horizon of Thy glory, and the tempests of trials must fail to draw away and hinder such as are wholly devoted to Thy will from approaching Thy court. 

 Methinks, the lamp of Thy love is burning in their hearts, and the light of Thy tenderness is lit within their breasts. 

 Adversities are incapable of estranging them from Thy Cause, and the vicissitudes of fortune can never cause them to stray from Thy pleasure. 

 I beseech Thee, 0 my God, by them and by the sighs which their hearts utter in their separation from Thee, to keep them safe from the mischief of Thine adversaries, and to nourish their souis with what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones on whom shall come no fear and who shall nqt be put to grief. 

 Unto Thee be praise, 0 Lord my God! I entreat Thee, by Thy signs that have encompassed  the entire creation, and by the light of Thy countenance that hath illuminated all that are in heaven and on earth, and by Thy mercy that hath surpassed all created things, and by Thy grace that hath suffused the whole universe, to rend asunder 

MEDITATIONS                

  the veils ihat shut me out from Thee, that I may hasten unto the FQuntain-Hcad of Thy mighty inspiration, and to the DaySpring of Thy Revelation and bountiful favors, and may be immersed beneath the ocean of Thy nearness and pleasure. 

 Suffer me not, 0 my Lord, to be deprived of the knowledge of Thee in Thy days, and divest me not of the robe of Thy guidance. Give inc to drink of the river that is life indeed, whose waters have streamed forth from the Paradise (Ridvan) in which the throne of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, was established, that mine eyes may be opened, and my face be illumined, and my heart be assured, and my soui be enlightened, and my steps be made firm. 

 Thou art He Who from everlasting was, through the potency of His might, supreme over all things, and, through the operation of His will, was able to ordain all things. Nothing whatsoever, whether in Thy heaven or on Thy earth, can frustrate Thy purpose. Have mercy, then, upon me, 0 my Lord, through Thy gracious providence and generosity,  and incline mine ear to the sweet melodies of the birds that warble their praise of Thee, amidst the branches of the tree of Thy oneness. 

 Thou art the Great Giver, the Ever-For-giving,  the 

Most Compassionate.        

 Glorified art Thou, 0 Lord my God! I beseech 

Thee by Him Who is Thy     

 Most Great Name, Who hath been sorely afflicted 95

96              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  by such of Thy creatures as have repudiated Thy truth, and Who hath been hemmed in by sorrows which no tongue can describe, to grant that I may remember Thee and celebrate Thy praise, in these days when all have turned away from Thy beauty, have disputed with Thee, and turned away disdainfully  from Him Who is the Revealer of Thy Cause. None is there, 0 my Lord, to help Thee except Thine own Self, and no power to succor Thee save Thine own power. 

 I entreat Thee to enable me to cleave steadfastly to Thy Love and Thy remembrance. 

 This is, verily, within my power, and Thou art the One that knoweth all that is in me. Thou, in truth, art knowing, apprised of all. Deprive me not, 0 my Lord, of the splendors of the light of Thy face, whose brightness bath illuminated the whole world. No God is there beside Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving. 

 Magnified be Thy name, 0 Lord my God! Thou art He Whom all things worship and Who worshipeth no one, Who is the Lord of all things and is the vassal of none, Who knoweth all things and is known of none. Thou didst wish to make Thyself known unto men; therefore, Thou didst, through a word of Thy mouth, bring creation into being and fashion the universe. There is none other God except Thee, the Fashioner, the Creator, the Almighty, the Most 

Powerful.                

 I implore Thee, by this very word that hath shone forth above the horizon of Thy will, to enable rue to drink deep of the living waters through which Thou hast vivified the hearts of Thy chosen ones and quickened the souis of them that love Thee, that I may, at all tiffies and under all conditions,  turn my face wholly towards Thee. 

 Thou art the God of power, of glory and bounty. No God is there beside Thee, the Supreme Ruler, the All-Glorious, the Omniscient. 

 Lauded be Thy name, 0 my God! Thou beholdest me in the clutches of my oppressors.  Every time I turn to my right, I hear the voice of the lamentation of them that are dear to Thee, whom the infidels have made captives for having believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and for having set their faces towards the horizon of Thy grace and of Thy lovingkindness. 

 And when I turn to my left, I hear the clamor of the wicked doers who have disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs, and persistently striven to put our the light of Thy lamp which sheddeth the radiance of Thine own Self over all that are in Thy heaven and all that are on Thy earth. 

 The hearts of Thy chosen ones, 0 my Lord, have melted because of their separation from Thee, and the souls of Thy loved ones are burnt up by the fire of their yearning after Thee in Thy days. I implore Thee, 0 Thou Maker of the heavens and Lord of all names, by Thy most effulgent Self and Thy most exalted and all-glorious Remembrance, to send down upon Thy loved ones that which will draw them nearer unto Thee, and enable them to hearken unto Thine utterances. 

 Tear asunder with the hand of Thy transcendent power, 0 my Lord, the veil of vain imaginings, that they who are wholly devoted  to Thee may see Thee seated on the throne of Thy majesty, and the eyes of such as adore Thy unity may reioice at the splendors of the glory of Thy face. The doors of hope have been shut against the hearts that long for Thee, 0 my Lord! 

 Their keys are in Thy hands; open them by the power of Thy might and Thy sovereignty. Potent art Thou to do as Thou pleasest. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Beneficent. 

 Praise be to Thee, 0 Lord my God! I swear by Thy might! Successive afflictions have withheld the pen of the Most. High from laying bare that which is hidden from the eyes of Thy creatures, and incessant trials have hindered the tongue of the Divine Ordainer from proclaiming the wonders of Thy glorification and praise. With a stammering tongue, therefore, I call upon Thee, 0 my God, and with this my afflicted pen I occupy myself in remembrance of Thy name. 

 Is there any man of insight, 0 my God, that can behold Thee with Thine own eye, and where is the thirsty one who can direct

  his face towards the living waters of Thy love? I am the one, 0 my God, who bath blotted out from his heart the remembrance of all except Thee, and bath graven upon it the mysteries of Thy Love. 

 Thine own might beareth me witness! But for tribulations, how could the assured be distinguished from the doubters among Thy servants? 

 They who have been inebriated with the wine of Thy knowledge, these, verily, hasten to meet every manner of adversity in their longing to pass into Thy presence. 

I implore Thee, O Beloved  

 of my heart and the Object of my soul's adoration, to shield them that love me from the faintest trace of evil and corrupt  desires. 

 Supply them, then, with the good of this world and of the next. 

 Thou art, verily, He Whose grace hath guided them aright, He Who hath declared Himself to be the All-Merciful. 

 No God is there but Thee, the All-Glorious, the 

Supreme  Helper.          

 Praise be to Thee, 0 Lord my God! I beseech Thee by this Revelation whereby darkness hath been turned into light, through which the Frequented Fane hath been built, and the 'Written Tablet revealed, and the Outspread Roll uncovered, to send down upon me and upon them who are in my company that which will enable us to soar into the heavens of Thy transcendent glory, and will wash us from the stain of such doubts as have hindered the suspicious from entering into the tabernacle of Thy unity. 

 I am the one, 0 my Lord, who bath held fast the cord of Thy lovingkindness, and clung to the hem of Thy mercy and favors. Do Thou ordain for me and for my loved ones the good of this world and of the world to come. 

 Supply them, then, with the Hidden  Gift Thou didst ordain for the choicest among Thy creatures. 

 These are, 0 my Lord, the days in which Thou hast bidden Thy servants to observe the fast. Blessed is he that observeth the fast wholly for Thy sake and with absolute detachment  from all things except Thee. Assist me and assist them, 0 my Lord, to obey Thee and to keep Thy precepts. 

 Thou, verily, hast power to do what Thou choosest. 

 There is no God, but Thee, the All-Know-ing,  the All-Wise. All praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds. 

 Glorified be Thy name, 0 Lord my God! Thou beholdest my dwelling-place, and the prison into which I am cast, and the woes I suffer. By Thy might! 

 No pen can recount  them, nor can any tongue describe or number them. I know not, 0 my God, for what purpose Thou hast abandoned me to Thine adversaries. 
Thy glory beareth me witness!

 I sorrow not for the vexations I endure for love of Thee, nor feel perturbed by the calamities that overtake me in Thy path. 

 My grief is rather because Thou de-layest  to fulfill what Thou hast determined in the Tablets of Thy Revelation, and ordained  in the books of Thy decree and judgment. 

 My blood, at all times, addresseth me saying: "0 Thou Who art the Image of the Most Merciful! 

 How long will it be ere Thou riddest me of the captivity of this world, and deliverest me from the bondage of this life? 

 Didst Thou not promise me that Thou shalt dye the earth with me, and sprinkle me on the faces of the inmates of Thy Paradise?"  To this I make reply: "Be thou patient and quiet thyself. 

 The things thou desirest can last but an hour. As to me, however, I quaff continually in the path of God the cup of His decree, and wish not that the ruling of His will should cease to operate, or that the woes I suffer for the sake of my Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, should be ended. Seek thou my wish and forsake thine own. 

 Thy bondage is not for my protection,  but to enable me to sustain successive  tribulations, and to prepare me for the trials that must needs repeatedly assail me. Perish that lover who discerneth between the pleasant and the poisonous in his love for his beloved! 

 Be thou satisfied with what God hath destined for thee. He, verily, ruleth over thee as LIe willeth and pleaseth. 

 No God is there but Him, the Inaccessible, the Most 

High."                     

 Magnified be Thy name, 0 Lord my God! I know not what the water is with which Thou hast created me, or what the fire Thou hast kindled within me, or the clay wherewith Thou hast kneaded me. 
The restlessness

98               THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of every sea hath been stilled, but not the restlessness of this Ocean which moveth at the bidding of the winds of Thy will. The flame of every fire bath been extinguished except the Flame which the hands of Thine omnipotence have kindled, and whose radiance Thou hast, by the power of Thy name, shed abroad before all that are in Thy heaven and all that are on Thy earth. As the tribu —  lations deepen, it waxeth hotter and hotter. 

 Behold, then, 0 my God, how Thy Light bath been compassed with the onrushing winds of Thy decree, how the tempests that blow and beat upon it from every side have added to its brightness and increased its splendor. For all this let Thee be praised. 
     I implore Thee, by Thy     

Most Great Name, and Thy   

 most ancient sovereignty, to look upon Thy loved ones whose hearts have been sorely shaken by reason of the troubles that have touched Him Who is the 

Manifestation of Thine     

 own Self. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the A11~Knowing, the All-Wise. 

 0 Thou Whose face is the object of the adoration of all that yearn after Thee, Whose presence is the hope of such as are wholly devoted to Thy will, Whose nearness is the desire of all that have drawn nigh unto Thy court, Whose countenance is the companion of those who have recognized Thy truth, Whose name is the mover of the souls that long to behold Thy face, Whose voice is the true life of Thy lovers, the words of Whose mouth are as the waters of life unto all who are in heaven and on earth! 

 I beseech Thee, by the wrong Thou hast suffered and the ills inflicted upon Thee by the hosts of wrongful doers, to send down upon me from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will purify me of all that is not of Thee, that I may be worthy to praise Thee and fit to iovc Thee. 

 Withhold not from me, 0 my Lord, the things Thou didst ordain for such of Thy handmaiclens as circle around Thee, and on whom are poured continually the splendors of the sun of Thy beauty and the beams of the brightness of Thy face. Thou art He Who from everlasting hath sticcored whosoever hath sought Thee, and bountifully favored him who hath asked Thee. 

 No God is there beside Thee, the Mighty, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Bounteous, the Most 

Generous.                  

 Lauded be Thy name, 0 Lord my God! Darkness hath fallen upon every land, and the forces of mischief have encompassed all the nations. 

 Through them, however, I perceive  the splendors of Thy wisdom, and discern the brightness of the light of Thy providence. 

 They that are shut out as by a veil from Thee have imagined that they have the power to put out Thy light, and to quench Thy fre, and to still the winds of Thy grace. Nay, and to this Thy might beareth me witness! Had not every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy wisdom, and every ordeal the vehicle of Thy providence, no one would have dared oppose us, though the powers of earth and heaven were to be leagued against us. Were I to unravel the wo'ndroiss mysteries of Thy wisdom which are laid bare before me, the reins of Thine enemies would be cleft asunder. 

 Glorified be Thou, then, 0 my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to assemble them that love Thee around the Law that streameth from the good-pleasure of Thy will, and to send down upon them what will assure their hearts. 

 Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. 

 Praise be unto Thee, Who art my God and the God of all men, and my Desire and the Desire of all them that have recognized  Thee, and my Beloved and the Beloved  of such as have acknowledged Thy unity, and the Object of my adoration and of the adoration of them that have near access to Thee, and my Wish and the Wish of such as are wholly devoted to Thee, and my Hope and the Hope of them that have fixed their hearts upon Thee, and my Refuge and the Refuge of all such as have hastened towards Thee, and my Haven and the Haven of whosoever hath repaired unto Thee, and my Goal and the Goal of all them that have set themselves towards Thee, and my Object and the Object of those who have fixed their gaze upon Thee, and my Paradise and the

  Paradise of them that have ascended towards Thee, and my LodeStar and the LodeStar of all such as yearn after Thee, and my Joy and the Joy of all them that love Thee, and my Light and the Light of all such as have erred and asked to be forgiven by Thee, and my Exultation and the Exultation of all them that remember Thee, and my Stronghold  and the Stronghold of all such as have fled to Thee, and my Sanctuary and the Sanctuary of all that dread Thee, and my Lord and the Lord of all such as dwell in the heavens and on the earth! 

 Unto Thee be praise for that Thou hast enraptured me by the sweetness of Thine utterances, and set me towards the horizon above which the splendors of the DayStar of Thy face have shone, and caused me to turn unto Thee at a time when most of Thy creatures had broken off from Thee. 

 Thou art He, 0 my God, Who hath unlocked  the gate of heaven with the key of Thy Name, the Ever-Blessed, the All-Pow-erful,  the 

All-Glorious, the Most    

 Great, and Inst summoned all mankind to the ocean of Thy presence. No sooner had Thy most sweet voice been raised, than all the inmates of the Kingdom of Names and the Concourse on high were stirred up. By Thy call the fragrance of the raiment of Thy revelation  was wafted over such of Thy creatures as have loved Thee, and such of Thy people as have yearned towards Thee. They rose up and rushed forth to attain the Ocean of Thy meeting, and the Horizon of Thy beauty, and the Tabernacle of Thy revelation and Thy majesty, and the sanctuary of Thy presence and Thy glory. They were so inebriated with the wine of their reunion with Thee, that they rid themselves of all attachment  to whatever they themselves and others possessed. 

 These are Thy servants whom the ascendancy  of the oppressor hath failed to deter from fixing their eyes on the Tabernacle of Thy majesty, and whom the hosts of tyranny have been powerless to affright and divert their gaze from the DaySpring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy testimonies. 

 I swear by Thy glory, 0 Thou the Lord of all being and the Enlightener of all things visible and invisible! Whoso hath quaffed from the hands of Thy bounteousness the living waters of Thy love will never allow the things pertaining to Thy creatures to keep him back from Thee, neither will he be dismayed at the refusal of all the dwellers of Thy realm to acknowledge Thee. Before all who are in heaven and on earth such a man will cry aloud, and announce unto the people the tumult of the Ocean of Thy bounty and the splendors of the Luminaries  of the heaven of Thy bestowals. 

 Happy indeed is the man that hath turned towards the sanctuary of Thy presence, and rid himself of all attachment to any one except Thyself. 

 He is truly exalted who hath confessed Thy glory, and fixed his eyes upon the DayStar of Thy lovingkindness. He is endued with understanding who is aware of Thy revelation and hath acknowledged. 

 Thy manifold tokens, Thy signs, and Thy testimonies. 

 He is a man of insight whose eyes have been illumined with the brightness of Thy face, and who, as soon as Thy call was raised, hath recognized Thee. He is a man of hearing who hath been led to hearken unto Thy speech, and to draw nigh unto the billowing ocean of Thine utterances. 

 Behold Thou this stranger, 0 my Lord, who hath hastened to attain his most exalted Home in the shelter of Thy shadowing mercy, and this ailing soui who hath set his face towards the ocean of Thy healing. 

 Look, then, 0 Thou my God who settest my soui on fire, upon the tears I shed, and the sighs I utter, and the anguish that afflicteth my heart and the fire that con-sumeth my being. Thy glory beareth me witness, 0 Thou, the Light of the world! The fire of Thy love that burneth continually  within me hath so inflamed me that whoever among Thy creatures approacheth me, and inclineth his inner ear towards me, cannot fail to hear its raging within each of my veins. 

 I am so carried away by the sweetness of Thine utterances, and so inebriated with the wine of Thy tender mercies, that my voice can never be stilled, nor can my suppliant hands any longer desist from being stretched out towards Thee. Thou seest, 0 my Lord, how mine eyes are fixed in the direction of Thy grace, and mine ears inclined towards


<p100>
100             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the kingdom of Thine utterance, and my tongue unloosed to celebrate Thy praise, and my face set towards Thy face that surviveth all that bath been created by Thy word, and my hands raised up towards the heaven of Thy bounty and favor. 

 Wilt Thou keep back from Thee the stranger whom Thou didst call unto his most exalted Home beneath the shadow of the wings of Thy mercy, or cast away the wretched creature that bath hastened to at-tam  the shores of the ocean of Thy wealth? Wilt Thou shut up the door of Thy grace to the face of Thy creatures after having opened it through the power of Thy might and of Thy sovereignty, or close the eyes of Thy people when Thou hast already commanded  them to turn unto the DaySpring of Thy beauty and the Dawning-Place of the splendors of Thy countenance? 

 Nay, and to this Thy glory beareth me witnessl Such is not my thought of Thee, nor the thought of those of Thy servants that have near access to Thyself, nor that of the sincere amongst Thy people. 

 Thou knowest, and seest, and hearest, 0 my Lord, that before every tree I am moved to lift up my voice to Thee, and before every stone I am impelled to sigh and lament.  Math it been Thy purpose in creating me, 0 my God, to touch me with tribulation,  or to enable me to manifest Thy Cause in the kingdom of Thy creation? 

 Thou hearest, 0 my God, my sighs and my groaning, and beholdest my powerlessness, and my poverty, and my misery, and my woes, and my wretchedness. I swear by Thy might! I have wept with such a weeping  that I have been unable to make mention of Thee, or to extol Thee, and cried with such a bitter cry that every mother in her bereavement was bewildered at me, and forgot  her own anguish and the sighs she had uttered. 

 I implore Thee, 0 my Lord, by Thine Ark, through which the potency of Thy will was manifested and the energizing influences of Thy purpose were revealed, and which saileth on both land and sea through the power of Thy might, not to seize me in my mighty sins and great trespasses. 
I swear by Thy Glory!     

 The waters of Thy forgiveness and Thy mercy have emboldened me, as bath Thy dealing, in bygone ages, with the sincere among Thy chosen ones, and with such of Thy Messengers as have proclaimed Thy oneness. 

 I am well aware, 0 my Lord, that I have been so carried away by the clear tokens of Thy lovingkindness, and so completely inebriated with the wine of Thine utverahce, that whatever I behold I readily discover that it maketh Thee known unto me, and it remindeth me of Thy si~gns, and of Thy tokens, and of 

Thy testimonies. By Thy Glory!

 Every time I lift up mine eyes unto Thy heaven, I call to mind 'Thy highness and Thy loftiness, and Thine incomparable glory and greatness; and eyery time I turn my gaze to Thine earth, I am made to recognize the evidences of Thy power and the tokens of Thy bounty. And when I behold the sea, I find that it speaketh to me of Thy majesty, and of the potency of Thy might, and of Thy sovereignty and Thy grandeur. And at whatever time I contemplate the mountains, I am led to discover the ensigns of Thy victory and the standards of Thine omnipotence. 

 I swear by Thy might, 0 Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all mankind, and the destinies of the nations! I am so inflamed by my love for Thee, and so inebriated with the wine of Thy oneness, that I can hear from the whisper of the winds the sound of Thy glorification and praise, and can recognize  in the murmur of the waters the voice that proclaimeth Thy yirtues and Thine attributes, and can apprehend from the rustling of the leaves the mysteries that have been irrevocably ordained by Thee in Thy realm. 

 Glorified art Thou, 0 God of all names and Creator of the heavens! I render Thee thanks that Thou hast made known unto Thy servants this Day whereon the river that is life indeed hath flowed forth from the fingers of Thy bounty, and the springtime of Thy revelation and Thy presence hath appeared through Thy manifestation unto all who are in Thy heaven and all who are on Thy earth. 

 This is the Day, 0 my Lord, whose brightness Thou hast exalted above the brightness of the sun and the splendors thereof. I testify that the light it sheddeth proceedeth out of the glory of the light of Thy counte

  nance, and is begotten by the radiance of the morn of Thy revelation. 

 This is the Day whereon the hopeless have been clothed with the raiment of confidence, and the sick attired with the robe of healing, and the poor drawn nigh unto the ocean of Thy riches. 
                           
THE ATTAINMENT OF UNDERSTANDING

  No man shall attain-the shores of the ocean of true understanding except he be detached from all that is in heaven and on earth. Sanctify your souls, 0 ye peoples of the world, that haply ye may attain that station which God hath destined for you and enter thus the tabernacle which, according to the dispensations of Providence, hath been raised in the firmament of the 

Bay~in.                    

 The essence of these words is this: they that tread the path of faith, they that thirst for the wine of certitude, must cleanse themselves of all that is earthly — their ears from idle talk, their minds from vain imaginings, their hearts from worldly affections,  their eyes from that which perisheth. They should put their trust in God, and, holding fast unto Him, follow in His way. Then will they be made worthy of the effulgent glories of the sun of divine knowi-. edge and understanding, and become the recipients of a grace that is infinite and unseen, inasmuch as man can never hope to attain unto the knowledge of the All-Glor-ious, can never quaff from the stream of divine knowledge ~nd wisdom, can never enter the abode of immortality, nor partake  of the cup of divine nearness and favour, unless and until he ceases to regard the words and deeds of mortal men as a standard for the true understanding and recognition of God and His Prophets. 

 Consider the past. How many, both high and iow, have, at all times, yearningly awaited the advent of the Manifestations of God in the sanctified persons of His chosen Ones. 

 How often have they expected His coming, how frequently have they prayed that the breeze of divine mercy might blow, and the promised Beauty step forth from behind the veil of concealment, and be made manifest to all the world. And whensoever the portals of grace did open, and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon mankind, and the light of the Unseen did shine above the horizon of celestial might, they all denied Him, and turned tway from His face — the face of God Himself. Refer ye, to verify this truth, to that which hath been recorded in every sacred 

Book.                      

 Ponder for a moment, and reflect upon that which hath been the cause of such denial on the part of those who have searched with such earnestness and longing. Their attack bath been more fierce than tongue or pen can describe. Not one single 

Manifestation  of Holiness

 hath appeared but He was afflicted by the denials, the repudiation, and the vehement opposition of the people around Him. 

 Thus it hath been revealed: "0 the misery of men! 

 No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him to scorn."1 Again He saith: "Each nation hath plotted darkly against their Messenger to lay violent hold on Him, and disputed with vain words to invalidate the truth."2 In like manner, those words that have streamed forth from the source of power and descended from the heaven of glory are innumerable and beyond the ordinary comprehension of man. To them that are possessed of true understanding and insight the Sarah of Hiid surely sufficeth. Ponder  a while those holy words in your heart, and, with utter detachment, strive to grasp their meaning. Examine the wondrous behaviour of the Prophets, and recall the defamations and denials uttered by the children  of negation and falsehood, perchance you may cause the bird of the human heart to wing its flight away from the abodes of heedlessness and doubt unto the nest of faith and certainty, and drink deep from the pure waters of ancient wisdom, and partake of the fruit of the tree of divine knowledge. Such is the share of the pure in heart of the bread that hath descended from the realms of eternity and holiness. 

 Should you acquaint yourself with the indignities heaped upon the Prophets of God, and apprehend the true causes of the objections voiced by their oppressors, you will surely appreciate the significance of their position. 

 Moreover, the more closely you

<p102>
102             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  observe the denials of those who have opposed the Manifestations of the divine attributes, the firmer will be your faith in the Cause of God. Accordingly, a brief mention will be made in this Tablet of divers accounts relative to the Prophets of God, that they may demonstrate the truth that throughout all ages and centuries the Manifestations of power and glory have been subjected to such heinous cruelties that no pen dare describe them. 

 Perchance this may enable a few to cease to be perturbed by the clamour and protestations of the divines and the foolish of this age, and cause them to strengthen their confidence and certainty. 

 Among the Prophets was Noah. For nine hundred and fifty years He prayerfully exhorted  His people and summoned them to the haven of security and peace. 

 None, however, heeded His call. Each day they inflicted on His blessed person such pain and suffering that no one believed He could survive.  How frequently they denied Him, how malevolently they hinted their suspicion against Him! Thus it hath been revealed:  "And as often as a company of His people passed by Him, they derided Him. 

 To them He said: tThough ye scoff at us now, we will scoff at you hereafter even as ye scoff at us. In the end ye shall know.' 

 ~ Long afterward, He several times promised victory to His companions and fixed the hour thereof. 

 But when the hour struck, the divine promise was not fulfilled. This caused a few among the small number of His followers  to turn away from Him, and to this testify the records of the bestknown books. These you must certainly have perused; if not, undoubtedly you will. Finally, as stated in books and traditions, there remained with Him only forty or seventy-two of His foLlowers.  At last from the depth of His being He cried aloud: "Lord! Leave not upon the land a single dweller from among the unbelievers."2 And now, consider and reflect a moment upon the waywardness of this people. What could have been the reason for such denial and avoidance on their part? What could have induced them to refuse to put off the garment of denial, and to adorn themselves 

Qur'an 11:38.              
2 Qur'an 71:26.            
with the robe of acceptance?

 Moreover, what could have caused the nonfulfilment of the divine promise which led the seekers to reject that which they had accepted? Meditate profoundly, that the secret of things unseen may be revealed unto you, that you may inhale the sweetness of a spiritual and imperishable fragrance, and that you may acknowledge the truth that from time immemorial even unto eternity the Almighty hath tried, and will continue to try, His servants, so that light may be distinguished  from darkness, truth from falsehood, right from wrong, guidance from error, happiness from misery, and roses from thorns. Even as He hath revealed: "Do men think when they say "We believe' they shall be let alone ahd not be put to proof?"3 And after Noah the light of the countenance  of H~d shone forth above the horizon of creation. 

 For well-nigh seven hundred years, according to the sayings of men, He exhorted the people to turn their faces and draw nearer unto the RidvTh of the divine presence. What showers of afflictions rained upon Him, until at last His adjurations bore the fruit of increased rebelliousness, and His assiduous endeavours resulted in the wilful blindness of His peopie. "And their unbelief shall only increase for the unbelievers their own perdition."4 And after Him there appeared from the Ridvan of the Eternal, the Invisible, the holy person of SAlib, Who again summoned the people to the river of everlasting life. For over a hundred years He admonished them to hold fast unto the commandments of God and eschew that which is forbidden. His admonitions, however, yielded no fruit, and His pleading proved of no avail. Several  times He retired and lived in seclusion. All this, although that eternal Beauty was summoning the people to no other than the city of God. Even as it is revealed: "And unto the tribe of Thami~d We sent their brother $41i1i. ~ my people,' said He, tWor-ship  God, ye have none other God beside Him. .' They made reply: ~ ~li1j~, our hopes were fixed on thee until now; f or —  biddest thou us to worship that which our fathers worshipped? 

 Truly we misdoubt 3Qur'in 29:2. 
4Qur'~n 35:39.

EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS        103

  that whereunto thou callest us as suspicious.'  "~ All this proved fruitless, until at last there went up a great cry, and all fell into utter perdition. 

 Later, the beauty of the countenance of the Friend of God2 appeared from behind the veil, and another standard of divine guidance was hoisted. He invited the people of the earth to the light of righteousness. The more passionately He exhorted them, the fiercer waxed the envy and waywardness of the people, except those who wholly detached  themselves from all save God, and ascended on the wings of certainty to the station which God hail exalted beyond the comprehension of men. It is well known what a host of enemies besieged Him, until at last the fires of envy and rebellion were kindled against Him. 

 And after the episode of the fire came to pass, He, the lamp of God amongst men, was, as recorded in all books and chronicles, expelled from His city. 

 And when His day was ended, there came the turn of Moses. Armed with the rod of celestial dominion, adorned with the white hand of divine knowledge, and proceeding from the P6rin of the love of God, and wielding the serpent of power and everlasting  majesty, He shone forth from the Sinai of light upon the world. 

 He summoned  all the peoples and kindreds of the earth to the kingdom of eternity, and invited them to partake of the fruit of the tree of faithfulness. Surely you are aware of the fierce opposition of Pharaoh and his people, and of the stones of idle fancy which the hands of infidels cast upon that blessed Tree. 

 So much so that Pharaoh and his people finally arose and exerted their utmost endeavor to extinguish with the waters of falsehood and denial the fire of that sacred Tree, oblivious of the truth that no earthly water can quench the flame of divine wisdom, nor mortal blasts extinguish the lamp of everlasting dominion. Nay, rather, such water cannot but intensify the burning of the flame, and such blasts cannot but insure the preservation of the lamp, were ye to observe with the eye of discernment, and walk in the way of God's holy will and pleasure. 

 How well hath a believer of the 'Qur'an 11:61, 62. 

2 Abraham.                

 kindred of Pharaoh, whose story is recounted by the All-Glorious in His Book revealed unto His beloved One, observed: "And a man of the family of Pharaoh who was a believer and concealed his faith said: CWi11 ye slay a man because he saith my Lord is God, when He hath already come to you with signs from your Lord? If he be a liar, on him will be his lie, but if he be a man of truth, part of what he threateneth will fall upon you. In truth God guideth not him who is a transgressor, a liar.' 

 "~ Finally, so great was their iniquity that this self —  same believer was put to a shameful death. CCThe curse of God be upon the people of tyranny." 

 And now, ponder upon these things. What could have caused such contention and conflict?  Why is it that the advent of every true Manifestation of God hath been accompanied by such strife and tumult, by such tyranny and upheaval? 

 This notwithstanding the fact that all the Prophets of God, whenever made manifest unto the peoples of the world, have invariably foretold  the coming of yet another Prophet after them, and have established such signs as would herald the advent of the future Dispensation.  To this the records of all sacred books bear witness. Why then is it that despite the expectation of men in their quest of the Manifestations of Holiness, and in spite of the signs recorded in the sacred books, should such acts of violence, of oppression  and cruelty, have been perpetrated in every age and cycle against all the Prophets and chosen 

Ones of God? Even as He   

 hath revealed: "As oft as an Apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not, ye swell with pride, accusing some of being impostors and slaying others."4 Reflect, what could have been the motive for such deeds? What could have prompted such behaviour towards the Revealers of the beauty of the All-Glorious? 

 Whatever in days gone by hath been the cause of the denial and opposition of those people hath now led to the perversity of the people of this age. To maintain that the testimony of Providence was incomplete, that it hath therefore been the cause of the denial of 2Qur'An 40:28. 
4Qur'An 2:87.

  the people, is but open blasphemy. How far from the grace of the All-Bountiful and from His loving providence and tender mercies  it is to single out a soui from amongst all men for the guidance of His creatures, and, on one hand, to withhold from Him the full measure of His divine testimony, and, on the other, inflict severe retribution on His people for having turned away from His chosen One! 

 Nay, the manifold bounties of the Lord of all beings have, at all times, through the Manifestations of His divine Essence, encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein. Not for a moment hath His grace been withheld, nor have the showers of His lovingkindness ceased to rain upon mankind. 

 Consequently, such behaviour can be attributed to naught save the petty-mindedness of such souls as tread the valley of arrogance and pride, are lost in the wilds of remoteness, walk in the ways of their idle fancy, and follow the dictates of the leaders of their faith. Their chief concern is mere opposition; their sole desire is to ignore the truth. Unto every discerning observer it is evident and manifest that had these people in the days of each of the Manifestations of the Sun of Truth sanctified their eyes, their ears, and their hearts from whatever they had seen, heard, and felt, they surely would not have been deprived of beholding the beauty of God, nor strayed far from the habitations of glory. 

 But having weighed the testimony of God by the standard of their own knowledge,  gleaned from the teachings of the leaders of their faith, and found it at variance  with their limited understanding, they arose to perpetrate such unseemly acts. 

 Leaders of religion, in every age, have hindered their people from attaining the shores of eternal salvation, inasmuch as they held the reins of authority in their mighty grasp. 

 Some for the lust of leadership, others through want of knowledge and understanding,  have been the cause of the deprivation of the people. By their sanction and authority, every Prophet of God hath drunk from the chalice of sacrifice, and winged His flight unto the heights of glory. What unspeakable cruelties they that have occupied the seats of authority and learning have inflicted upon the true Monarchs of the world, those Gems of divine virtue! 

 Content with a transitory dominion, they have deprived themselves of an everlasting sovereignty. Thus, their eyes beheld not the light of the countenance of the Well-Beloved, nor did their ears hearken unto the sweet melodies of the Bird of Desire. For this reason, in all sacred books mention hath been made of the divines of every age. Thus He saith: tt~~ people of the Book! 

 Why disbelieve the signs of God to which ye yourselves have been witness?"1 And also He saith: ~O people of the Book! Why clothe ye the truth with falsehood? 

 Why wittingly hide the truth?"2 Again, He saith: "Say, 0 people of the Book, Why repel believers from the way of God?"3 It is evident that by the t! 

 of the Book,'' who have repelled their fellowmen from the straight path of God, is meant none other than the divines of that age, whose names and character have been revealed in the sacred books, and alluded  to in the verses and traditions recorded therein, were you to observe with the eye of God. 

 With fixed and steady gaze, born of the unerring eye of God, scan for a while the horizon of divine knowledge, and contemplate  those words of perfection which the Eternal hath revealed, that haply the mysteries of divine wisdom, hidden ere now beneath the veil of glory and treasured within the tabernacle of His grace, may be made manifest unto you. The denials and protestations of these leaders of religion have, in the main, been due to their lack of knowledge  and understanding. 

 Those words uttered  by the Revealers of the beauty of the one true God, setting forth the signs that should herald the advent of the Manifestation to come, they never understood nor fathomed. Hence they raised the standard of revolt, and stirred up mischief and sedition. 

 It is obvious and manifest that the true meaning of the utterances of the Birds of Eternity is revealed to none except those that manifest the Eternal Being, and the melodies of the Nightingale of Holiness can reach no ear save that of the denizens of the everlasting realm. The Copt of tyranny can 'Qur'an 3:70.

  never partake of the cup touched by the lips of the Sept of justice, and the Pharaoh of unbelief can never hope to recognize the hand of the Moses of truth. Even as He saith: t(N knoweth the meaning thereof except God and them that are well-grounded in knowledge."1 And yet, they have sought the interpretation of the Book from those that are wrapt in veils, and have refused to seek enlightenment from the fountainhead of knowledge. 

 And when the days of Moses were ended, and the light of Jesus, shining forth from the dayspring of the Spirit, encompassed the world, all the people of Israel arose in protest against Him. They clamoured that He Whose advent the Bible had foretold must needs promulgate and fulfil the laws of Moses, whereas this youthful Nazarene, who laid claim to the station of the divine Messiah, had annulled the law of divorce and of the sabbath day — the most weighty of all the laws of Moses. Moreover, what of the signs of the Manifestation yet to come? 

 These people of Israel are even unto the present day still expecting that Manifestation  which the Bible hath foretold! 

How many Manifestations   

 of Holiness, how many Revealers of the light everlasting, have appeared  since the time of Moses, and yet Israel, wrapt in the densest veils of satanic fancy and false imaginings, is still expectant that the idol of her own handiwork will appear with such signs as she herself bath conceived! Thus bath God laid hold of them for their sins, hath extinguished in them the spirit of faith, and tormented them with the flames of the nethermost fire. 

 And this for no other reason except that Israel refused  to apprehend the meaning of such words as have been revealed in the Bible concerning the signs of the coming Revelation.  As she never grasped their true significance, and, to outward seeming, such events never came to pass, she, therefore, remained deprived of recognizing the beauty of Jesus and of beholding the face of God. And they still await His coming! From time immemorial even unto this day, all the kindreds and peoples of the earth have clung to such fanciful and unseemly thoughts, and 

1 Qur'an 3:7.             

 thus have deprived themselves of the clear waters streaming from the springs of purity and holiness. 

 In unfolding these mysteries, We have, in Our former Tablets which were addressed to a friend in the melodious language of JfLijiz, cited a few of the verses revealed unto the Prophets of old. 

 And now, responding  to your request, We again shall cite, in these pages, those same verses, uttered this time in the wondrous accents of 'Ir4q, that haply the sore athirst in the wilds of remoteness may attain unto the ocean of the divine presence, and they that languish in the wastes of separation be led unto the home of eternal reunion. Thus the mists of error may be dispelled, and the all —  resplendent light of divine guidance dawn forth above the horizon of human hearts. In God We put Our trust, and to Him We cry for help, that haply there may flow from this pen that which shall quicken the souis of men, that they may all arise from their beds of heedlessness and hearken unto the rustling of the leaves of Paradise, from the tree which the hand of divine power hath, by the permission of God, planted in the Ridvan of the All-Glorious. 

 To them that are endowed with understanding,  it is clear and manifest that when the fire of the iove of Jesus consumed the veils of Jewish limitations, and His authority  was made apparent and partially enforced,  He the Revealer of the unseen Beauty, addressing one day His disciples, referred  unto His passing, and, kindling in their hearts the fire of bereavement, said unto them: "I go away and come again unto you." 

 And in another place He said: ~ go and another will come Who will tell you all that I have not told you, and will fulfil all that I have said." Both these sayings have but one meaning, were you to ponder upon the Manifestations of the Unity of God with divine insight. 

 Every discerning observer will recognize that in the Dispensation of the Qur'an both the Book and the Cause of Jesus were confirmed.  As to the matter of names, Muhammad, Himself, declared: "I am Jesus." He recognized the truth of the signs, prophecies, and words of Jesus, and testified that they were all of God. In this sense,


<p106>
106             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  neither the person of Jesus nor His writings hath differed from that of Muhammad and of His holy Book, inasmuch as both have championed the Cause of God, uttered His praise, and revealed His commandments. Thus it is that Jesus, Himself, declared: ttj go away and come again unto you." 

 Consider  the sun. "Were it to say now, "I am the sun of yesterday,". it would speak the truth. 

 And should it, bearing the sequence of time in mind, claim to be other than that sun, it still would speak the truth. 

 In like manner, if it be said that all the days are but one and the same, it is correct and true. And if it be said, with respect to their particular  names and designations, that they differ, that again is true. For though they arc the same, yet one doth recognize in each a separate designation, a specific attribute, a particular character. 

 Conceive accordingly the distinction, variation, and unity characteristic of the various Manifestations of holiness, that thou mayest comprehend the allusions made by the creator of all names and attributes to the mysteries of distinction and unity, and discover the answer to thy question as to why that everlasting Beauty should have, at sundry times, called Himself by different names and titles. 

 Afterwards, the companions and disciples of Jesus asked Him concerning those signs that must needs signalize the return of His manifestation. 

 'When, they asked, shall these things be? Several times they questioned that peerless Beauty, and, every time He made reply, He set forth a special sign that should herald the advent of the promised Dispensation. 

 To this testify the records of the four Gospels. 

 This wronged One will cite but one of these instances, thus conferring upon mankind,  for the sake of God, such bounties as are yet concealed within the treasury of the hidden and sacred Tree, that haply mortal men may not remain deprived of their share of the immortal fruit, and attain  to a dewdrop of the waters of everlasting  life which, from BaghdAd, the "Abode of Peace," are being vouchsafed unto all mankind. We ask for neither meed nor reward. 

 "We nourish your souls for the sake of God; we seek from you neither rec ompense nor thanks."1 This is the food that conferreth everlasting life upon the pure in heart and the illumined in spirit. This is the bread of which it is said: "Lord, send down upon us Thy bread from heaven."2 This bread shall never be withheld  from them that deserve it, nor can it ever be exhausted. 

 It groweth everlastingly from the tree of grace; it descendeth at all seasons from the heavens of justice and mercy. Even as He saith: CtSt thou not to what God likeneth a good word? To a good tree; its root firmly fixed, and its branches reaching unto heaven: yielding its fruit in all seasons."3 0 the pity! that man should deprive himself  of this goodly gift, this imperishable bounty, this everlasting life. 

 It behooveth him to prize this food that cometh from heaven, that perchance, through the wondrous favours of the Sun of Truth, the dead may be brought to life, and withered souls be quickened by the infinite Spirit. Make haste, 0 my brother, that while there is yet time our lips may taste of the immortal  draught, for the breeze of life, now blowing from the city of the Well-Beloved, cannot last, and the streaming river of holy utterance must needs be stilled, and the portals of the Ridvan cannot for ever remain open. The day will surely come when the Nightingale of Paradise will have winged its flight away from its earthly abode unto its heavenly nest. 

 Then will its melody be heard no more, and the beauty of the rose cease to shine. Seize the time, therefore, ere the glory of the divine springtime bath spent itself, and the Bird of Eternity ceased to warble its melody, that thy inner hearing may not be deprived of hearkening unto its call. This is My counsel unto thee and unto tbe beloved of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him turn thereunto; whosoever wisheth, let him turn away. God, verily, is independent of him and of that which he may see and Witness. 

 These are the melodies, sung by Jesus, Son of Mary, in accents of majestic power in the Ridvan of the Gospel, revealing those signs that must needs herald the advent of the

Manifestation after Him.   

 In the first Gospel according to Matthew it is recorded: And when they asked Jesus concerning the signs of His coming, He said unto them: "Im-mediately  after the oppression1 of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the earth shall be shaken: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet."2 Rendered  into the Persian tongue,3 the purport of these words is as follows: When the oppression  and afflictions that are to befall rnankind will have come to pass, then shall the sun be withheld from shining, the moon from giving light, the stars of heaven shall fall upon the earth, and the pillars of the earth shall quake. 

 At that time, the signs of the Son of man shall appear in heaven, that is, the promised Beauty and Substance of life shall, when these signs have appeared, step forth out of the realm of the invisible into the visible world, And He saith: at that time, all the peoples and kindreds that dwell on earth shall bewail and lament, and they shall see that divine Beauty coming from heaven, riding upon the clouds with power, grandeur, and magnificence, sending His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. Similarly, in the three other Cospels, according  to Luke, Mark, and John, the same statements are recorded. As We have referred at length to these in Our Tablets revealed in the Arabic tongue, We have made no mention of them in these pages, and have confined Ourselves to but one reference. 

 Inasmuch as the Christian divines have failed to apprehend the meaning of these words, and did not recognize their object and purpose, and have clung to the literal interpretation of the words of Jesus, they therefore became deprived of the streaming grace of the Mu1~ammadan Revelation and The Greek word used (Thlipsis) has two meanings:  pressure and oppression. 
2Matthew 24:2931.         

 The passage is quoted by Baha'u'llah in Arabic and interpreted in Persian. 
its showering bounties.    

 The ignorant among the Christian community, following the example of the leaders of their faith, were likewise prevented from beholding the beauty of the King of glory, inasmuch as those signs which were to accompany the dawn of the sun of the Muhammadan Dispensation  did not actually come to pass. 

 Thus, ages have passed and centuries roiled away, and that most pure Spirit hath repaired unto the retreats of its ancient sovereignty. 

 Once more hath the eternal Spirit breathed into the mystic trumpet, and caused the dead to speed out of their sepulchres of heedlessness  and error unto the realm of guidance and grace. And yet, that expectant community  still crieth out: \Vhen slidi these things be? When shall the promised One, the object of our expectation, be made manifest, that we may arise for the triumph of His Cause, that we may sacrifice our substance  for His sake, that we may offer up our lives in His path? 

 In like manner, have such false imaginings caused other communities  to stray from the Kawthar of the infinite mercy of Providence, and to be busied with their own idle thoughts. 

 Beside this passage, there is yet another verse in the Gospel wherein He saith: c(Heaven and earth shall pass away: but My words shall not pass away."4 Thus it is that the adherents of Jesus maintained that the law of the Gospel shall never be annulled, and that whensoever the promised Beauty is made manifest and all the signs are revealed, He must needs reaffirm and establish the law proclaimed in the Gospel, so that there may remain in the world no faith but His faith. This is their fundamental belief. And their conviction is such that were a person to be made manifest with all the promised signs and to promulgate that which is contrary  to the letter of the law of the Gospel, they must assuredly renounce him, refuse to submit to his law, declare him an infidel, and laugh him to scorn. This is proved by that which came to pass when the sun of the Muhammadan Revelation was revealed. Had they sought with a humble mind from the Manifestations of God in every Dispensation the true meaning of these words re'Luke  21:33.

  vealed in the sacred books — words the misapprehension  of which hath caused men to be deprived of the recognition of the Sadratu'1-Muntah~, the ultimate Purpose —  they surely would have been guided to the light of the Sun of Truth, and would have discovered the mysteries of divine knowledge and wisdom. 
                           
 LOOK WITH MINE OWN E~rs    

  If it be your wish, 0 people, to know God and to discover the greatness of His might, look, then, upon Me with Mine own eyes, and not with the eyes of any one besides  Me. 

 Ye will, otherwise, be never capable of recognizing Me, though ye ponder My Cause as long as My Kingdom en-dureth,  and meditate upon all created things throughout the eternity of God, the Sovereign  Lord of all, the Omnipotent, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Wise. Thus have We manifested the truth of Our Revelation, that haply the people may be roused from their heedlessness, and be of them that understand. 

 Behold the low estate of these men who know full well how I have offered up Mine own Self and My kindred in the path of God and for the preservation of their faith in Him, who are well aware how Mine enemies have compassed Me about, in the days when the hearts of men feared and trembled, the days when they hid themselves from the eyes of the loved ones of God and of His enemies, and were busied in ensuring their own security and peace. 

 We eventually succeeded in manifesting the Cause of God, and exalted it to so eminent  a position that all the people, except those who cherished ill-will in their hearts against this Youth and joined partners with the Almighty, acknowledged the sovereignty of God and His mighty dominion. 

 And yet, notwithstanding this Revelation whose influence  bath pervaded all created things, and despite the brightness of this Light, the like of which none of them bath ever beheld, witness how the people of the Bayin have denied and contended with Me. 

 Some have turned away from the Path of God, rejected the authority of Him in Wham they had believed, and acted insolently towards God, the Most 

Powerful, the Supreme      

 Protector, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Others hesitated and halted in His Path, and regarded the Cause of the Creator, in its inmost  truth, as invalid unless substantiated by the approval of him who was created through the operation of My Will. 

 Thus have their works come to naught, and yet they failed to perceive it. Among them is he who sought to measure God with the measure  of his own self, and was so misled by the names of God as to rise up against Me, who condemned Me as one that deserved to be put to death, and who imputed to Me the very offenses of which he himself was guilty. 

 Wherefore, do I plead My grief and My sorrow to Him Who created Me and entrusted  Me with His Message. Unto Him do I render thanks and praise for the things He hath ordained, for My loneliness, and the anguish I suffer at the hands of these men who have strayed so far from Him. I have patiently sustained, and will continue to sustain, tEe tribulation that touched Me, and will put My whole trust and confidence in God. Him will I supplicate saying: Guide Thy servants, 0 My Lord, unto the court of Thy favor and bounty, and suffer them not to be deprived of the wonders of Thy grace and of Thy manifold blessings. For they know not what Thou hast ordained for them by virtue of Thy mercy that en-compasseth the whole of creation. 

 Outwardly,  0 Lord, they arc weak and helpless; inwardly  they are but orphans. Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Munificent, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Cast not, 0 My God, the fury of Thy wrath upon them, and cause them to tarry until such time when the wonders of Thy mercy will have been made manifest, that haply they may return unto Thee, and ask forgiveness of Thee for the things they have committed against Thee. 

 Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the All-Merciful. 

 Say: Doth it beseem a man while claiming to be a follower of his Lord, the All-Merci-ful, he should yet in his heart do the very deeds of the Evil One? Nay, it ill beseemeth him, and to this He Who is the Beauty of the All-Glorious will bear Me witness. 

 Would that ye could comprehend it!

  remembrance except His remembrance, from your entire being whatsoever may deter you from beholding His face, or may tempt you to follow the promptings of your evil and corrupt inclinations. Let God be your fear, o people, and be ye of them that tread the path of righteousness. 

 Say:     Should your conduct, 0 people, contradict your professions, how think ye, then, to be able to distinguish yourselves from them who, though professing their faith in the Lord their God, have, as soon as He came unto them in the cloud of holiness, refused to acknowledge Him, and repudiated His truth? 

 Disencumber yourselves of all attachment to this world and the vanities thereof. 

 Beware that ye approach them not, inasmuch as they prompt you to walk after your own lusts and covetous desires, and hinder you from entering the straight and glorious 

Path.                      

 Know ye that by "the world" is meant your unawareness of Him Who is your Maker, and your absorption in aught else but Him. The 'life to come," on the other band, signifieth the things that give you a safe approach to God, the All-Glorious, the Incomparable. Whatsoever deterreth you, in this Day, from loving God is nothing but the world. 

 Flee it, that ye may be numbered  with the blest. Should a man wish to adorn himself with the ornaments of the earth, to wear its apparels, or partake of the benefits it can bestow, no harm can befall him, if he alloweth nothing whatever to intervene between him and God, for God hath ordained every good thing, whether created in the heavens or in the earth, for such of His servants as truly believe in Him. 

 Eat ye, 0 people, of the good things which God hath allowed you, and deprive not yourselves from His wondrous bounties. Render thanks and praise unto him, and be of them that are truly thankful. 

 0     thou that hast fled thy home and sought the presence of God! Proclaim unto men the Message of thy Lord, that it may haply deter theffi from following the promptings of their evil and corrupt desires, and bring them to the remembrance of God, the 

Most Exalted, the Most     

 Great. Say: Fear God, 0 people, and refrain from shedding the blood of any one. Contend not with your neighbor,  and be ye of them that do good. Beware  that ye commit no disorders on the earth after it hath been well ordered, and follow not the footsteps of them that are gone astray. 

 Whoso ariseth among you to teach the Cause of his Lord, let him, before all else, teach his own self, that his speech may attract  the hearts of them that hear him. 

 Unless  he teacheth his own self, the words of his mouth will not influence the heart of the seeker. 

 Take heed, 0 people, lest ye be of them that give good counsel to others but forget to follow it themselves. The words of such as these, and beyond the words the realities of all things, and beyond these realities the angels that are nigh unto God, bring against them the accusation of falsehood. 

 Should such a man ever succeed in influencing any one, this success should be attributed not to him, but rather to the influence of the words of God, as decreed by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise. In the sight of God he is regarded as a lamp that imparteth its light, and yet is all the while being consumed within itself. 

 Say: Commit not, 0 people, that which will bring shame upon you or dishonor the Cause of God in the eyes of men, and be not of the mischief-makers. 

 Approach not the things which your minds condemn. 

 Eschew all manner of wickedness, for such things are forbidden unto you in the Book which none touch except such as God hath cleansed from every taint of guilt, and numbered among the purified. 

 Be fair to yourselves and to others, that the evidences of justice may be revealed, through your deeds, among Our faithful servants. Beware lest ye encroach upon the substance of your neighbor. Prove yourselves worthy of his trust and confidence in you, and withhold not from the poor the gifts which the grace of God bath bestowed upon you. He, verily, shall recompense the charitable, and doubly repay them for what they have bestowed. 
No God is there but Him.   

 All creation and its empire are His.

  He bestoweth His gifts on whom He will, and from whom He will He withholdeth them. 

 He is the Great Giver, the Most Generous,  the 

Benevolent.                

 Say:     Teach ye the Cause of God, 0 people of Baha, for God hath prescribed unto every one the duty of proclaiming His Message, and regardeth it as the most meritorious of all deeds. 

 Such a deed is acceptable only when he that teacheth the Cause is already a firm believer in God, the Supreme Protector, the Gracious, the Almighty. 

 He hath, moreover, ordained that His Cause be taught through the power of men's utterance,  and not through resort to violence. Thus hath His ordinance been sent down from the Kingdom of Him Who is the Most Exalted, the All — Wise. Beware lest ye contend  with any one, nay, strive to make him aware of the truth with kindly manner and most convincing exhortation. If your hearer respond, he will have responded to his own behoof, and if not, turn ye away from him, and set your faces towards God's sacred Court, the seat of resplendent holiness. 

 Dispute not with any one concerning the things of this world and its affairs, for God hath abandoned them to such as have set their affection upon them. Out of the whole world He bath chosen for Himself the hearts of men — hearts which the hosts of revelation and of utterance can subdue. 

 Thus hath it been ordained by the Fingers of Baha, upon the Tablet of God's irrevocable decree, by the behest of Him Who is the Supreme Ordainer, the All-Knowing. 

 0     wayfarer in the path of God! Take thou thy portion of the ocean of His grace, and deprive not thyself of the things that lie hidden in its depths. Be thou of them that have partaken of its treasures.. A dewdrop out of this ocean would, if shed upon all that are in the heavens and on the earth, suffice to enrich them with the bounty of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. With the hands of renunciation draw forth from its life-giving waters, and sprinkle therewith all created things, that they may be cleansed from all manmade limitations and may approach the mighty seat of God, this hallowed and resplendent Spot. 

 Be not grieved if thou performest it thyself alone. Let God be all-sufficient for thee. Commune intimately with His Spirit, and be thou of the thankful. 

 Proclaim the Cause of thy Lord unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth. Should any man respond to thy call, lay bare before him the pearls of the wisdom of the Lord, thy God, which His Spirit hath sent down unto thee, and be thou of them that truly believe. And should any one reject thine offer, turn thou away from hiffi, and put thy trust and confidence  in the Lord, thy God, the Lord of all worlds. 

 By the righteousness of God! Whoso openeth his lips in this Day and maketh mention  of the name of his Lord, the hosts of Divine inspiration shall descend upon him from the heaven of My name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. On him shall also descend the Concourse on high, each bearing aloft a chalice of pure light. Thus hath it been foreordained in the realm of God's Revelation, by the behest of Him Who is the All-Glorious, the 

Most Powerful.             

 There lay concealed within the Holy Veil, and prepared for the service of God, a company  of His chosen ones who shall be manifested unto men, who shall aid His Cause, who shall be afraid of no one, though the entire human race rise up and war against them. 

 These are the ones who, before the gaze of the dwellers on earth and the denizens  of heaven, shall arise and, shouting aloud, acclaim the name of the Almighty, and summon the children of men to the path of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. Walk thou in their way, and let no one dismay thee. Be of them whom the tumult of the world, however much it may agitate them in the path of their Creator, can never sadden, whose purpose the blame of the blamer will never defeat. 

 Go forth with the Tablet of God and His signs, and rejoin them that have believed in Me, and announce unto them tidings of Our most hoiy Paradise.

EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS        111

  I carry the testimony of God, your Lord and the Lord of your sires of old. Weigh it with the just Balance that ye possess, the Balance of the testimony of the 

Prophets and Messengers    

 of God. If ye find it to be established  in truth, if ye believe it to be of God, beware, then, lest ye cavil at it, and render your works vain, and be numbered with the infidels. It is indeed the sign of God that hath been sent down through the power of truth, through which the validity of His Cause hath been demonstrated unto His creatures, and the ensigns of purity lifted up betwixt earth and heaven. 

 Say:     This is the sealed and mystic Scroll, the repository of God's irrevocable Decree, bearing the words which the Finger of Holiness bath traced, that lay wrapt within the veil of impenetrable mystery, and hath now been sent down as a token of the grace of Him Who is the Almighty, the Ancient of Days. In it have We decreed the destinies of all the dwellers of the earth and the denizens  of heaven, and written down the knowledge  of all things from first to last. Nothing whatsoever can escape or frustrate Him, whether created in the past or to be created in the future, could ye but perceive it. Say:     The Revelation sent down by God hath most surely been repeated, and the outstretched Hand of Our power hath overshadowed  all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth. 

 We have, through the power of truth, the very truth, manifested  an infinitesimal glimmer of Our impenetrable Mystery, and lo, they that have recognized the radiance of the Sinaic splendor expired, as they caught a lightening glimpse of this Crimson Light enveloping the Sinai of Our Revelation. 

 Thus hath He Who is the Beauty of the All-Merciful come down in the clouds of His testimony, and the decree accomplished by virtue of the Will of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise. 

 Say:     Step out of Thy holy chamber, 0 Maid of Heaven, inmate of the Exalted Paradise! 

 Drape thyself in whatever manner  pleaseth Thee in the silken Vesture of Immortality, and put on, in the name of the All-Glorious, the broidered Robe of Light. Hear, then, the sweet, the wondrous accent of the Voice that cometh from the Throne of Thy Lord, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Unveil Thy face, and manifest the beauty of the black-eyed Damsel, and suffer not the servants of God to be deprived  of the light of Thy shining countenance. 

 Grieve not if Thou hearest the sighs of the dwellers of the earth, or the voice of the lamentation of the denizens of heaven. Leave them to perish on the dust of extinction.  Let them be reduced to nothingness, inasmuch as the flame of hatred hath been kindled within their breasts. Intone, then, before the face of the peoples of earth and heaven, and in a most melodious voice, the anthem of praise, for a remembrance of Him Who is the King of the names and attributes of God. Thus have We decreed Thy destiny. 'Well able are We to achieve Our purpose. 

 Beware that Thou divest not Thyself, Thou Who art the Essence of Purity, of Thy robe of effulgent glory. Nay, enrich Thyself increasingly, in the kingdom of creation, with the incorruptible vestures of Thy God, that the beauteous image of the Almighty  may be reflected through Thee in all created things and the grace of Thy Lord be infused in the plenitude of its power into the entire creation. 

 If Thou smellest from any one the smell of the iove of Thy Lord, offer up Thyself for him, for We have created Thee to this end, and have covenanted with Thee, from time immemorial, and in the presence of the congregation of Our well-favored ones, for this very purpose. 

 Be not impatient if the blind in heart hurl down the shafts of their idle far?cies upon Thee. Leave them to themselves, for they follow the promptings of the evil ones. 

 Cry out before the gaze of the dwellers of heaven and of earth: I am the Maid of Heaven, the Offspring begotten by the Spirit of Baha. My habitation is the Mansion of His Name, the All-Glorious. Before the Concourse on high I was adorned with the ornament of His names. I was wrapt within the veil of an inviolable security, and lay hidden from the eyes of men. Methinks that I heard a Voice of divine and incomparable sweetness, proceeding from the right hand

WORDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA

   THE BIRTH OF CHRIST        
                           
     Question. — How was Christ   
born of the Holy Spirit?   

 Answer. — In regard to this question, theologians and materialists disagree. 

 The theologians  believe that Christ was born of the Holy Spirit; but the materialists think this is impossible and inadmissible, and that without  doubt he had a human father. 
 in the Qur'an it is said:  

"And We sent Our Spirit    

 unto her, and he appeared unto her in the shape of a perfect man,"1 meaning that the Holy Spirit took the likeness of the human form, as an image is produced in a mirror, and he addressed Mary. 

 The materialists believe that there must be marriage, and say that a living body cannot  be created from a lifeless body, and without male and female there cannot be fecundation. 

 And they think that not only with man, but also with animals and plants, it is impossible. For this union of the male and female exists in all living beings and plants. 

 This pairing of things is even shown forth in the Qur'an: "Glory be to Him who has created all the pairs: of such things as the earth produceth, and of themselves; and of things which they know not."2 That is to say, men, animals, and plants are all in pairs~tcand of everything have we created two kinds." That is to say, we have created all the beings through pairing. 

 Briefly, then say a man without a human father cannot be imagined. In answer the theoIo~ians say: "This thing is not impossible  and unachievable, but it has not been seen; and there is a great difference between a thing which is impossible and one which is unknown. 

 For example, in former times the telegraph, which causes the East and the West to communicate, was unknown, but not impossible; photography and phonography  were unknown but not impossible." 

  Qur'an, Sun 19. 
     2 Qur'an, Sura 36.         

 The materialists insist upon this belief, and the theologians reply: C(Is this globe eternal or phenomenal?" The materialist answer, that according to science and important  discoveries, it is established that it is phenomenal; in the beginning it was a flaming globe, and gradually it became temperate; a crust was formed around it, and upon this crust plants came into existence, then animals, and finally man. 

 The theologians say: "Then from your statement it has become evident and clear that mankind is phenomenal upon the globe, and not eternal. Then surely the first man had neither father nor mother, for the existence  of man is phenomenal. Is not the creation of man without father and mother, even though gradually, more difficult than if he had simply come into existence without a father? As you admit that the first man came into existence without father or mother — whether it be gradually or at once — there can remain no doubt that a man without a human father is also possible and admissible; you cannot consider this impossible; otherwise you are illogical. 

 For example,  if you say that this lamp has once been lighted without wick and oil, and then say that it is impossible to light it without the wick, this is illogical." 

 Christ had a mother; the first man, as the materialists believe, had neither father nor mother.3 
                           
THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST    
Is DUE TO                  
                           
     His PERFECTIONS            

  A great man is a great man, whether born of a human father or not. 

 If being without a father is a virtue, Adam is greater and more excellent than all the Prophets and Messengers, for he had neither father nor mother. 

 That which causes honour and This conversation shows the uselessness of discussions upon such questions; the teachings of 'Abdu'l-Baha upon the birth of Christ will be found in the following chapter. 
113


<p114>
114             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  greatness, is the splendour and bounty of the divine perfections. The sun is born from substance and form, which can be compared to father and mother, and it is absolute perfection;  but the darkness has neither substance nor form, neither father nor mother, and it is absolute imperfection. 

 The substance  of Adam's physical life was earth, but the substance of Abraham was pure sperm; it is certain that the pure and chaste sperm is superior to earth. 

 Furthermore, in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, verses 12 and 13, it is said: ttBut as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believed on his name. 

 ccWhich were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of 

God."                     

 From these verses it is obvious that the being of a disciple also is nor created by physical power, but by the spiritual reality. The honour and greatness of Christ is not due to the fact that he did not have a human father, but to his perfections, bounties, and divine glory. 

 If the greatness of Christ is his being fatherless, then Adam is greater than Christ, for he had neither father nor mother. It is said in the Old Testament, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soui."1 Observe that it is said that Adam came into existence from the Spirit of life. Moreover, the expression which John uses in regard to the disciples, proves that they also are from the Heavenly Father. 

 Hence it is evident that the holy reality, meaning the real existence of every great man, comes from God, and owes its being to the breath of the Holy 

Spirit.                   

 The purport is that, if to be without a human father is the greatest human glory, then Adam is greater than all, for he had neither father nor mother. Is it better for a man to be created from a living substance or from earth? Certainly it is better if be be created from a living substance. But Christ was born and came into existence from the Holy 

Spirit.                   

 To conclude: the splendour and honour of the holy souis and the Divine Manifesta-Gen.  ii. 7. 

 dons come from their heavenly perfections, bounties, and glory, and from nothing else. 
                          
  THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST     

  Question. — It is said in the Gospel of St. Matthew, chapter 3 verses 13, 14, 15: c~Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbade  him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becorneth us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him." 

 What is the wisdom of this: since Christ possessed all essential perfection, why did he need baptism? 

 Anssver. — The principle of baptism is purification by repentance. John admonished and exhorted the people, and caused them to repent, then he baptized them. 

 Therefore it is apparent that this baptism is a symbol of repentance from all sin: its meaning is expressed  in these words: ~ God! as my body has become purified and cleansed from physical  impurities, in the same way purify and sanctify my spirit from the impurities of the world of nature, which are nor worthy of the 

Threshold of Thy Unity!"  

 Repentance is the return from disobedience to obedience. Man, after remoteness and deprivation from God, repents, and undergoes purification: and this is a symbol signifying ttQ God! make my heart good and pure, freed and sanctified from all save thy iove." 

 As Christ desired that this institution of John should be used at that time by all, he himself conformed to it in order to awaken the people and to complete the law of the former religion. 

 Although the ablution of repentance was the institution of John, it was in reality formerly practised in the Religion of God. 

 Christ was not in need of baptism; but as at that time it was an acceptable and praiseworthy action, and a sign of the glad tidings of the Kingdom, therefore be confirmed  it. However, afterwards he said the true baptism is not with material water, but it must be with spirit and with water. In this case water does not signify material water, for elsewhere it is explicitly said baptism is with spirit and with fire; from which it is clear that the reference is not


<p115>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS        115

  to material fire and material water, for baptism with fire is impossible. 

 Therefore the spirit is the bounty of God, the water is knowledge and life, and the fire is the love of God. For material water does not purify the heart of man: no, it cleanses his body; but the heavenly water and spirit, which are knowledge and life, make the human heart good and pure; the heart which receives a portion of the bounty of the Spirit becomes sanctified, good, and pure. That is to say, the reality of man becomes purified and sanctified from the impurities of the world of nature. These natural impurities are evil qualities: anger, passion, worldliness, pride, lying, hypocrisy, fraud, self-love, etc. Man cannot free himself from the rage of the carnal passions except by the help of the Holy Spirit. 

 That is why he says baptism with the spirit, with water, and with fire is necessary, and that it is essential; that is to say, the spirit of divine bounty, the water of knowledge and life, and the fire of the love of God. Man must be baptized with this spirit, this water, and this fire so as to become filled with the eternal bounty. Otherwise,  what is the use of baptizing with material  water? 

 No, this baptism with water was a symbol of repentance, and of seeking forgiveness of sins. 

 But in the cycle of Baha'u'llah there is no longer need of this symbol; for its reality, which is to be baptized with the Spirit and Love of God, is understood and established. 
                           
THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM   

  Question. — Is the ablution of baptism useful  and necessary, or is it useless and unnecessary?  In the first case, if it is useful, why was it abrogated, and in the second case, if it is useless, why did John practise it? 

 Answer. — The change in conditions, alterations,  and transformations; are necessities of the essence of beings; and essential necessities cannot be separated from the reality of things. 

 So it is absolutely impossible to separate heat from fire, humidity from water, or light from the sun, for they are essential necessities. 

 As the change and alteration of conditions are necessities for beings, so laws also are changed and altered, in accordance with the changes aixd alterations of the times. For example, in the time of Moses, his Law was conformed and adapted to the conditions of the time; but in the days of Christ these conditions had changed and altered to such an extent that the Mosaic Law was no longer suited and adapted to the needs of mankind, and it was therefore abrogated. 

 Thus it was that Christ broke the Sabbath and forbade divorce. After Christ, four disciples, among whom were Peter and Paul, permitted the use of animal food forbidden by the Bible, except the eating of those animals which had been strangled, or which were sacrificed to idols, and of blood.' 
They also forbade fornication. 

 They maintained these four commandments.  Afterwards Paul permitted even the eating of strangled animals, those sacrificed  to idols, and blood, and oniy maintained the prohibition of fornication. 

 So in chap. 14 verse 14 of his Epistle to the Romans,  Paul writes: ccj know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteerneth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean." 

 Also in the Epistle of Paul to Titus, chap. I verse 15: 'tUnto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled." 

 Now this change, these alterations, and this abrogation are due to the impossibility of comparing the time of Christ with that of Moses. The conditions and requirements in the later period were entirely changed and altered. The former laws were therefore abrogated. 

 The existence of the world may be compared  to that of a man, and the Prophets and Messengers of God to skilful doctors. The human being cannot remain in one condition:  different maladies occur which have each a special remedy. 

 The skilful physician does not give the same medicine to cure each disease and each malady, but he changes remedies and medicines according to the different necessities of the diseases and constitutions. 

 One person may have a severe illness caused by fever, and the skilled doctor will give him cooling remedies; and when at some other time the condition of this person has changed, and fever is replaced by chills, without doubt the skilled doctor will dis-'Acts  xv. 20.


<p116>
116             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  card cooling medicine and permit the use of heating drugs; this change and alteration is required by the condition of the patient, and is an evident proof of the skill of the physician. 

 Consider, could the Law of the Old Testament be enforced at this epoch and time? No, in the name of God! it would be impossible and impracticable; therefore most certainly God abrogated the laws of the Old Testament at the time of Christ. 

 Reflect also, that baptism in the days of John the Baptist was used to awaken and admonish the people to repent from all sin, and to watch for the appearance of the Kingdom of Christ. 

 But at present in Asia, the Catholics  and the Orthodox Church plunge newly-born children into water mixed with olive oil, and many of them become ill from the shock; at the time of baptism they struggle and become agitated. 

 In other places, the clergy sprinkle the water of baptism  on the forehead. 

 But neither from the first form nor from the second do the children  derive any spiritual benefit. 

 Then what result is obtained from this form? Other peoples are amazed, and wonder why the infant is plunged into the water, since this is neither the cause of the spiritual awakening of the child, nor of its faith or conversion, but it is oniy a custom which is followed.  In the time of John the Baptist it was not so; no, at first John used to exhort the people, and to guide them to repentance from sin, and to fill them with the desire to await the manifestation of Christ. 'Whoever  received the ablution of baptism, and repented of sins in absolute humility and meekness, would also purify and cleanse his body from outward impurities. With perfect  yearning, night and day, he would constantly wait for the manifestation of Christ, and the entrance to the Kingdom of the Spirit of God.1 

 To recapitulate: our meaning is that the change and modification of conditions, and the altered requirements of different centuries and times, are the cause of the abrogation  of laws. For a time comes when these laws are no longer suitably adapted to conditions. Consider how very different are 'i.e. of Christ, whom the Muslims frequently designate  by the title of Riihu'lldh, the Spirit of God. 

 the requirements of 'the first centuries, of the middle ages, and of modern times. 

 Is it possible that the laws of the first centuries could be enforced at present? 

 It is evident that it would be impossible and impracticable.  In the same manner, after the lapse of a few centuries, the requirements of the present time will not be the same as those of the future, and certainly there will be change and alteration. 

 In Europe the laws are unceasingly altered and modified; in bygone years, how many laws existed in the organisations and systems of Europe, which are now abrogated! These changes and alterations are due to the variation and mutation of thought, conditions, and customs. 

 If it were not so, the prosperity of the world of humanity would be wrecked. 

 For example, there is in the Pentateuch a law that if any one break the Sabbath, he shall be put to death. Moreover, there are ten sentences of death in the Pentateuch. Would it be possible to keep these laws in our time? 

 It is clear that it would be absolutely  impossible. 

 Consequently there are changes and modifications in the laws, and these are a sufficient proof of the supreme wisdom of 

God.                       

 This subject needs deep thought. Then the cause of these changes will be evident and apparent. 

 Blessed are those who reflect! 
                           
THE SYMBOLISM OF THE BREAD 
                           
       AND THE WINE               

  Question. — The Christ said: CC~ am the living bread which came down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die." What is the meaning of this utterance? 

 Answer. — This bread signifies the heavenly food and divine perfections. So, "Jf any man eateth of this bread" means if any man acquires  heavenly bounty, receives the divine light, or partakes of Christ's perfections, he thereby gains everlasting life. The blood also signifies the spirit of life and the divine perfections, the lordly splendour and eternal bounty. For all the members of the body gain vital substance from the circulation of the blood. 

 In the Gospel of St. John, chapter 6 verse 26, it is written: "Ye seek me, not because ye


<p117>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS         117

  saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled." 

 It is evident that the bread of which the disciples ate and were filled, was the heavenly bounty; for in verse 33 of the same chapter it is said: "For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world." 

 It is clear that the body of Christ did not descend from heaven, but it came from the womb of Mary; and that which descended from the heaven of God was the spirit of Christ. As the Jews thought that Christ spoke of his body, they made objections, for it is said in the 42nd verse of the same chapter: ccAnd they said, Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? 

 how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?" 

 Reflect how clear it is that what Christ meant by the heavenly bread w~s his spirit, his bounties, his perfections, and his teachings;  for it is said in the 63rd verse: "It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing." 

 Therefore it is evident that the spirit of Christ is a heavenly grace which descends from heaven; whosoever receives light from that spirit in abundance, that is to say the heavenly teachings, finds everlasting life. That is why it is said in the 35th verse: "And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst:" Notice that "coming to him" he expresses as eating, and "belief in him" as drinking. Then it is evident and established that the celestial food is the divine bounties, the spiritual splendours, the heavenly teachings, the universal meaning of Christ. To eat is to draw near to him, and to drink is to believe in him. 

 For Christ had an elemental body and a celestial form. 

 The elemental body was crucified, but the heavenly form is living and eternal, and the cause of everlasting life; the first was the human nature, and the second is the divine nature. 

 It is thought by some that the Eucharist is the reality of Christ, and that the Divinity and the Holy Spirit descend into and exist in it. Now when once the Eucharist is taken, after a few moments it is simply disintegrated, and entirely transformed. Therefore how can such a thought be conceived? 

 God forbid! certainly it is an absolute fantasy. 

 To conclude: through the manifestation of Christ, the divine teachings which are an eternal bounty, were spread abroad, the light of guidance shone forth, and the spirit of life was conferred on man. 

 Whoever found guidance became living, whoever remained  lost was seized by enduring death. This bread which came down from. heaven was the divine body of Christ, his spiritual elements, which the disciples ate, and through which they gained eternal life. 

 The disciples had taken many meals from the hand of Christ; why was the last supper distinguished from the others? It is evident that the heavenly bread did not signify this material bread, but rather the divine nourishment of the spiritual body of Christ, the divine graces and heavenly perfections of which• his disciples partook, and with which they became filled. 

 In the same way, reflect that when Christ blessed the bread and gave it to his disciples saying, CCThis is my body," and gave grace to them, he was with them in person, in presence,  and form. 

 He was not transformed into bread and wine; if he had been turned into bread and wine, he could not have remained  with the disciples in body, in person, and in presence. 

 Then it is clear that the bread and wine were symbols which signified: I have given you my bounties and perfections, and when you have received this bounty, you have gained eternal life and have partaken of your share and your portion of the heavenly nourishment. 
                          
         MIRACLES                  

  Question. — It is recorded that miracles were performed by Christ: are the reports of these miracles really to be accepted literally, or have they another meaning? 

 It has been proved by exact science that the essence of things does not change, and that all beings are under one universal law and organisation from which they cannot deviate; and therefore  that which is contrary to universal law is impossible. 

   Answer. — The Holy Manifestations

 are the sources of miracles and the originators of wonderful signs. For them, any difficult and


<p118>
118             THE  BAHA'I  WORLD

  impracticable thing is possible and easy. For through a supernatural power wonders appear  from them, and by this power, which is beyond nature, they influence the world of nature. 

 From all the Manifestations marvel-bus  things have appeared. 

 But in the Holy Books an especial terminology is employed; and for the Manifestations  these miracles and wonderful signs have no importance; they do not even wish to mention them. For, if we consider miracles a great proof, they are still only proofs and arguments for those who are present when they are performed, and not for those who are absent. 

 For example, if we relate to a seeker, a stranger to Moses and Christ, marvellous signs, he will deny them and will say: "Won-derful  signs are also continually related of false gods by the testimony of many people, and they are affirmed in the Books. 

 The Brahmans have written a book about wonderful prodigies from Brahma." 

 He will also say: ttHow can we know that the Jews and the Christians speak the truth, and that the Brahmans tell a lie? For both are generally admitted traditions, which are collected in books, and may be supposed to be true or false." The same may be said of other religions:  if one is true, all are true; if one is accepted, all must be accepted. Therefore miracles are not a proof. For if they are proofs for those who are present, they fail as proofs to those who are absent. 

 But in the day of the Manifestation the people with insight see that all the conditions of the Manifestation are miracles, for they are superior to all others, and this alone is an absolute miracle. Recollect that Christ, solitary  and alone, without a helper or protector, without armies and legions, and under the greatest oppression, uplifted the standard of God before all the people of the world, and withstood them, and finally conquered all, although outwardly he was crucified. 

 Now this is a veritable miracle which can never be denied. There is no need of any other proof of the truth of Christ. 

 The outward miracles have no importance for the people of Reality. If a blind man receive sight, for example, he will finally again become sightless, for he will die, and be deprived of all his senses and powers. 

 Therefore causing the blind man to see is comparatively of little importance, for this faculty of sight will at last disappear. 

 If the body of a dead person be resuscitated, of what use is it since the body will die again? 

 But it is important to give perception  and eternal life, that is, the spiritual and divine life. For this physical life is not immortal,  and its existence is equivalent to nonexistence. 

 So it is that Christ said to one of his disciples: "Let the dead bury their dead"; for ttThat which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.~~ Observe: those who in appearance were physically alive, Christ considered dead; for life is the eternal life, and existence is the real existence. 

 Wherever in the Holy Books they speak of raising the dead, the meaning is that the dead were blessed by eternal life; where it is said that the blind received sight, the signification is that he obtained the true perception; where it is said a deaf man received  hearing, the meaning is that he acquired spiritual and heavenly hearing. This is ascertained from the text of the Gospel where Christ said: CcTh are like those of whom Isaiah said, They have eyes and see not, they have ears and hear not; and I healed them." 

 The meaning is not that the Manifestations  are unable to perform miracles, for they have all power. 

 But for them inner sight, spiritual healing, and eternal life are the valuable and important things. 

 Consequently,  whenever it is recorded in the Holy Books that such an one was blind and recovered his sight, the meaning is that he was inwardly blind, and that he obtained spiritual vision, or that he was ignorant and became wise, or that he was negligent and became heedful, or that he was worldly and became heavenly. 

 As this inner sight, hearing, life, and healing  are eternal, they are of importance. What, comparatively, is the importance, the value, and the worth of this animal life with its powers? 

 In a few d~ys it will cease like fleeting thoughts. 

 For example, if one relights an extinguished lamp, it will again become extinguished; but the light of the sun is always luminous. This is of importance.

THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST 

  Question. — What is the meaning of Christ's resurrection after three days? 

 Ansiver. — The resurrections of the Divine Manifestations are not of the body. 

 All their states, their conditions, their acts, the things they have established, their teachings, their expressions, their parables, and their instructions have a spiritual and divine signification, and have no connection with material things. 

 For example, there is the subject of Christ's coming from heaven: it is clearly stated in many places in the Gospel that the Son of man came from heaven, he is in heaven, and he will go to heaven. 

 So in chapter 6 verse 38 of the Gospel of John it is written: ccFor I came down from heaven"; and also in verse 42 we find: "And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?" Also in John, chapter 3 verse 13: "And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven." 

 Observe that it is said CCTh Son of man is in heaven," while at that time Christ was on earth. 

 Notice also that it is said that Christ came from heaven, though he came from the womb of Mary, and his body was born of Mary. It is clear, then, that when it is said that the Son of man is come from heaven, this has not an outward but an inward signification; it is a spiritual, not a material fact. The meaning is that though, apparently, Christ was born from the womb of Mary, in reality he came from heaven, from the centre of the Sun of Reality, from the Divine World, and the Spiritual Kingdom.  And as it has become evident that Christ came from the spiritual heaven of the Divine Kingdom, therefore his disappearance under the earth for three days has an inner signification, and is not an outward fact. 

 In the same way, his resurrection from the interior of the earth is also symbolical; it is a spiritual and divine fact, and not material; and likewise his ascension to heaven is a spiritual and not material ascension. 

 Beside these explanations, it has been established and proved by science that the visible heaven is a limitless area, void and empty, where innumerable stars and planets revolve. 

 Therefore we say that the meaning of Christ's resurrection is as follows: the disciples  were troubled and agitated after the martyrdom of Christ. The Reality of Christ, which signifies his teachings, his bounties, his perfections, and his spiritual power, was hidden and concealed for two or three days after his martyrdom, and was not resplendent and manifest. 

 No, rather it was lost; for the believers were few in number and were troubled and agitated. The Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body; and, when after three days the disciples became assured and steadfast, and began to serve the Cause of Christ, and resolved to spread the divine teachings, putting his counsels into practice, and arising  to serve him, the Reality of Christ became  resplendent and his bounty appeared; his religion found life, his teachings and his admonitions became evident and visible. 

 In other words, the Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body, until the life and the bounty of the Holy Spirit surrounded it. Such is the meaning of the resurrection of Christ, and this was a true resurrection. 

 But as the clergy have neither understood the meaning of the Gospels nor comprehended the symbols, therefore it has been said that religion is in contradiction to science, and science in opposition to religion; as, for example,  this subject of the ascension of Christ with an elemental body to the visible heaven is contrary to the science of mathematics. But when the truth of this subject becomes clear, and the symbol is explained, science in no way contradicts it; but, on the contrary, science and the intelligence affirm it. 

THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY    
SPIRIT                     
                           
    UPON THE APOSTLES          

  Question. — W hat is the manner, and what is the meaning, of the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, as described in the Gospel? 

 Answer. — The descent of the Holy Spirit is not like the entrance of air into man; it is an expression and a simile, rather than an exact or a literal image. No, rather it is like the entrance of the image of the sun into the mirror; that is to say, its splendour becomes  apparent in it.


<p120>
120             THE ]IAHA'I WORLD

  After the death of Christ the disciples were troubled, and their ideas and thoughts were discordant and contradictory; later, they became firm and united, and at the feast of Pentecost they gathered together, and detached themselves from the things of this world. Disregarding themselves, they renounced their comfort and worldly happiness,  sacrificing their body and soul to the Beloved, abandoning their houses, and becoming wanderers and homeless, even f or-getting  their own existence. Then they received  the help of God, and the power of the Holy Spirit became manifested; the spirituality of Christ triumphed, and the love of God reigned. 

 They were given help at that time, and dispersed in different directions, teaching the Cause of God, and giving forth proofs and evidences. 

 So the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles means their attraction by the Christ Spirit, whereby they acquired stability and firmness. 

 Through the spirit of the love of God they gained a new life, and they saw Christ living, helping, and protecting them. They were like drops and they became seas, they were like feeble insects and they became majestic eagles, they were weak and became powerful. 

 They were like mirrors facing the sun; verily, some ot the light became manifest  in them. 
                          
     THE HOLY SPIRIT           

  Question. — What is the Holy 

Spirit?                   
    Anstver. — The Holy Spirit  

 is the Bounty of God, and the luminous rays which emanate  from the Manifestations; for the focus of the rays of the Sun of Reality was Christ; and from this glorious focus, which is the Reality of Christ, the Bounty of God reflected  upon the other mirrors which were the reality of the apostles. 

 The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles signifies that the glorious divine bounties reflected and appeared in their reality. 

 Moreover, entrance and exit, descent and ascent, are characteristics of bodies and not of spirits. That is to say, sensible realities enter and come forth, but intellectual subtleties and mental realities, such as intelligence, love, knowledge, imagination and thought, do not enter, nor come forth, nor descend, but rather they have direct connection. 

 For example, knowledge, which is a state attained to by the intelligence, is an intellectual  condition; and entering and coming out of the mind are imaginary conditions; but the mind is connected with the acquisition  of knowledge, like images reflected in a mirror. 

 Therefore, as it is evident and clear that the intellectual realities do not enter and descend, and it is absolutely impossible that the Holy Spirit should ascend and descend, enter, come out, or penetrate, it can only be that the Holy Spirit appears in splendour, as the sun appears in the mirror. 
     In some passages in the   

Holy Books the Spirit     

 is spoken of, signifying a certain person;  as it is currently said in speech and conversation that such a person is an embodied spirit, or he is a personification of mercy and generosity. 

 In this case it is the light we look at, and not the glass. 

 In the Gospel of John, in speaking of the Promised One who was to come after Christ, it is said in chapter 16, verses 12, 13: ~ have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 

 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak." 

 Now consider carefully that from these words, "for he sWill not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak," it is clear that the Spirit of Truth is embodied  in a man who has individuality, who has ears to hear and a tongue to speak. In the same way the name ttSiit of God" is used in relation to Christ; as you speak of a light — meaning both the light and the lamp. 
                          
THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST
AND                       
                          
   THE DAY OF JUDGMENT       

  It is said in the Holy Books that Christ will come again, and that his coming depends upon the fulfilment of certain signs: when he comes it will be with these signs. For example, CCTh sun will be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power

  and great glory." Baha'u'llah has explained these verses in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn:1 there is no need of repetition: refer to it and you will understand these sayings. 

 But I have something further to say upon this subject. 

 At his first coming also, Christ came from heaven, as it is explicitly stated in the Gospel. Christ himself says: "And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.~~ It is clear to all that Christ came from heaven, although apparently he came from the womb of Mary. At the first coming he came from heaven, though apparently from the womb; in the same way also, at his second coming, he will come from heaven, though apparently from the womb. 

 The conditions that are indicated in the Gospel for the second coming of Christ are the same as those that were mentioned for the first coming, as we before said. 

 The Book of Isaiah announces that the Messiah will conquer the East and the West, and all nations of the world will come under his shadow, that his Kingdom will be established, that he will come from an unknown place, that the sinners will be judged, and that justice will p~cvail to such a degree that the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and the kid, the sucking child and the asp, shall all gather at one spring, and in one meadow, and one dwelling.2 

 The first coming was also under these conditions, though outwardly  none of them came to pass. 

 Therefore  the Jews rejected Christ, and, God forbid! 

 bid! called the Messiah masikb,3 considered him to be the destroyer of the edifice of God, regarded him as the breaker of the Sabbath and the Law, and sentenced him to death. Nevertheless each one of these conditions had a signification that the Jews did not understand: therefore they were debarred from perceiving the truth of Christ. 

 The second coming of Christ also will be in like manner: the signs and conditions which have been spoken of all have meanings,  and are not to be taken literally. Among other things it is said that the stars will fall upon the earth. The stars are endless  and innumerable, and modern mathematicians have established and proved scientifically that the globe of the sun is estimated to be about one million and a half times greater than the earth, and each of the fixed stars to be a thousand times larger than the sun. If these stars were to fall upon the surface of the earth, how could they find place there? It would be as though a thousand million of Himalaya mountains were to fall upon a grain of mustard seed. According to reason and science this thing is quite impossible. 

 What is even more strange is that Christ said: "Perhaps I shall come when you are yet asleep, for the coming of the Son of man is like the coming of a thief." Perhaps the thief will be in the house and the owner will not know it. It is clear and evident that these signs have symbolic signification, and that they are not literal. 

 They are fully explained in the Kitdb-i-Iqdn: refer to it. 

     THE NEED OF DIVINE EDUCATION

  IN THE books of the prophets certain glad-tidings are recorded which are absolutely true and free from doubt. 

 The East has ever been the dawning-point of the Sun of Reality. All the prophets of God have appeared there. The religions of God have 'Kitdb-i-iqdn: one of the first works of JIah&'-u'll4h, written at Eaghd&d, before the declaration of his manifestation. 

 2 In these conversations, as the reader will have already observed, 'Abdu'l-Baha desires rather to indicate the meaning of certain passages of the Scriptures. than to quote the exact text. 

 been promulgated, the teachings of God have been spread and the law of God founded in the East. The Orient has always been the center of lights. The West has acquired illumination from the East but in some respects the reflection of the light has been greater in the Occident. This is especially true of 

Christianity. His Holiness 

 Christ appeared in Palestine and His teachings were Masilzh — Le. the monster. 

 In Arabic there is a play upon the words Masib, the Messiah, and rnasikh, the monster.


<p122>
122              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  founded there. Although the doors of the Kingdom were opened in that country and the bestowals of divinity were spread broadcast from its center, the people of the West have embraced and promulgated Christianity  more fully than those in the East. 

 The Sun of Reality shone forth from the horizon of the East but its heat and ray are most resplendent in the West where the radiant standard of His Holiness Christ has been upraised. 

 I have great hopes that the lights of Baha'u'llah's appearance may also find the fullest manifestation and reflection in these western regions; for the teachings of Baha'u'llah  are especially applicable to the conditions of the people here. The western nations are endowed with the capability of understanding the rational and peerless words of Baha'u'llah and realizing that the essence of the teachings of all the former prophets can be found in His utterance. 

 The teachings of His Holiness Christ have been promulgated by His Holiness BaLi'-u '11Th who has also revealed new teachings applicable to present conditions in the world of humanity. 

 He has trained the people of the East through the power and protection of the Holy Spirit, cemented the souls of humanity together and established the foundations of international unity. 

 Through the power of His words the hearts of the people of all religions have been attuned in harmony. 

 For instance, among the Baha in Persia there are Christians, Muhammadans, Zoroastrians, Jews and many others of varying denominations and beliefs who have been brought together in unity and love in the cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 Although  these people were formerly hostile and antagonistic, filled with hatred and bitterness toward each other, bloodthirsty and pillaging, considering that animosity and attack were the means of attaining the good-pleasure  of God, they have now become iov-ing  and filled with the radiant zeal of fellowship and brotherhood, the purpose of them all being service to the world of humanity,  promotion of international peace, the unification of the divine religions and deeds of universal philanthropy. 

 By their words and actions they are proving the verity of His Holiness Baha'u'llah. 

 Consider the animosity and hatred existing  today between the various nations of the world. What disagreements and hostilities  arise, what warfare and contention, how much bloodshed, what injustice and tyranny! 

 Just now there is war in eastern Turkey, also war between Turkey and Italy. Nations are devoted to conquest and bloodshed, filled with the animus of religious hatred, seeking the good-pleasure of God by killing and destroying those whom they consider enemies in their blindness. 
How ignorant they are!     

 That which is forbidden by God they consider acceptable to Him. God is love; God seeketh fellowship, purity, sanctity and longsuffering; these are the attributes of divinity. Therefore, these warring,  raging nations have arisen against divinity, imagining they are serving God. What gross ignorance this is! What injustice, blindness and lack of realization! Briefly; we must strive with heart and soul in order that this darkness of the contingent world may be dispelled, that the lights of the Kingdom shall shine upon all the horizons, the world of humanity become ii-lumined,  the image of God become apparent in human mirrors, the law of God be well established and that all regions of the world shall enjoy peace, comfort and composure beneath the equitable protection of God. My admonition and exhortation to you is this: Be kind to all people, love humanity, consider all mankind as your relations and servants  of the most high God. Strive day and night that animosity and contention may pass away from the hearts of men, that all religions shall become reconciled and the nations love each other, so that no racial, religious or political prejudice may remain, and the world of humanity behold God as the beginning and end of all existence. God has created all and all return to God. There-fare  love humanity with all your heart and soul. If you meet a poor man, assist him; if you see the sick, heal him; reassure the afirighted one, render the cowardly noble and courageous, educate the ignorant, associate  with the stranger. 

Emulate God. Consider      

 how kindly, how lovingly He deals with all and follow His example. You must treat people in accordance with the divine precepts; in other words, treat them as


<p123>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'{ SACRED WRITINGS        123

  kindly as God treats them, for this is the greatest attainment possible for the world of humanity. 

 Furthermore, know ye that God has created  in man the power of reason whereby man is enabled to investigate reality. God has not intended man to blindly imitate his fathers and ancestors. 

 He has endowed him with mind or the faculty of reasoning by the exercise of which he is to investigate and discover the truth; and that which he finds real and true, he must accept. 

 He must not be an imitator or blind follower of any soul. He must not rely implicitly upon the opinion of any man without investigation; nay, each soui must seek intelligently and independently, arriving at a real conclusion and bound only by that reality. 

 The greatest cause of bereavement and disheartening in the world of humanity is ignorance based upon blind imitation. It is due to this that wars and battles prevail; from this cause hatred and animosity arise continually among mankind. Through failure to investigate  reality the Jews rejected His 

Holiness Jesus Christ.    

 They were expecting His coming;  by day and night they mourned and lamented, saying, "0 God! hasten thou the day of the advent of Christ," expressing most intense longing for the Messiah but when His Holiness Christ appeared they denied  and rejected Him, treated Him with arrogant contempt, sentenced Him to death and finally crucified Him. Why did this happen? 

 Because they were blindly following  imitations, believing that which had descended to them as a heritage from their fathers and ancestors; tenaciously holding to it and refusing to investigate the reality of Christ. Therefore they were deprived of the bounties of His Holiness whereas if they had forsaken imitations and investigated the reality of the Messiah they would have surely been guided to believing in Him. 

 Instead  of this, they said, "We have heard from our fathers and have read in the old testament that His Holiness Christ must come from an unknown place; now we find that this one has come from Nazareth." 

 Steeped in the literal interpretation and imitating the beliefs of fathers and ancestors they failed to understand the fact that although the body of Jesus came from Nazareth, the reality of the Christ came from the unknown place of the divine Kingdom. 

 They also said that the sceptre of His Holiness Christ would be of iron, that is to say He should wield a sword. When His Holiness Christ appeared, He did possess a sword but it was the sword of His tongue with which He separated the false from the true; but the Jews were blind to the spiritual significance and symbolism of the prophetic words. They also expected that the Messiah would sit upon the throne of 

David whereas His Holiness 

 the Christ had neither throne nor semblance of sovereignty; nay, rather, He was a poor man, apparently abject and vanquished; therefore how could He be the veritable Christ? 

 This was one of their most insistent objections based upon ancestral interpretation  and teaching. 

In reality His Holiness   

 Christ was glorified with an eternal sovereignty and everlasting dominion, spiritual  and not temporal. 

 His throne and kingdom were established in human hearts where he reigns with power and authority without end. Notwithstanding the fulfillment of all the prophetic signs in His Holiness, the Jews denied Him and entered the period of their deprivation because of their allegiance to imitations and ancestral forms. 

 Among other objections, they said, "We are promised through the tongue of the prophets that His Holiness Christ at the time of His coining would proclaim the law of the Torah whereas now we see this person abrogating the commands of the pentateuch, disturbing our blessed sabbath and abolishing  the law of divorce. He has left nothing of the ancient law of Moses, therefore He is the enemy of Moses." 

In reality His Holiness  

 Christ proclaimed and completed the law of Moses. 

 He was the very helper and assister of Moses. 

 He spread the book of Moses throughout the world and established anew the fundamentals of the law revealed by him. He abolished certain unimportant laws and forms which were no longer compatible with the exigencies of the time, such as divorce and plurality of wives. 

 The Jews did not comprehend this, and the cause of their ignorance was blind and tenacious adherence to imitations of ancient forms and teachings; therefore they finally sentenced His Holiness to death.


<p124>
124              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  They likewise said, tcThrough the tongues of the prophets it was announced that during  the time of Christ's appearance the justice of God would prevail throughout the world, tyranny and oppression would be unknown,  justice would even extend to the animal kingdom, ferocious beasts would associate in gentleness and peace, the wolf and the Iamb would drink from the same spring, the lion and the deer meet in the same meadow, the eagle and quail dwell together in the same nest; but instead of this, we see that during the time of this supposed Christ the Romans have conquered Palestine and are ruling it with extreme tyranny, jim-tice  is nowhere apparent and signs of peace the kingdom are conspicuously absent." These statements and attitudes of the Jews were inherited from their fathers; blind allegiance  to literal expectations which did not come to pass during the time of Jesus Christ. The real purport of these prophetic statements was that various peoples symbolized by the wolf and Iamb between whom love and fellowship were impossible would come together during Messiah's reign, drink from the same fountain of life in His teachings and become His devoted followers. 

 This was realized when peopies of all religions, nationalities and dispositions became united in their beliefs and followed Christ in humility,  associating in love and brotherhood under the shadow of His divine protection. The Jews, being blind to this and holding to their bigoted imitations, were insolent and arrogant toward His Holiness and crucified Him. 

 Had they investigated the reality of Christ they would have beheld His beauty and truth. 

 God has given man the eye of investigation by which he may see and recognize truth. He has endowed man with ears that he may hear the message of reality and conferred upon him the gift of reason by which he may discover things for himself. 

 This is his endowment and equipment for the investigation of reality. Man is not intended to see through the eyes of another, hear through another's ears nor comprehend with another's brain. Each human creature has individual endowment, power and responsibility in the cr2ative plan of God. Therefore fore depend upon your own reason and judgment and adhere to the outcome of your own investigation; otherwise you will be utterly submerged in the sea of ignorance and deprived of all the bounties of God. Turn to God, supplicate humbly at His threshold, seeking assistance and confirmation,  that God may rend asunder the veils that obscure your vision. Then will your eyes be filled with illumination, face to face you will behold the reality of God and your heart become completely purified from the dross of ignorance, reflecting the glories and bounties of the Kingdom. 

 Holy souls are like soil which has been plowed and tilled with much earnest labor; the thorns and thistles cast aside and all weeds uprooted. 

 Such soil is most fruitful and the harvest from it will prove full and plenteous. 

 in this same way man must free himself from the weeds of ignorance, thorns of superstitions and thistles of imitations, that he may discover reality in the harvests of true knowledge. Otherwise the discovery of reality is impossible, contention and divergence  of religious belief will always remain and mankind, like ferocious wolves will rage and attack each other in-hatred  and antagonism. We supplicate God that He may destroy the veils which limit our vision and that these becloudings which darken the way of the manifestation of the shining lights may be dispelled in order that the effulgent Sun of Reality may shine forth. 

 We implore and invoke God, seeking His assistance and confirmation. Man is a child of God; most noble, lofty and beloved by God his creator. Therefore he must ever strive that the divine bounties and virtues bestowed upon him may prevail and control him. Just now the soil of human hearts seems like black earth, but in the innermost substance of this dark soil there are thousands of fragrant flowers latent. We must endeavor to cultivate and awaken these potentialities, discover the secret treasure in this very mine and depository  of God, bring fbrth these resplendent powers long hidden in human hearts. Then will the glories of both worlds be blended and increased and the quintessence of human existence be made manifest.


<p125>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS         125

  We must not be content with simply following a certain course because we find our fathers pursued that course. It is the duty of everyone to investigate reality, and investigation of reality by another will not do for us. If all in the world were rich and one man poor, of what use are these riches to that man? If all the world be virtuous  and a man steeped in vice, what good results are forthcoming from him? 

 If all the world be resplendent and a man blind, where are his benefits? If all the world be in plenty and a man hungry, what sustenance  does he derive? 

 Therefore every man must be an investigator for himself. Ideas and beliefs left by his fathers and ancestors as a heritage will not suffice, for adherence to these are but imitations and imitations have ever been a cause of disappointment and misguidance. 

 Be investigators of reality, that you may attain the verity of truth and life. 

 You have asked why it was necessary for the soui that was from God to make this journey back to God. Would you like to understand the reality of this question just as I teach it or do you wish to hear it as the world teaches it? — for if I should answer you according to the latter way, this would be but imitation and would not make the subject clear. 

 The reality underlying this question is that the evil spirit, Satan or whatever is interpreted as evil, refers to the lower nature in man. This baser nature is symbolized in various ways. In man there are two expressions, one is the expression of nature, the other the expression of the spiritual realm. The world of nature is defective. Look at it clearly, casting aside all superstition and imagination. 

 If you should leave a man uneducated and barbarous in the wilds of Africa, would there be any doubt about his remaining ignorant? 

 God has never created an evil spirit; all such ideas and nomenclature are symbols expressing the mere human or earthly nature of man. It is an essential condition of the soil of earth that thorns, weeds and fruitless trees may grow from it. Relatively speaking, this is evil; it is simply the lower state and baser product of nature. 

 It is evident therefore that man is in need of divine education and inspiration; that the spirit and bounties of God are essential to his development. That is to say, the teachings of Christ and the prophets are necessary for his education and guidance. Why? 

 Because they are the divine gardeners who till the earth of human hearts and minds. They educate man, uproot the weeds, burn the thorns and remodel the waste places into gardens and orchards where fruitful trees grow. 

 The wisdom and purpose of their training is that man must pass from degree to degree of progressive unfoldment until perfection is attained. For instance, if a man should live his entire life in one city, he cannot gain a knowledge of the whole world. To become perfectly informed he must visit other cities, see the mountains and valleys, cross the rivers and traverse the plains. In other words, without progressive and universal education, perfection will not be attained. 

 Man must walk in many paths and be subjected to various processes in his evoiu-tion  upward. 

 Physically he is not born in full stature but passes through consecutive stages of foetus, infant, childhood, youth, maturity and old age. Suppose he had the power to remain young throughout his life. He then would not understand the meaning of old age and could not believe it existed. If he could not realize the condition of old age he would not know that he was young. He would not know the difference between young and old without experiencing the old. Unless you have passed through the state of infancy how would you know this was an infant beside you? If there was no wrong how would you recognize the right? 

 If it were not for sin how would you appreciate virtue? 

 If evil deeds were unknown how could you commend good actions? If sickness did not exist how would you understand  health? 

 Evil is non — existent; it is the absence of good; sickness is the ioss of health; poverty the lack of riches. When wealth disappears you are poor; you look within the treasure box but find nothing there. 

 Without knowledge there is ignorance;  therefore ignorance is simply the lack of knowledge. Death is the absence of life.


<p126>
126             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Therefore on the one hand we have existence; on the other, nonexistence, negation or absence  of existence. 

 Briefly; the journey of the soui is necessary. 

 The pathway of life is the road which leads to divine knowledge and attainment. Without training and guidance the soui could never progress beyond the conditions of its lower nature which is ignorant and defective. 
                           
                 RELIGION:     ESSENTIAL AND NONESSENTIAL

  T HE world of existence is an emanation of the merciful attribute of God. God has shone forth upon the phenomena of being through His effulgence of mercy and He is clement and kind to all His creation. Therefore the world of humanity must ever be the recipient of bounties from the eternal Lord; even as His Holiness Christ has declared,  "Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in heaven." For His bounties like the light and heat of the sun in the material heavens descend alike upon all mankind. Consequently man must learn the lesson of kindness and beneficence from God Himself.  Just as God is kind to all humanity, man also must be kind to his fellow creatures.  If his attitude is just and loving toward his fellow men, toward all creation, then indeed is he worthy of being pronounced  the image and likeness of God. 

 Brotherhood or fraternity is of different kinds. 

 It may be family association, the intimate relationship of the household. This is limited and subject to change and disruption. 

 How often it happens that in a family love and agreement are changed into enmity and antagonism. 

 Another form of fraternity is manifest in patriotism. 

 Man loves his fellowmen because they belong to the same nativity. This is also limited and subject to change and disintegration, as for instance when sons of the same fatherland are opposed to each other in war, bloodshed and battle. Still another brotherhood  or fraternity is that which arises from racial unity, the oneness of racial origin, producing ties of affinity and association. This likewise has its limitation and liability to change, for often war and deadly strife have been witnessed between people and nations of the same racial lineage. 

 There is a fourth kind of brotherhood, the attitude of man toward humanity itself, the altruistic love of humankind and recognition of the fundamental human bond. Although this is unlimited it is nevertheless susceptible to change and destruction. 

 Even from this urn-versal fraternal bond the looked-for result does not appear. 

 What is the looked-for result?  Lovingkindness among all human creatures and a firm, indestructible brotherhood  which includes all the divine possibilities and significances in humanity. Therefore it is evident that fraternity, love and kindness  based upon family, nativity, race or an attitude of altruism are neither sufficient nor permanent since all of them are limited, restricted and liable to change and disruption.  For in the family there is discord and alienation; among sons of the same fatherland strife and internecine warfare are witnessed; between those of a given race, hostility and hatred are frequent; and even among the altruists varying aspects of opinion and lack of unselfish devotion give little promise of permanent and indestructible unity among mankind. 

 Therefore the Lord of mankind has caused His holy divine Manifestations to come into the world. 

 He has revealed His heavenly books in order to establish spiritual brotherhood, and through the power of the Holy Spirit has made it practicable for perfect fraternity to be realized among mankind. And when through the breaths of the Holy Spirit this perfect fraternity and agreement are enablished amongst men, this brotherhood and love being spiritual in character, this lovingkindness being heavenly, these constraining bonds being divine, a unity appears which is indissoluble, unchanging and never subject to transformation. 

 It is ever the same and will forever remain the same. 

 For example consider the foundation of the brotherhood laid by His 

Holiness Christ. Observe   
how that fraternity was


<p127>
EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'I SACRED WRITINGS         127

  conducive to unity and accord and how it brought various souls to a plane of uniform attainment where they were willing to sacrifice  their lives for each other. They were content to renounce possessions and ready to joyously forfeit life itself. They lived together in such love and fellowship that even Galen, the famous Greek philosopher, who was not a Christian, in his work entitled "The Progress of the Nations" says that religious beliefs are greatly conducive to the foundation of real civilization. As a proof thereof he says, ~tA certain number of people contemporaneous with us are known as Christians. 

 These enjoy the superlative degree of moral civilization. 

 Each one of them is a great philosopher because they live together in the utmost love and good-fel-lowship. 

 They sacrifice life for each other. They offer worldly possessions for each other. You can say of the Christian people that they are as one person. 

 There is a bond amongst them that is indissoluble in character." 

 It is evident therefore that the foundation of real brotherhood, the cause of loving cooperation and reciprocity and the source of real kindness and unselfish devotion is none other than the breaths of the Holy Spirit. Without this influence and animus it is impossible.  We may be able to realize some degrees of fraternity through other motives but these are limited associations and sub-lea  to change. 

 When human brotherhood is founded upon the Holy Spirit, it is eter-nil, changeless, unlimited. 

 In various parts of the Orient there was a time when brotherhood, lovingkindness and all the praiseworthy qualities of mankind seemed to have disappeared. 

 There was no evidence of patriotic, religious or racial fraternity but conditions of bigotry, hatred and prejudice prevailed instead. The adherents of each religion were violent enemies of the others, filled with the spirit of hostility  and eager for shedding of blood. The present war in the Balkans furnishes a parallel  of these conditions. 

 Consider the bloodshed, ferocity and oppression manifested there even in this enlightened century; all of it based fundamentally upon religious prejudice and disagreement. For the nations involved belong to the same races and na tivities, nevertheless they are savage and merciless toward each other. Similar deplorable  conditions prevailed in Persia in the nineteenth century. Darkness and ignorant  fanaticism were widespread; no trace of fellowship or brotherhood existed amongst the races. 

 On the contrary, human hearts were filled with rage and hatred; darkness and gloom were manifest in human lives and conditions everywhere. At such a time as this His Holiness Baha'u'llah appeared upon the divine horizon, even as the glory of the sun, and in that gross darkness and hopelessness of the human world there shone a great light. He founded the oneness of the world of humanity, declaring that all mankind are as sheep and that God is the real and true shepherd. 

 The shepherd is one and all people are of his flock. 

 The world of humanity is one and God is equally kind to all. What then is the source of unkindness and hatred in the human world? This real shepherd loves all his sheep. He leads them in green pastures. 

 He rears and protects them. What then is the source of enmity and alienation among humankind?  Whence this conflict and strife? The real underlying cause is lack of religious unity and association for in each of the great religions we find superstition, blind imitation of creeds, and theological formulae adhered to instead of the divine fundar mentals, causing difference and divergence among mankind instead of agreement and fellowship. Consequently strife, hatred and warfare have arisen, based upon this divergence  and separation. 

 If we investigate the foundations of the divine religions, we find them to be one, absolutely changeless and never subject to transformation. For example each of the divine religions contains two kinds of laws or ordinances. One division  concerns the world of morality and ethical institutions. These are the essential ordinances. 

 They instill and awaken the knowledge and love of God, love for humanity, the virtues of the world of mankind,  the attributes of the divine kingdom, rebirth and resurrection from the kingdom of nature. 

 These constitute one kind of divine law which is common to all and never sublect to change. From the dawn of the .4~ :'iic cycle to the present day this


<p128>
128             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  fundamental law of God has continued changeless. 

 This is the foundation of divine religion. 

 The second division comprises laws and institutions which provide for human needs and conditions according to exigencies of time and place. These are accidental, of no essential importance and should never have been made the cause and source of human contention. 

 For example during the time of His Holiness Moses — Upon Him be peace! 

 — according to the exigencies of that period divorce was permissible. During the cycle of His Holiness Christ inasmuch as divorce was not in conformity with the time and conditions 

His Holiness Jesus Christ 

 abrogated  it. In the cycle of Moses plurality of wives was permissible but during the time of His Holiness Christ the exigency which had sanctioned it did not exist, therefore it was forbidden. His Holiness Moses lived in the wilderness and desert of Sinai; therefore His ordinances and commandments were in conformity with those conditions. The penalty for theft was to cut off a man's hand. An ordinance of this kind was in keeping with desert life but not compatible with conditions of the present day. Such ordinances therefore constitute the second or nonessential division of the divine religions and are not of importance for they deal with human transactions which are ever changing according to the requirements of time and place. Therefore the intrinsic foundations of the divine religions are one. As this is true, why should hostility and strife exist among them? Why should this hatred and warfare, ferocity and bloodshed continue? 

 Is this allowable and lustified? God forbid! 
                          
                  RELIGION RENEWED

  CREATION is the expression of motion. Motion is life. 

 A moving object is a living oblect whereas that which is motionless and inert is as dead. 

 All created forms are progressive  in their planes or kingdoms of existence  under the stimulus of the power or spirit of life. The universal energy is dynamic.  Nothing is stationary in the material world of outer phenomena or in the inner world of intellect and consciousness. 

 Religion is the outer expression of the divine reality. Therefore it must be living, vitalized, moving and progressive. 

 If it be without motion and nonprogressive it is without the divine life; it is dead. The divine institutes are continuously active and evolutionary; therefore the revelation of them must be progressive and continuous. All things are subject to reformation. 

 This is a century of life and renewal. Sciences and arts, industry and invention have been reformed. Law and ethics have been reconstituted,  reorganized. 

 The world of thought has been regenerated. Sciences of former ages and philosophies of the past are useless today. Present exigencies demand new methods of solution; world problems are without precedent. Old ideas and modes of thought are fast becoming obsolete. Ancient laws and archaic ethical systems will not meet the requirements of modern conditions, for this is clearly the century of a new life, the century of the revelation of the reality and therefore the greatest of all centuries. 

 Consider how the scientific developments  of fifty years have surpassed and eclipsed the knowledge and achievements of all the former ages combined. 

 Would the announcements and theories of ancient astronomers explain our present knowledge of the sun-worlds and planetary systems? Would the mask of obscurity which beclouded mediaeval centuries meet the demand  for clear-eyed vision and understand-rng which characterizes the world today? In view of this, shall blind imitations of ancestral forms and theological interpretations continue to guide and control the religious life and spiritual development of humanity today? Shall man gifted with the power of reason unthinkingly follow and adhere to dogma, creeds and hereditary beliefs  which will not bear the analysis of reason in this century of effulgent reality? Unquestionably this will not satisfy men of science, for when they find premise or con

EXCERPTS FROM BAHA'! SACRED WRITINGS        129

  clusion contrary to present standards of proof and without real foundation, they reject that which has been formerly accepted as standard and correct and move forward from new foundations. 

 The divine prophets have revealed and founded religion. 

 They have laid down certain laws and heavenly principles for the guidance of mankind. 

 They have taught and promulgated the knowledge of God, established praiseworthy ethical ideals and inculcated the highest standards of virtue in the human world. Gradually these heavenly  teachings and foundations of reality have been beclouded by human interpretations  and dogmatic imitations of ancestral beliefs. 

 The essential realities which the prophets labored so hard to establish in human  hearts and minds while undergoing ordeals and suffering tortures of persecution, have now well nigh vanished. Some of these heavenly messengers have been killed, some imprisoned; all of them despised and rejected while proclaiming the reality of divinity. Soon after their departure from this world, the essential truth of their teachings was lost sight of and dogmatic imitations adhered to. Inasmuch as human interpretations and blind imitations differ widely, religious strife and disagreement have arisen among mankind, the light of true religion has been extinguished and the unity of the world of humanity destroyed. 

 The prophets of God voiced the spirit of unity and agreement. They have been the founders of divine real-fry.  Therefore if the nations of the world forsake imitations and investigate the reality underlying the revealed Word of God they will agree and become reconciled. For reality  is one and not multiple. 

 The nations and religions are steeped in blind and bigoted imitations. A than is a Jew because his father was a Jew. 

 The Mu-$ammadan  follows implicitly the footsteps of his ancestors in belief and observance. The Buddhist is true to his heredity as a Buddhist. That is to say they profess religious belief blindly and without investigation,  making unity and agreement impossible. 

 It is evident therefore that this condition will not be remedied without a reformation in the world of religion. In other words the fundamental reality of the divine religions must be renewed, reformed, revoiced to mankind. 

 From the seed of reality, religion has grown into a tree which has put forth leaves and branches, blossoms and fruit. After a time this tree has fallen into a condition of decay. 

 The leaves and blossoms have withered and perished; the tree has become stricken and fruitless. It is not reasonable that man should hold to the old tree, claiming  that its Life forces are undiminished, its fruit unequalled, its existence eternal. The seed of reality must be sown again in human hearts in order that a new tree may grow therefrom and new divine fruits refresh  the world. By this means the nations and peoples now divergent in religion will be brought into unity, imitations will be forsaken and a universal brotherhood in the reality itself will be established. 

 Warfare  and strife will cease among mankind; all will be reconciled as servants of God. For all are sheltered beneath the tree of His providence and mercy. God is kind to all; He is the giver of bounty to all alike, even as His Holiness Jesus Christ has declared that God ttsendeth rain on the just and on the unjust"; that is to say, the mercy of God is universal. All humanity is under the protection  of His love and favor, and unto all He has pointed the way of guidance and progress. 

 Progress is of two kinds, matetial and spiritual. 

 The former is attained through observation of the surrounding existence and constitutes the foundation of civilization.  Spiritual progress is through the breaths of the Holy Spirit and is the awakening of the conscious soui of man to perceive the reality of divinity. Material progress insures  the happiness of the human world. Spiritual progress insures the happiness and eternal continuance of the soui. The prophets of God have founded the laws of divine civilization. 

 They have been the root and fundamental source of all knowledge. They have established the principles of human brotherhood or fraternity which is of various kinds, such as the fraternity of farhily, of race, of nation and of ethical motives. These forms of fraternity, these bonds of brotherhood are merely temporal and transient in

  association. They do not insure harmony and are usually productive of disagreement. They do not prevent warfare and strife; on the contrary they are selfish, restricted and fruitful causes of enmity and hatred among mankind. 

 The spiritual brotherhood which is enkindled and established through the breaths of the Holy Spirit unites nations and removes the cause of warfare and strife. It transforms mankind into one great family  and establishes the foundations of the oneness of humanity. It promulgates the spirit of international agreement and insures universal peace. Therefore we must investigate  the foundation reality of this heavenly fraternity. 

 'We must forsake all imitations and promote the reality of the divine teachings.  In accordance with these principles and actions by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, both material and spiritual happiness shall become realized. Until all nations and peoples become united by the bonds of the Holy Spirit in this real fraternity, until national and international prejudices are effaced in the reality of this spiritual brotherhood, true progress, prosperity and lasting happiness will not be attained by man. This is the century of new and universal nationhood.  Sciences have advanced, industries have progressed, politics have been reformed, liberty has been proclaimed, justice is awakening. 

 This is the century of motion, divine stimulus and accomplishment; the century of human solidarity and altruistic service; the century of universal peace and the reality of the divine Kingdom.

               THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
                FIRST BAHA'I CENTURY

           B~ ARCHDEACON GEORGE TOWNSHEND

  ON THE 23rd of May of this auspicious year, 1944, the Baha'i world will celebrate the centennial anniversary of the founding of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 It will commemorate  at once the hundredth anniversary of the inception of the BAJA Dispensation, of the inauguration of the Baha'i Era, of the commencement of the Baha'i Cycle, and of the birth of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 The weight of the potentialities with which this Faith, possessing no peer or equal in the world's spiritual history, and marking the culmination of a universal prophetic cycle, has been endowed, staggers our imagination. 

 The brightness of the millennial glory which it must shed in the fullness of time dazzles our eyes. 

 The magnitude of the shadow which its Author will continue to cast on successive Prophets destined to be raised up after Him eludes our calculation. 

 Already in the space of less than a century the operation of the mysterious processes generated by its creative spirit has provoked a tumult in human society such as no mind can fathom. Itself undergoing a period of incubation during its primitive age, it has, through the emergence of its slowly-crystallizing system, induced a fermentation in the general life of mankind designed to shake the very foundations of a disordered society, to purify its lifeblood, to reorientate  and reconstruct its institutions, and shape its final destiny. 

 To what else can the observant eye or the unprejudiced mind, acquainted with the signs and portents heralding the birth, and accompanying the rise, of the Faith of Baha'u'llah  ascribe this dire, this planetary upheaval,  with its attendant destruction, misery and fear, if not to the emergence of His embryonic World Order, which, as He Himself has unequivocally proclaimed, has cede ranged the equilibri in of the world and revolutionized inanizind's ordered life"? 

 To what agency, if not to the irresistible diffusion of that world-shaking, world-energiz-ing,  world-redeeming spirit, which the B~b has affirmed is rrvibratiisg in the innermost realities of all created things" can the origins of this portentous crisis, incomprehensible to man, and admittedly unprecedented in the annals of the human race, be attributed? In the convulsions of contemporary society, in the frenzied, worldwide ebullitions of men's thoughts, in the fierce antagonisms inflaming  races, creeds and classes, in the shipwreck of nations, in the downfall of kings, in the dismemberment of empires, in the extinction of dynasties, in the collapse of ecclesiastical heirarchies, in the deterioration of time-honored institutions, in the dissolution  of ties, secular as well as religious, that had for so long held together the members of the human race — all manifesting themselves with ever-increasing gravity since the outbreak of the first World 'War that immediately  preceded the opening years of the Formative Age of the Faith of Baha'u'llah —  in these we can readily recognize the evidences of the travail of an age that has sus 131

  tamed the impact of His Revelation, that has ignored His summons, and is now laboring  to be delivered of its burden, as a direct consequence of the impulse communicated to it by the generative, the purifying, the transmuting influence of His Spirit. 

 It is my purpose, on the occasion of an anniversary of such profound significance, to attempt in the succeeding pages a survey of the outstanding events of the century that has seen this Spirit burst forth upon the world, as well as the initial stages of its subsequent incarnation in a System that must evolve into an Order designed to embrace  the whole of mankind, and capable of fulfilling the high destiny that awaits man on this planet. 

 I shall endeavor to review, in their proper perspective and despite the comparatively brief space of time which separates  us from them, the events which the revolution of a hundred years, unique alike in glory and tribulation, has unrolled before our eyes. I shall seek to represent and correlate, in however cursory a manner, those momentous happenings which have insensibly,  relentlessly, and under the very eyes of successive generations, perverse, indifferent or hostile, transformed a heterodox and seemingly negligible offshoot of the Shaykhi school of the Ithn4-'Ashariyyih sect of Shi'ah IslAm into a world religion whose unnumbered followers are organically and indissolubly united; whose light has overspread the earth as far as Iceland in the North and Magellanes in the South; whose ramifications have spread to no less than sixty countries of the world; whose literature has been translated and disseminated in no less than forty languages; whose endowments  in the five continents of the globe, whether local, national or international,  already run into several million dollars;  whose incorporated elective bodies have secured the official recognition of a number of governments in East and West; whose adherents are recruited from the diversified races and chief religions of mankind; whose representatives are to be found in hundreds of cities in both Persia and the United States of America; to whose verities royalty has publicly and repeatedly testified; whose independent  status its enemies, from the ranks of its parent religion and in the leading center of both the Arab and Muslim worlds, have proclaimed and demonstrated; and whose claims have been virtually recognized, entitling it to rank as the fourth religion of a Land in which its world spiritual center has been established, and which is at once the heart of Christendom, the holiest shrine of the Jewish people, and, save Mecca alone, the most sacred spot in IslAm. 

 It is not my purpose — nor does the occasion  demand it, — to write a detailed history  of the last hundred years of the Baha Faith, nor do I intend to trace the origins of so tremendous a Movement, or to portray the conditions under which it was born, or to examine the character of the religion from which it has sprung, or to arrive at an estimate of the effects which its impact upon the fortunes of mankind has produced. 

 I shall rather content myself with a review of the salient features of its birth and rise, as well as of the initial stages in the establishment of its administrative institutions  — institutions which must be regarded as the nucleus and herald of that World Order that must incarnate the scm1, execute the laws, and fulfill the purpose of the Faith of God in this day. 

 Nor will it be my intention to ignore, whilst surveying the panorama which the revolution of a hundred years spreads before our gaze, the swift interweaving of seeming reverses with evident victories, out of which the hand of an inscrutable Providence has chosen to form the pattern of the Faith from its earliest days, or to minimize those disasters that have so often proved themselves to be the prelude to fresh triumphs which have, in turn, stimulated its growth and consolidated its past achievements. 

 Indeed, the history of the first hundred years of its evolution resolves itself into a series of internal  and external crises, of varying severity, devastating in their immediate effects, but each mysteriously releasing a corresponding  measure of divine power, lending thereby a fresh impulse to its unfoldment, this further  unfoldment engendering in its turn a still graver calamity, followed by a still more liberal effusion of celestial grace enabling its upholders to accelerate still further  its march and win in its service still more compelling victories.


<p133>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 '33

  In its broadest outline the first century of the Baha'i Era may be said to comprise the Heroic, the Primitive, the Apostolic Age of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and also the initial stages of the Formative, the 

Transitional,  the Iron   

 Age which is to witness the crystallization and shaping of the creative energies released by His Revelation. 

 The first eighty years of this century may roughly be said to have covered the entire period of the first age, while the last two decades may be regarded as having witnessed the beginnings  of the second. The former commences with the Declaration of the B&b, includes the mission of Baha'u'llah, and terminates  with the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The latter is ushered in by His Will and Testament, which defines its character and establishes its foundation. 

 The century under our review may therefore be considered as falling into four distinct  periods, of unequal duration, each of specific import and of tremendous and indeed  unappraisable significance. These four periods are closely interrelated, and constitute  successive acts of one, indivisible, stupendous and sublime drama, whose mystery  no intellect can fathom, whose climax no eye can even dimly perceive, whose conclusion  no mind can adequately foreshadow. Each of these acts revolves around its own theme, boasts of its own heroes, registers its own tragedies, records its own triumphs, and contributes its own share to the execution of one common, immutable Purpose. To isolate any one of them from the others, to dissociate the later manifestations of one universal,  all-embracing Revelation from the pristine purpose that animated it in its earliest days, would be tantamount to a mutilation of the structure an which it rests, and to a lamentable perversion of its truth and of its history. 

 The first period (18441853), centers around the gentle, the youthful and irresistible person of the B~b, matchless in His meekness, imperturbable in His serenity, magnetic in His utterance, unrivaled in the dramatic episodes of His swift and tragic ministry. 

 It begins with the Declaration of His Mission, culminates in His martyrdom, and ends in a veritable orgy of religious massacre revolting in its hideousness. 

 It is characterized by nine years of fierce and relentless contest, whose theatre was the whole of Persia, in which above ten thousand heroes laid down their lives, in which two sovereigns of the Q6j6.r dynasty and their wicked ministers participated, and which was supported by the entire Shi'ah ecclesiastical hierarchy, by the military resources of the state, and by the implacable hostility of the masses. 

 The second period (18531892) derives its inspiration from the august figure Baha'u'llah, preeminent in holiness, awesome in the majesty of His strength and power, unapproachable in the. transcendent brightness of His glory. It opens with the first stirrings, in the soui of Baha'u'llah while in the Siy~h-ChM of TihrTh, of the Revelation anticipated by the Bib, attains its plenitude in the proclamation of that Revelation to the kings and ecclesiastical leaders of the earth, and terminates in the ascension of its Author in the vicinity of the prison-town of 'AkM. It extends over thirty-nine years of continuous, of unprecedented  and overpowering Revelation, is marked by the propagation of the Faith to the neighboring territories of Turkey, of Russia, of 'Ir&q, of Syria, of Egypt and of India, and is distinguished by a corresponding  aggravation of hostility, represented by the united attacks launched by the shAh of Persia and the Sul~n of Turkey, the two admittedly most powerful potentates of the East, as well as by the opposition of the twin sacerdotal orders of Shi'ah and Sunni IsUm. 

 The third period (18921921) revolves  around the vibrant personality of 'Abdu'l-Baha, mysterious in His essence, unique in• His station, astoundingly potent in both the charm and strength of His character. 

 It commences with the announcement  of the Covenant of Baha'u'llah, a document without parallel in the history of any earlier Dispensation, attains its climax in the emphatic assertion by the Center of that Covenant, in the City of the Covenant, of the unique character and far-reaching implications of that Document, and closes with His passing and the interment of His remains  on Mt. Garmel. 

 It will go down in history as a period of almost thirty years' duration, in which tragedies and triumphs have been so intertwined as to eclipse at


<p134>
134             THE BAnAl WORLD

  one time the Orb of the Covenant, and at another time to pour forth its light over the continent of Europe, and as far as Australasia, the Far East and the North American continent. The fourth period (19211944) is motivated by the forces radiating from the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, that 

Charter of Baha'u'llah's New

 World Order, the offspring resulting from the mystic intercourse between Him Who is the Source of the Law of God and the mind of the One Who is the vehicle and interpreter of that Law. The inception of this fourth, this last period of the first Baha'i century synchronizes with the birth of the Formative Age of the Baha'i Era, with the founding of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah — a sys-tern  which is at once the harbinger, the nucleus and pattern of His World Order. This period, covering the first twenty-three years of this Formative Age, has already been distinguished by an outburst of further hostility, of a different character, accelerating on the one hand the diffusion of the Faith over a still wider area in each of the five continents of the globe, and resulting on the other in the emancipation and the recognition of the independent status of several communities within its pale. 

 These four periods are to be regarded not oniy as the component, the inseparable parts of one stupendous whole, but as progressive stages in a single evolutionary process, vast, steady and irresistible. For as we survey the entire range which the operation of a cen-tury-old  Faith has unfolded before us, we cannot escape the conclusion that from whatever angle we view this colossal scene, the events associated with these periods present to us unmistakable evidences of a slowly maturing process, of an orderly development, of internal consolidation, of external expansion, of a gradual emancipation from the fetters of religious orthodoxy, and of a corresponding diminution of civil disabilities and restrictions. 

 Viewing these periods of Baha'i history as the constituents of a single entity, we note the chain of events proclaiming successfully the rise of a Forerunner, the Mission of One Whose advent that Forerunner had promised, the establishment of a Covenant generated through the direct authority of the Promised One Himself, and lastly the birth of a System  which is the child sprung from both the Author of the Covenant and its appointed Center. 

 We observe how the Bib, the Forerunner,  announced the impending inception of a divinely-conceived Order, how Bafr4' —  u'llAh, the Promised One, formulated its laws and ordinances, how 'Abdu'l-Baha, the appointed Center, delineated its features, and how the present generation of their followers have commenced to erect the framework of its institutions. 'We watch, through these periods, the, infant light of the Faith diffuse itself from its cradle, eastward to India and the Far East, westward to the neighboring territories of 'Jriq, of Turkey, of Russia, and of Egypt, travel as far as the North Ama-wan  continent, illuminate subsequently the ifiajor countries of Europe, envelop with its radiance, at a later stage, the Antipodes, brighten the fringes of the Arctic, and finally set aglow the Central and South 

American horizons. We      

 witness a corresponding increase  in the diversity of the elements within its fellowship, which from being confined, in the first period of its history, to an obscure body of followers chiefly recruited from the ranks of the masses in Shi'ah Persia, has expanded into a fraternity representative of the leading religious systems of the world, of almost every caste and color, from the humblest worker and peasant to royalty itself. 

 We notice a similar development in the extent of its literature — a literature which, restricted at first to the narrow range of hurriedly transcribed, often corrupted, secretly circulated, manuscripts, so furtively perused, so frequently effaced, and at times even eaten by the terrorized members of a proscribed sect, has, within the space of a century, swelled into innumerable editions, comprising tens of thousands of printed volumes, in diverse scripts, and in no less than forty languages, some elaborately reproduced, others profusely illustrated, all methodically and vigorously disseminated through the agency of worldwide, properly constituted and specially organized committees and Assemblies. We perceive a no


<p135>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH            135

  iess apparent evolution in the scope of its teachings, at first designedly rigid, complex and severe, subsequently recast, expanded, and liberalized under the succeeding Dispensation, later expounded, reaffirmed and amplified by an appointed Interpreter, and lastly systematized and universally applied to both individuals and institutions. We can discover a no less distinct gradation in the character of the opposition it has had to encounter — an opposition, at first kindled in the bosom of Shi'ah IslAm, which, at a later stage, gathered momentum with the banishment of Baha'u'llah to the domains of the Turkish Sulvin and the consequent hostility of the more powerful Sunni hierarchy  and its Caliph, the head of the vast majority of the followers of Mu1~ammad —  an opposition which, now, through the rise of a divinely appointed Order in the Christian  'West, and its initial impact on civil and ecclesiastical institutions, bids fair to include among its supporters established governments and systems associated with the most ancient, the most deeply entrenched sacerdotal hierarchies  in Christendom. 

 We can, at the same time, recognize, through the haze of an ever-widening hostility, the progress, painful yet persistent, of certain communities within its pale through the stages of obscurity, of proscription, of emancipation, and of recognition  — stages that must needs culminate in the course of succeeding centuries, in the establishment of the Faith, and the founding, in the plenitude of its power and authority, of the world-embracing 

Baha'i Commonwealth.  We  

 can likewise discern a no 'ess appreciable advance in the rise of its institutions, whether as administrative centers or places of worship — institutions, clandestine and subterrane in their earliest beginnings. emerging imperceptibly into the broad daylight  of public recognition, legally protected, enriched by pious endowments, ennobled at first by the erection of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of ~Ishq&Md, the first Baha'i House of Worship, and more recently immortalized, through the rise in the heart of the North American continent of the Mother Temple of the West, the forerunner of a divine, a slowly maturing civilization. And finally, we can even bear witness to the marked improvement in the conditions surrounding the pilgrimages performed by its devoted adherents to its consecrated shrines at its world center — pilgrimages originally arduous, perilous, tediously long, often made on foot, at times ending in disappointment, and confined  to a handful of harassed Oriental fol-. lowers, gradually attracting, under steadily improving circumstances of security and comfort, an ever swelling number of new converts converging from the four corners of the globe, and culminating in the widely publicized yet sadly frustrated visit of a noble Queen, who, at the very threshold of the city of her heart's desire, was compelled, according to her own written testimony, to divert her steps, and forego the privilege of so priceless a benefit. 
                           
                  B~ SHOGHI EFFENDI

  THUS drew to a ciose the first century of the Baha'i era — an epoch which, in its sublimity and fecundity, is without parallel in the entire field of religious history, and indeed in the annals of mankind. 

 A process, God-impelled, endowed with measureless potentialities, mysterious in its workings, awful in the retribution meted out to every one seeking to resist its operation, infinitely rich in its promise for the regeneration and redemption of human kind, had been set in motion in ShirAz had gained momentum successively in Tihr~n, BaghdAd, Adrianople and 'Akka, had projected itself across the seas, poured its generative influences into the West, and manifested the initial evidences of its marvelous, world-energizing force in the midst of the North American continent. 

 It had sprung from the heart of Asia, and pressing westward had gathered speed in its resistless course, until it had encircled the earth with a girdle of glory. It had been


<p136>
136             THE  BAHA'I  WORLD

  generated by the son of a mercer in the province of Firs, had been reshaped by a nobleman of Niir, had been reinforced through the exertions of One Who had spent the fairest years of His youth and manhood m exile and imprisonment, and had achieved its most conspicuous triumphs in a country and amidst a people living half the circuin-ference  of the globe distant from the land of its origin. 

 It had repulsed every onslaught directed against it, torn down every barrier opposing its advance, abased every proud antagonist who had sought to sap its strength, and had exalted to heights of incredible  courage the weakest and humblest among those who had arisen and become willing instruments of its revolutionizing power. 

 Heroic struggles and matchless victories, interwoven with appalling tragedies and condign punishments, have formed the pattern of its hundred year old history. 

 A handful of students, belonging to the Shaykhi school, sprung from the Ithn4-'Ashariyyih  sect of Shi'ah IslAm, had, in consequence of the operation of this process, been expanded and transformed into a world community, closely knit, clear of vision, alive, consecrated by the sacrifice of no less than twenty thousand martyrs; supranational; nonsectarian; nonpolitical; claiming the status, and assuming the functions, of a world religion; spread over five continents and the islands of the seas; with ramifications  extending over sixty sovereign states and seventeen dependencies; equipped with a literature translated and broadcast in forty languages; exercising control over endowments representing several million dollars; recognized by a number of governments in both the East and the West; integral in aim and outlook; possessing no professional clergy; professing a single belief; following a single law; animated by a single purpose; organically united through an Administrative Order, divinely ordained and unique in its features; including within its orbit representatives of all the leading religions of the world, of various classes and races; faithful to its civil obligations; conscious of its civic responsibilities, as well as of the perils confronting  the society of which it forms a part; sharing the sufferings of that society and confident of its own high destiny. 

 The nucleus of this community had been formed by the BTh, soon after the night of the Declaration of 

His Mission to Mulli      

 ~Iusayn in Shiriz. A clamor in which the Sh6h, his government, his people and the entire ecclesiastical hierarchy of his country unanimously joined had greeted its birth. Captivity, swift and cruel, in the mountains of Adhirbiyjdn, had been the lot of its youthful Founder, almost immediately after His return from His pilgrimage to Mecca. Amidst the solitude of MTh-Kii and Chihriq, He had instituted 

His Covenant, formulated His

 laws, and transmitted to posterity the overwhelming majority of His writings. 

 A conference of His disciples, headed by Baha'u'llah, had, in the hamlet of Badasht, abrogated  in dramatic circumstances the laws of the Islamic, and ushered in the new, 

Dispensation.  In Tabriz 

 He had, in the presence of the Heir to the Throne and the leading ecclesiastical dignitaries of .Adhirb4yj An, publicly and unreservedly voiced His claim to be none other than the promised, the long-awaited  QA'im. 

 Tempests of devastating violence in M6zindarin, Nayriz, Zanj in and Tihr~n had decimated the ranks of His followers  and robbed Him of the noblest and most valuable of His supporters. 

 He Himself had to witness the virtual annihilation of His Faith and the loss of most of the Letters of the Living, and after experiencing, in His own person, a series of bitter humiliations, He had been executed by a firing squad in the barrack-square of Tabriz. A blood bath of unusual ferocity had engulfed the greatest heroine of His Faith, had further denuded it of its adherents, had extinguished the life of His trusted amanuensis and repository of His last wishes, and swept Baha'u'llah into the depths of the foulest dungeon of TihrAn. 

 In the pestilential atmosphere of the Siy~h-ChM, nine years after that historic Declaration, the Message proclaimed by the B~b had yielded its fruit, His promise had been redeemed, and the most glorious, the most momentous period of the Heroic Age of the Baha'i era had dawned. A momentary eclipse of the newly risen Sun of Truth, the world's greatest Luminary, had ensued, as a

  result of Baha'u'llah's precipitate banishment to 'Ir4q by order of N~i~iri'd-Din ShAh, of His sudden withdrawal to the mountains of Kurdist4n, and of the degradation and confusion that afflicted the remnant of the persecuted community of His fellow-dis-ciples in Baghdad. A reversal in the fortunes of a fast declining community, following His return from His two-year retirement; had set in, bringing in its wake the recreation  of that community, the reformation of its morals, the enhancement of its prestige, the enrichment of its doctrine, and culminating  in the Declaration of His Mission in the garden of Naj ibiyyih to His immediate companions on the eve of His banishment to Constantinople. Another crisis — the severest a struggling Faith was destined to experience in the course of its history — precipitated by the rebellion of the BTh's nominee and the iniquities perpetrated by him and by the evil genius that had seduced him, had, in Adrianople, well nigh disrupted the newly consolidated forces of the Faith and all but destroyed in a baptism of fire the community of the Most Great Name which Baha'u'llah had called into being. Cleansed of the pollution  of this CCMOSt Great Idol," undeterred by the convulsion that had seized it, an indestructible Faith had, in the strength of the Covenant instituted by the Bab, now surmounted the most formidable obstacles it was ever to meet; and in this very hour it reached its meridian glory through the proc-larnation  of the Mission of Baha'u'llah to the kings, the rulers and ecclesiastical leaders of the world in both the East and the 'West. Close on the heels of this unprecedented victory had followed the climax of His sufferings,  a banishment to the penal colony of 'Akka, decreed by Sul~n 'Abdu'1-'Aziz. This had been hailed by vigilant enemies as the signal for the final extermination of a much feared and hated adversary, and it had heaped upon that Faith in this fortress-town, designated by Baha'u'llah as His CCMOSt Great Prison," calamities from both within and without, such as it had never before experienced.  The formulation of the laws and ordinances of a newborn Dispensation and the enunciation and reaffirmation of its fundamental damental principles — the warp and woof of a future Administrative Order — had, however,  enabled a slowly maturing Revelation, in spite of this tide of tribulations, to adVance a stage further and yield its fairest fruit. 

 The ascension of Baha'u'llah had plunged into grief and bewilderment His loyal supporters,  quickened the hopes of the betrayers of His Cause, who had rebelled against His God-given authority, and rejoiced and encouraged  His political as well as ecclesiastical adversaries. 

 The Instrument He had forged, the Covenant He had Himself instituted, had canalized, after His passing, the forces released by Him in the course of a forty-year  ministry, had preserved the unity of His Faith and provided the impulse required to propel it forward to achieve its destiny. The proclamation of this new Covenant had been followed by yet another crisis, precipitated by one of His own sons on whom, according to the provisions of that Instrument,  had been conferred a rank second to none except the Center of that Covenant Himself. 

 Impelled by the forces engendered by the revelation of that immortal and unique Document, an nnbreachable Faith (having registered its initial victory over the Covenant-breakers), had, under the leadership of 'Abdu'l-Baha, irradiated the West, illuminated the Western fringes of Europe, hoisted its banner in the heart of the North American continent, and set in motion the processes that were to culminate in the transfer of the mortal remains of its Herald to the Holy Land and their entombment in a mausoleum on Mt. Carmel, as well as in the erection of its first House of Worship in Russian Turkist~n. 

 A major crisis, following swiftly upon the signal victories achieved in East and West, attributable to the monstrous  intrigues of the Arch-breaker of Baha'u'llah's Covenant and to the orders issued by the tyrannical 'Abdu'1-Hamid, had exposed, during more than seven years, the Heart and Center of the Faith to imminent peril, filled with anxiety and anguish its followers  and postponed the execution of the enterprises conceived for its spread and consolidation.  'Abdu'l-Baha's historic journeys in Europe and America, soon after the fall

  of that tyrant and the collapse of his r6gime, had dealt a staggering blow to the Covenant-breakers, had consolidated the colossal enterprise  He had undertaken in the opening years of His ministry, had raised the prestige of His Father's Faith to heights it had never before attained, had been instrumental in proclaiming its verities far and wide, and had paved the way for the diffusion of its light over the Far East and as f at as the Antipodes. 

 Another major crisis — the last the Faith was to undergo at its world center — provoked by the cruel JamM P~shi and accentuated by the anxieties of a devastating world war, by the privations it entailed and the rupture of communications it brought about, had threatened with still graver peril the Head of the Faith Himself, as well as the holiest sanctuaries enshrining the remains of its twin Founders. The revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, during the somber  days of that tragic conflict, had, in the concluding years of 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, invested the membets of the leading Baha'i community in the West — the champions of a future Administrative Order — with a world mission which, in the concluding years of the first Baha'i century, was to shed deathless glory upon the Faith and its administrative  institutions. 

 The conclusion of that long and distressing conflict had frustrated  the hopes of that military despot and inflicted an ignominious defeat on him, had removed, once and for all, the danger that had overshadowed for sixty-five years the Founder of the Faith and the Center of His Covenant, fulfilled the prophecies recorded by Him in His writings, enhanced still further the prestige of His Faith and its Leader, and been signalized by the spread of His Message to the continent of Australia. 

 The sudden passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, marking the close of the Primitive Age of the Faith, had, as had been the case with the ascension of His Father, submerged in sorrow and consternation His faithful disciples, imparted  fresh hopes to the dwindling followers of both Mirza Ya1~y~ and Mirza Mu]iam-mad-'Ali, and stirred to feverish activity political as well as ecclesiastical adversaries, all of whom anticipated the impending dismemberment of the communities which the Center of the Covenant had so greatly inspired and ably led. The promulgation of His Will and Testament, inaugurating the Formative Age of the Baha'i era, the Charter delineating the features of an Order which the Bab had announced, which Baha'u'llah had envisioned, and whose laws and principles He had enunciated, had galvanized these communities in Europe, Asia, Africa and America into concerted action, enabling them to erect and consolidate the framework of this Order, by establishing its local and national Assemblies, by framing the constitutions of these Assemblies, by securing the recognition on the part of the civil authorities  in various countries of these institutions, by founding administrative headquarters,  by raising the superstructure of the first House of Worship in the West, by establishing and extending the scope of the endowments of the Faith and by obtaining the full recognition by the civil authorities of the religious character of these endowments  at its world center as well as in the North American continent. 

 A severe, a historic censure pronounced by a Muslim ecclesiastical court in Egypt bad, whilst this mighty process — the laying of the structural basis of the Baha'i world Administrative Order — was being initiated, officially expelled all adherents of the Faith of Muslim extraction from Ishm, had condemned  them as heretics and brought the members of a proscribed community face to face with tests and perils of a character they had never known before. 

 The unjust decision  of a civil court in Baghdid, instigated by Shi'ah enemies, in 'IrAq, and the decree issued by a still more redoubtable adversary in Russia had, moreover, robbed the Faith, on the one hand, of one of its holiest centers of pilgrimage, and denied it, on the other, the use of its first House of Worship, initiated  by 'Abdu'l-Baha and erected in the course of His ministry. 

 And finally, inspired by this unexpected declaration made by an agelong enemy — marking the first step in the march of their Faith towards total emancipation — and undaunted by this double blow struck at its institutions, the followers of Baha'u'llah, already united and fully equipped through the agencies of a


<p139>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 139

  firmly established Administrative Order, had arisen to crown the immortal records of the first Baha century by vindicating the independent character of their Faith, by enforcing  the fundamental laws ordained in their Most Holy Book, by demanding and in some cases obtaining, the recognition by the ruling authorities of their right to be classi-fled as followers of an independent religion, by securing from the world's highest Tribunal  its condemnation of the injustice they had suffered at the hands of their persecutors, by establishing their residence in no less than thirty-four additional countries, as well as in thirteen dependencies, by disseminating their literature in twenty-nine additional languages, by enrolling a Queen in the ranks of the supporters of their Cause, and lastly by launching an enterprise which, as that century approached its end, enabled them to complete the exterior ornamentation of their second House of Worship, and to bring to a successful conclusion the first stage of the Plan which 'Abdu'l-Baha had conceived for the worldwide and systematic propagation of their Faith. 

 Kings, emperors, princes, whether of the East or of the West, had, as we look back upon the tumultuous record of an entire century, either ignored the summons of its Founders, or derided their Message, or decreed their exile and banishment, or barbarously  persecuted their followers, or sedulously striven to discredit their teachings. They were visited by the wrath of the Almighty, many losing their thrones, some witnessing the extinction of their dynasties, a few being assassinated or covered with shame, others finding themselves powerless to avert the cataclysmic dissolution of their kingdoms, still others being degraded to positions  of subservience in their own realms. 

 The Caliphate, its archenemy, bad unsheathed the sword against its Author and thrice pronounced  His banishment. It was humbled to dust, and, in its ignominious collapse, suffered  the same fate as the Jewish hierarchy, the chief persecutor of Jesus Christ, had suffered at the hands of its Roman masters, in the first century of the Christian Era, almost two thousand years before. Members of various sacerdotal orders, hi'ah, Sunni, Zoroastrian and Christian, had fiercely assailed the Faith, branded as heretic its supporters, and labored unremittingly to disrupt  its fabric and subvert its fofindations. The most redoubtable and hostile amongst these orders were either overthrown or virtually  dismembered, others rapidly declined in prestige and influence, all w~re made to sustain the impact of a secular power, aggres —  sive and determined to curtail their privileges and assert its own authority. Apostates, rebels, betrayers, heretics, had exerted their utmost endeavors, privily or openly, to sap the loyalty of the followers of that Faith, to split their ranks or assault their institutions. These enemies were, one by one, some gradually,  others with dramatic swiftness, confounded, dispersed, swept away and forgotten.  Not a few among its leading figures, its earliest disciples, its foremost champions, the companions and fellow-exiles of its Founders, trusted amanuenses and secretaries of its Author and of the Center of His Covenant, even some of those who were numbered among the kindred of the Manifestation Himself, not excluding the nominee of the BTh and the son of Baha'u'llah, named by Him in the Book of His Covenant, had allowed themselves to pass out from under its shadow, to bring shame upon it, through acts of indelible infamy, and to provoke crises of such dimensions as have never been experienced be any previous religion. 

 All were precipitated, without exception, from the enviable positions they occupied, many of them lived to behold the frustration of their designs, others were plunged into degradation and misery, utterly impotent to impair the unity, or stay the march, of the Faith they had so shamelessly forsaken. Ministers, ambassadors and other state dignitaries had plotted assiduously to pervert its purpose, had instigated the successive banishments of its Founders, and maliciously striven to undermine  its foundations. 

 They had, through such plottings, unwittingly brought about their own downfall, forfeited the confidence of their sovereigns, drunk the cup of disgrace to its dregs, and irrevocably sealed their own doom. 

 Humanity itself, perverse and utterly heedless, had refused to lend a hearing ear to the insistent appeals and warnings sounded


<p140>
140             THE BAHA'! WORLD

  by the twin Founders of the Faith, and later voiced by the Center of the Covenant in His public discourses in the West. It had plunged into two desolating wars of unprecedented magnitude, which have deranged its equilibrium,  mown down its youth, and shaken it to its roots. The weak, the obscure, the downtrodden had, on the other hand, through their allegiance to so mighty a Cause and their response to its summons, been enabled  to accomplish such feats of valor and heroism as to equal, and in some cases to dwarf, the exploits of those men and women of undying fame whose names and deeds adorn the spiritual annals of mankind. 

 Despite the blows leveled at its nascent strength, whether by the wielders of temporal and spiritual authority from without, or by black7hearted foes from within, the Faith of Baha'u'llah had, far from breaking or bending, gone from strength to strength, from victory to victory. Indeed its history, if read aright, may be said to resolve itself into a series of pulsations, of alternating crises and triumphs, leading it ever nearer to its divinely appointed destiny. The outburst of savage fanaticism that greeted the birth of the Revelation proclaimed by the BTh, His subsequent arrest and captivity, had been followed by the formulation of the laws of His Dispensation, by the institution of His Covenant, by the inauguration of that Dispensation  in Badasht and by the public assertion of His station in Tabriz. 

 Widespread  and still more violent uprisings in the provinces, His own execution, the blood bath which followed it and ]lahA'u'llAh's imprisonment  in the SiyTh-ChAI had been succeeded  by the breaking of the dawn of the Baha'i Revelation in that dungeon. Baha'u'llah's banishment to 'IrAq, His withdrawal to KurdistAn and the confusion and distress that afflicted His fellow-disciples in Bagh-d~id  had, in turn, been followed by the resurgence of the B&bi community, culminating  in the Declaration of His Mission in the Najibiyyih Garden. SultAn 'Abdu'I-'Aziz's decree summoning Him to Constantinople and the crisis precipitated by Mirza Yahy~ had been succeeded by the proclamation of that Mission to the crowned heads of the world and its ecclesiastical leaders. Baha'u'llah's banishment to the penal coiony of 'Akka, with all its attendant troubles and miseries, had, in its turn, led to the promulgation of the laws and ordinances of His Revelation and to the institution of His Covenant, the last act of His life. 

 The fiery tests engendered by the rebellion of Mirza Muhammad-'Ali and his associates had been succeeded by the introduction of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the West and the transfer of the Bib's remains to the Holy Land. The renewal of 'Abdu'l-Baha's incarceration and the perils and anxieties consequent upon it had resulted in the downfall of 'Abdu'1-Hamid,  in 'Abdu'l-Baha's release from His confinement, in the entombment of the BTh's remains on Mt. Carrn$, and in the triumphal journeys undertaken by the Center of the Covenant Himself in Europe and America. The outbreak of a devastating world war and the deepening of the dangers to which Jam&1 ThsM and the Covenant-breakers had exposed Him had led to the revelation of th~ Tablets of the Divine Plan, to the flight of that overbearing Commander, to the liberation of the Holy Land, to the enhancement of the prestige of the Faith at its world center, and to a marked expansion of its activities in East and West. 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing and the agitation which His removal had provoked had been followed by the promulgation of His Will and Testament, by the inauguration of the Formative Age of the Baha'i era and by the laying of the foundations of a world-embracing Administrative Order. And finally, the seizure of the keys of the Tomb of Baha'u'llah by the Covenant-breakers, the forcible occupation of His House in BaghdAd by the Slii'ah community, the outbreak of persecution in Russia and the expulsion of the Baha'i community from Jsl&m in Egypt had been succeeded  by the public assertion of the independent  religious status of the Faith by its followers in East and West, by the recognition of that status at its world center, by the pronouncement of the Council of the League of Nations testifying to the justice of its claims, by a remarkable expansion of its international teaching activities and its


<p141>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 141

  literature, by the testimonials of royalty to its Divine origin, and by the completion of the exterior ornamentation of its first House of Worship in the western world. 

 The tribulations attending the progressive unfoldment of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have indeed been such as to exceed in gravity those from which the religions of the past have suffered. 

 Unlike those religions, however,  these tribulations have failed utterly to impair its uflity, or to create, even temporarily, a breach in the ranks of its adherents.  It has not oniy survived these ordeals, bitt has emerged, purified and inviolate,  endowed with greater capacity to face and surmount any crisis which its resistless march may engender in the future. 

 Mighty indeed have been the tasks accomplished and the victories achieved by this sorely-tried yet undefeatable Faith within the space of a century! Its unfinished tasks, its future victories, as it stands on the threshold of the second Baha'i century, are greater still. 

 In the brief space of the first hundred years of its existence it has succeeded  in diffusing its light over five continents, in erecting its outposts in the furthermost  corners of the earth, in establishing, on an impregnable basis its Covenant with all mankind, in rearing the fabric of its world-encompassing Administrative Order, in casting  off many of the shackles hindering its total emancipation and worldwide recogni-ton, in registering its initial victories over royal, political and ecclesiastical adversaries, and in launching the first of its systematic crusades for the spiritual conquest of the whole planet. 

 The institution, however, which is to constitute the last stage in the erection of the framework of its world Administrative Order, functioning in close proximity to its world spiritual center, is as yet unestablished. The full emancipation of the Faith itself from the fetters of religious orthodoxy, the essential prerequisite of its universal recognition  and of the emergence of its World Order, is still unachi4ved. 

 The successive campaigns, designed to extend the beneficent influence of its System, according to 'Abdu'l-Baha's  Plan, to every country and island where the structural basis of its Administra dYe Order has not been erected, still remain to be launched. The banner of Y~ Bah6.'-u'1-Abh& which, as foretold by Him, must float from the pinnacles of the foremost seat of learning in the Islamic world is still un-hoisted.  The Most Great House, ordained as a center of pilgrimage by Baha'u'llah in His Kitab-i-Aqdas, is as yet unliberated. 

The third Mashriqu'l-Adhkar

 to be raised to His glory, the site of which has recently been acquired, as well as the Dependencies of the two Houses of Worship already erected in East and West, are as yet unbuilt. The dome, the final unit which, as anticipated by 'Abdu'l-Baha, is to crown the Sepulcher of the Bab is as yet unreared. The codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of the Baha'i Revelation, and the systematic promulgation of its laws and ordinances, are as yet unbegun. The preliminary measures for the institution of Baha'i courts, invested with the legal right to apply and execute those laws and ordinances, still remain to be undertaken. 

 The restitution of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Baha'i world and the recreation of the community that so devotedly  reared it, have yet to be accomplished. 

 The sovereign who, as foreshadowed in Baha'u'llah's Most Holy Book, must adorn the throne of His native land, and cast the shadow of royal protection over His long-persecuted followers, is as yet undiscovered. The contest that must ensue as a result of the concerted onslaughts which, as prophesied  by 'Abdu'l-Baha, are to be delivered by the leaders of religions as yet indifferent to the advance of the Faith, is as yet unfought.  The Golden Age of the Faith itself that must witness the unification of all the peoples and nations of the world, the estab-lisliment of the Most Great Peace, the inauguration  of the Kingdom of the Father upon ear di, the coming of age of the entire human race and the birth of a world civilization, inspired and directed by the creative energies released by Baha'u'llah's 'World Order, shining in its meridian splendor, is still unborn and its glories unsuspected. 

 'Whatever may befall this infant Faith of God in future decades or in succeeding centuries, whatever the sorrows, dangers and tribulations which the next stage in its


<p142>
142             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  worldwide development may engender, from whatever quarter the assaults to be launched by its present or future adversaries may be unleashed against it, however great the reverses and setbacks it may suffer, we, who have been privileged to apprehend, to the degree our finite minds can fathom, the significance of these marvelous phenomena associated with its rise and establishment, can harbor no doubt that what it has already achieved in the first hundred years of its life provides sufficient guarantee that it will continue to forge ahead, capturing loftier heights, tearing down every obstacle, opening  up new horizons and winning still mightier victories until its glorious mission, stretching into the dim ranges of time that lie ahead, is totally fulfilled.

               A WORLD SURVEY OF THE
               BAHA'I FAITH — 18441944

  A SURVEY of the international Baha'i community made by 

Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian

 appointed by 'Abdu'l-Baha, has been summarized in a statement received by the National Spiritual Assembly which provides the essential facts of the present spread and facilities of the faith, now celebrating the one-hundredth anniversary of its birth in Persia. 

 Baha'is have established residence in seventy-eight countries, fifty-six of them being sovereign states. 

 Baha'i literature has been translated and published in forty-one languages. 

 Baha'i literature in addition is being translated  into twelve more languages.

    Five different National   

 Baha'i Assemblies, and sixty-one local Baha'i Assemblies located in ten different countries, have become incorporated and legally empowered as reli-. gious societies to hold property. 

    The international Baha'i  

 endowments now held in Palestine have an estimated value of onehalf million pounds sterling. 

 The national Baha'i endowments held in the United States at present are considered to be worth one million, seven hundred thousand dollgrs. 

 The area of land in the Jordan Valley dedicated to the Baha'i shrines in Palestine is over five hundred acres. 

 The site purchased for the future Baha'i Temple in Persia comprises three and onehalf  million square meters. 

 The cost of the structure of the first Baha'i Temple in the West, located on Lake Michigan near Chicago, has up to the present  amounted to one million three hundred thousand dollars. 

 Baha'i Assemblies are functioning in every state and province of North America. 

 Members of the Faith reside in thirteen hundred localities of the United States and Canada. 

 in five states of the United States, officers of Baha'i Assemblies have been authorized by the civil authorities to conduct legal marriage rites according to the Baha'i form. 

 Baha'i Centers have been established in every republic of Latin America, fifteen of which now possess Spiritual 

Assembly.                 
     In the Western Hemisphere 

 the Faith of Baha'u'llah now stretches from Anchorage, Alaska, to Magallanes, the world's southernmost  city. 

 Sixty-two Baha'i centers have been established in India, twenty-seven having a Spiritual  Assembly. 

 Among the Baha historic sites purchased in Persia are: the home of Baha'u'llah in TihrAn; the Bib's shop in Biishihr the burial place of Quddiis; a portion of the village of Chihriq; three gardens in Badasht; the place where TThirih was confined. 

 National Baha administrative headquarters  have been founded in Tihr~n, Persia; Delhi, India; Cairo, 

Egypt; Baghd4d, 'Iraq;    

 Wilmette, Illinois; and Sydney. Australia.

150             THE BAHA'I WORLD

               CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS
                  IN THE HOLY LAND

                 B~ RUHfYYIH KHANT3M

  THE Centenary came upon us very much like the sunrise which, long before our parent  orb soars above the horizon, casts its premonitory rays over the earth and awakes and excites the face of creation. 

 First it was the entering of the one hundred and first year of our history, on March 2 1st, 1944, that made our pulses beat quicker, for the glorious time was near. Then it was just ahead of us. Hearts began to sing with expectation; our paces accelerated; daily tasks began to glow in the Light of expectation  — the very hours seemed to be running on swifter feet to meet the Day of Days, May 2 2nd. We were enveloped in a veritable storm of rushing and as the eve before  that sacred eve that saw the inception of the Baha'i Era fell, preparations were moving to a climax; already the pilgrims had arrived; already the rooms and halls were spotless and waiting to welcome the throng of believers who would pour in on the morrow; already the Shrines were adorned with candlesticks and vases to receive the lights and the flowers destined for the great feast on the following night. 

 There was little sleep for any one — for what need had we of sleep at such a time as this? We were riding the wave of joy that the celebrations cast before them. Everything must be perfect. Messages must be delivered to this and that person, last minute instructions carried out, the final polishing applied to everything in sight, the hundreds and hundreds of roses, freshly cut, placed in water that they might be in their prime next day. 

 Over a hundred and fifty Baha'is gathered during the morning and afternoon of the 2 2nd. A great tent, a gift of the Indian believers during 'Abdu'l-Baha's lifetime, had been pitched near the Oriental Pilgrim House on Mt. Carmel as a meeting place for the women and children. 

 The opening ceremony of the centenary commemoration was to take place at exactly two hours and eleven minutes after sunset, in the Shrine of the beloved Martyr Prophet of Shir~z, at the very moment when one hundred years earlier He had said to the youthful Mulli Ijusayn "Behold, all these signs are manifest in me!" and had then proceeded, with dignity  and majesty, to lift the veil on a new era in human history. 

 The Guardian had already proceeded after dusk to the Holy Tombs to himself arrange the disposition of the flowers and lights. With his own hands he had copiously sprinkled the thresholds and floors with the fragrant and intense perfume made of the essence of damask roses. The believers were then summoned, the women entering the eastern, the men the western, side of the 13~b's Shrine. 

 As the men tiled past the Guardian he anointed the hand of each with that same sweet scented oil. 

 What a vision greeted our eyes as we entered the door! The whitewashed walls, the simple arches curving above the two thresholds of the inner shrine of the BTh, (which face each other and permit a full view of the floor beneath which His body rests), were flooded with brilliant light. The center chandelier, crystal, ~oid and blue, hung glistening with candles; on either side of it electrically lighted chandeliers blazed; beneath the apex of each arch over the two thresholds globes of pale roseate glass glowed; at the head and at the foot of His resting place great candelabra raised their nine burning fingers in long rows; at the corners of the beautiful paisiey shawl stretched in the middle of the rich rugs that cover the floor of this inner shrine stood five-armed candlesticks, making pyramids of flames; along the sides other candles flickered until glass, silver, polished

  brass and light seemed to sparkle from threshold to threshold. Over the wide space thus formed hundreds and hundreds of crimson and apricot-hued roses lay, a veritable carpet of flowers. To the left and right of this band of light and flowers stood two immense, ornate vases from which sprang, fountain-like, huge clusters of deep red leaves and blossoms. The two thresholds were thickly spread with white jasmine on one side and white roses on the other, amidst which were interspersed vases of flowers in vivid tones of red and blue. 

 In the upper corners of the western room stood great bunches of Easter lilies, casting their delicate  and poignant fragrance into the already rose-laden air. 

 It seemed to me at least, (as I gazed into that shimmering crucible of light and color), that mighty, invisible bells were ringing somewhere, in some world we could not see, and that their voices were crying: C!Ring out the old, ring in the new Ring out the false, ring in the true Ring out the want, the care, the sin Ring in the love of truth and right Ring out the thousand wars of old, Ring in the thousand years of peace." 

  Ring out the old, ring in the new! in peal on peal of joyous thunder. 

 One hundred years of glory — but of bloodshed, of persecution, of abasement —  had passed. 

 A new hundred years was rising up before us, not more blessed — for that could never be — but bringing the seeds of the first to fruition; bringing nearer to the world the day when the Kingdom of God shall come on earth as it is in heaven. 

 As I listened to the voice of the Guardian chanting I thought of the One that lay beneath that flower-strewn brilliant floor; of 1-us youthfulness, His gentleness, His bitter trials and disappointments; of how they put Him before a firing squad and riddled His breast with bullets. 

 I thought of the day the Master, then an old man, with His silvery hair flying about His beautiful  face, had laid the little casket containing  the Bib's earthly remains away for all time in a great marble sarcophagus in the vault beneath that floor, and how He had then bowed His head on its lip and wept and sobbed from an over filled heart until all those who stood in reverence at that solemn moment, wept with Him. 

 How small, how unworthy we seemed to be in that room on such an occasion! 

 Great things come like a thief in the night and find us unprepared and then other men, at other times, look back and say CCWht a blessing for those who were there; what an hour to have been aliVe!' 

 We then left the Shrine of the Bib and entered the adjacent Tomb of 'Abdu'1 — Baha, He who had built that Shrine and who had said that every stone of it had been raised and placed in position through infinite pains on His part and the shedding of many tears. A century had now passed since His birth on the self same night the Bab declared His mission, and the loving hands of the Guardian had decked His tomb, too, with candles and flowers, oniy here the roses were a carpet of deep violet-pink, spreading the whole length of His resting place. 

 On very rare occasions in life is it given to people to climb out of themselves, to surmount for even a few seconds the bonds of time, of self, and the limitations they impose. But for a few brief hours we seemed to have cast the world behind us and become free of the trammels of the flesh. So great was the joy, so simple and compelling the beauty of those moments when we attained the apex of our expectations, when we could, if only for one instant, in one great inner flash, see the panorama of spiritual events in their proper perspective, that it lifted us up into the realm of eternal reality, the World of God, where there is neither past nor present nor future, but only the truth of His creation and the brightness of His worlds of everlasting life. We stood before the GLean of His Bounty — yet how little seemed the measures 'we possessed with which to take away our portion! 

 Slowly the world and its burden of living came back to us and tightened its coils about us once again. We had pilgrimaged our beyond our limitations; for a few hours, (or for a few moments, each according to his own capacity), we had been free; now, happy, excited, grateful, we returned to earth again. 

 Long after midnight the meetings  lasted, the men in the presence of the


<p152>
152             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Guardian,, the women foregathered in the pavilion pitched for them. The friends feasted with elated hearts. Poems and prayers  were chanted and readings from the Centenary Review written by Shoghi Effendi himself for this great anniversary. 

 As we listened, the trials and sufferings of the Founders of our Faith seemed very near and real on this day when their followers the world over were tasting some of the first fruits of triumph. 

 As scenes of sorrow, of bitter deprivation and persecution rose before  us, so too, intermingled with them like light with shadow, was the ever-present pictrnte in the mind's eye of what the believers  elsewhere were doing on this glorious occasion! 

 The friends gathered in the white Mother Temple of the West, radiant, joyous faces, representative of all North America, every State and every Province, and those of the Latin American Republics too, gazing for the first time on western soil, in the New World, on the portrait of the holy Bab; the lofty-domed auditorium of the Temple hugging them in a peace and security known to the outer world. 

 The Indian believers, excited, enthused, reaping the reward of a truly stupendous effort which swept the Cause forward within the space of a few years into many virgin States, and multiplied centers and assemblies in an almost miracu-bus  manner. 

 The British friends, convening their convention and courageously and determinedly  launching upon a weeklong public 

Centenary Exhibition      

 in the heart of bombed and endangered London. 

 The Egyptian  Baha'is, foregathered in their newly completed National Administrative Headquarters, proudly stepping forth in their true colors in a mighty stronghold of IsUm. The 'Ir&q believers, firm, devoted, persevering, holding their celebrations likewise in their own Headquarters in that city blessed beyond measure of Baha'u'llah's revelation of His glory in one of its gardens. And last, but not by any means least, our thoughts hovered about that little House in Shir~z where He, the Mb, declared Himself, now the Mecca of the eager Persian representatives  of His Faith who pilgrimaged there to do Him honor, to glorify His humility, to beweep His sufferings, to laud His precious life, to recall His sorrows and death, and to place on the floor of the room in which He first asserted His world-shaking claims, a silken carpet in the name of "Shoghi, the Servant of His Threshold", as well as to convene, during nine days, their annual convention  in the precincts of that scared House. 

 Though the center of the Faith was deprived,  because of war, of welcoming on a befitting scale representatives from distant parts of the Baha'i world, yet did it receive a full portion of blessing and give out, once again, to the body of the Cause that never-failing  animus which, ever since Baha'u'llah's arrival in 'Akka in 1868, has radiated from this unique spot. As the heart pumps blood with force and strength to the furthermost capillaries of the system, so the Guardian distributed to all the members of the Baha'i world news, glad tidings, hopes and instructions for the future. It was so thrilling to hear, (it was almost vocal, the sense of nearness was so acute), the news that poured in from the delegates in all the 

Baha'i conventions,  East 

 and West; reports of successes, numbers, new undertakings, good wishes, requests for prayers, expressions of devotion and gratitude. 

 Time and space faded away and we all seemed to be in the same place inwardly, as indeed, we are, if we but saw with the eye of the spirit. 

 May the 23rd, our festivities continued on Mt. Carmel; in the morning the women, in the afternoon, the men, visited the International Archives. With what memories we gazed upon the portraits of the Bib and Baha'u'llah. 

 Their writings, their robes, their relics appeared in a new light. How swiftly the hundred years seemed to have passed as I held the precious dress of the Mb in my hands, of green taffeta —  (green beloved by Him no doubt as the emblem of His sacred lineage, His kinship to Mul?ammad). His hair was there too, a few short, fine, brown strands; parings from His nails, kept for over ninety years by devout followers of His; a little box containing fragments of wood from the original casket enclosing His remains and which had been preserved since the day 'Abdu'l-Baha entombed them for the last time. 

 It seemed as if oniy a few days ago He must have been alive and walking

  the streets of $hir4z — not possibly a whole century ago! As we all gathered close to view these historic mementos of the martyr Prophet of our Faith, we could feel the times changing. 

 Some there were amongst us who had known Baha'u'llah Himself, daughters of one of his half-brothers; one, the oldest of these, had herself from her childhood waited upon the mother of 'Abdu'l-Baha  and been with her when she died and had likewise been present in the Mansion, at Baha, during Baha'u'llah's last illness and when 

He ascended. Already       

 those days of nearness were receding; when these old women passed away who would stand amongst us and with weeping eyes say t~yes, I remember seeing that in His hand Most of the adults present had known 'Abdu'l-Baha personally for long years. 

 But soon that generation too will be rolled away into the past and no living memory amongst us recall Him. 'We all felt our privilege very keenly as we gazed on these things in the archives, which are at present lodged in the rooms adjoining the BTh's and the Master's tombs. 

 From the days when Baha'u'llah resided  in Baha, and these old women had entered His presence and seen these very tAjs, we now looked upon with such reverence,  on His own blessed head, there was already a gap. We younger ones looked upon them with envious eyes. You saw the face of the Prophet! 

 You waited on, listened to the voice of, and received gifts from, the King of Kings! And it was oniy day before yesterday! 

 Already the day before that is gone. No one is left who can touch the relics of the Rib with tremulous lips and flowing eyes and say "I saw Him!" 

 And yesterday is gone too. Though so many knew the beloved Master, though so many present had received their names and the names of their chidren from Him and had still in their homes many a gift of His, or a tablet, or something used by Him — yet for us who are younger is that a closed door too, now. 

 That was yesterday, gone for ever. The Perfect Exemplar is laid away to rest. 100 years ago He was born. These are His things, these the shoes, the fez, the robes, the watch He wore — but He is gone. And even as we perceived these things we perceived our own privileges too. 

 Our day too has its special sweetness, for we are still near. 

 Near in point of time to these three glorious figures, and very near and folded still in the intimate phase of the Cause. We enter within the Shrines; we stand close, close to the sacred resting places; we are near the Guardian; he comes to us,speaks to the friends, chants in the Holy Tombs, walks the garden paths; the pilgrims cluster behind  him, ask their questions, are often alone with him day after day and have his discourse  and his presence all to themselves. 

 And yet, in thirtyfive years, what immense  changes have swept over Mt. Carmel since 'Abdu'l-Baha laid the Rib's body to rest in 

1909. The Master Himself   

 is now laid away beneath the floor of the adjoining shrine — but this we know is not His permanent  resting place. 

Two Oriental Pilgrim Houses

 are built in the vicinity of the Tomb, one during His days, one added by the Guardian. But these, we may well suppose, will some day give way to the requirements of a far greater inflow of pilgrims. The terraces the Master envisaged, and Himself commenced, now stretch from the Shrines to almost join the main road of the German Colony — but they are but a skeleton, constructed by Shoghi Effendi in anticipation of the mighty scheme of approach to the Rib's Sepulchre which must some day be undertaken. 

 On the other side of the main highway, running now to the crest of Mt. Carmel and passing behind the Shrines, are the newiy laid out gardens which surround the beautiful monuments marking the graves of the Master's Family, all built since His sister passed away in 1932, and where His mother, His brother and His wife now also rest. 

 Change is swiftly sweeping over this old mountain of the prophets. Since the day when Baha'u'llah pointed with His own hand to the spot, and instructed His beloved Son to bring the BAt's body and bury it there, events have leaped forward. We can only suppose they will go on doing so at an ever increasing tempo. 

  From the crown of the mountain to the German colony at its foot the lands of the Shrine now stretch, approximately 140,000 square meters, all permanently dedicated to the Bab's Resting Place and exempted from taxation by Government and Municipality alike.


<p154>
154             THE BAFIA'I WORLD

  So as we intimately visited the archives, held our meetings informally together, and saw what the requirements of almost two hundred people were, our minds naturally turned to the future and we envisioned the days, perhaps nearer than we realize, when thousands will be pilgrims, and the days beyond those days, hanging as yet on the dim fringes of time, when millions will be pilgrims. And our celebrations seemed infinitely  near and precious, and we knew the time was not far off when others would be envying us our days as we envied those who said ~ remember when Baha'u'llah wore that in the Mansion" or "I remember when the Master returned with those from America. ~ On the afternoon of the 23rd the Guardian  recapitulated (in the men~s meeting) the thrilling and moving history of the remains of the Mb from that black night when, following upon His martyrdom, they were thrown out on the edge of the moat of Tabriz for animals to devour and were later rescued and concealed for sixty lunar years, through the direct and unsparing vigilance of both Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, till they were finally entombed by the Master himself. 

 For those six decades they were a heavy, one might almost say a heart-break-ing, load on their• minds. 

 Moved from place to place; always in the gravest danger should their whereabout become known to the enemies of the Faith; at one time their repository broken open by thieves; at another  their exact place of concealment lost to the knowledge of all save Baha'u'llah, and a very few of His relatives, who were in exile with Him, they made the journey, secret, circuitous, over half a century in duration, from Tabriz to Haifa in security. Now, on the Centenary of the Bib's 

Declaration,  the Guardian

 announced for the first time that a design had been made at his instruction and accepted by him for the completed structure of the Shrine, comprising a columned arcade enclosing the original building on four sides and surmounted by a lofty dome, resting on an intermediary eight-sided story. This concept was pursuant with the wishes of 'Abdu'l-Baha's who had desired that the building should be surmounted by a dome. But not one stone of the stones hiessed by his tears and labours should ever be removed. His structure was the core, sacred and precious beyond the embellish-merits of art, and it was now to be enclosed in a shell of beauty befitting the station and glory of the bioved Martyr-Herald of our Faith, and yet revealing the original building on all sides. 

 This announcement, accompanied by an exhibition of the model, was made together with the glad tidings that the next and third Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Baha'i world would be constructed, circumstances permitting,  in Tihr~n on the large area of land already purchased for that purpose by the Persian friends, and that these two mighty tasks were amongst the first undertakings which must be launched upon in the course of the second Baha'i century. 

 After another visit — at the hour of twilight  — to the twin tombs of the Rib and the Master, the Baha'is, men and women, gathered in the hail of the Oriental Pilgrim House to hear the record of a prayer chanted by 'Abdu'l-Baha and to view the motion picture taken of Him in 1912 during His visit to America. 

 The majestic figure, with unutterably sweet and beautiful face and the sad and loving eyes, moved the hearts of us all. 

 This was followed by colored lantern slides showing views of the Baha'i Temple in Wilmette, the friends gathered on its steps at convention time, the National Baha Headquarters, various conferences and summer  school groups, and other Baha'i prop-eWes. 

 Gasps of delight and enthusiasm could be heard as the believers gazed on the great white House of Worship resting on green swards, flanked by the blue waters of Lake Michigan, and surrounded by lofty trees. 

 On May the 24th, all the pilgrims and believers proceeded to Babji, near 'Akka, where, in the afternoon, the final meeting of our centennial celebrations was held in the shadow of Baha'u'llah's Tomb. 

 The Baha'is, gathered about the Guardian on the lawn, listened to his discourse on the progress made by the Faith and to the narrative of those trials and episodes that distinguished the lifetime  of 'Abdu'l-Baha, many of which were vivid in the memories of those present. As the sun westered into the sea, we entered the Holy Tomb.


<p155>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 155

  Green and white wove a pattern of peace and calm into the gathering dusk of the interior.  The bushes and vines and tall, slender trees stood still and ethereal in the little center garden. 

 Only the small inner room of the Shrine, beneath the floor of which Baha'u'llah's remains rest, was brilliantly lighted with flickering candles, oldfashioned frosted globe chimney lamps and electricity, the nature of the outer room, with its large skylights, precluding any illumination there owing to the blackout regulations. 

 It was His Faith's anniversary we were celebrating. We came to Him with hearts full of gratitude and realization. 

 The Bib had said: CCF all that hath been exalted in the Bayin is but as a ring upon My hand, and I Myself am, verily, but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest He turneth it as He pleaseth, for whatsoever  He pleaseth, and through whatsoever He picaseth." And yet the one hundred years gone by were from the declaration of His Herald's mission. 

 This was not really Baha'u'llah's anniversary; that would come in 1963. 1963 — what would His Faith have given to the world by then? 

 We stood under the shadow of war, in a darkness brought by war. 

 All the evil, all the ruin and sorrow and suffering He had cautioned us against for forty years, the godlessness, perversity and blindness He had seen waxing within men's hearts, had come to fruition. The centenary of our Cause had fallen in the midst of a world convulsion that carried on its flood waters ever greater treasures of our youth, our wealth, our optimism, our hopes away into oblivion. In the nineteen years ahead, before we again gathered for a hundredth anniversary in His Holy Tomb, what of good and ill would befall humanity? How much would the Baha'is accomplish during these two priceless decades that lay before them? 

 We had done much  —  and yet so little! 'Well over half a century ago Baha' —  u'11&h had written: C(And if the friends had been doing that which they were commanded,  now most of those on earth would be adorned with the robe of faith." 

 Somewhere in the past there had been giievous failures on our part. 
Would we now take wing?   

 Would we at last become completely, utterly Baha'is, men of the New Creation, breathing the rarified air of those mountain tops Baha'u'llah discovered to our eyes and whose paths He had laid down for our feet? Everything we had: There before us, strong, assured, tried in the fires of suffering and tempered to a fine point, stood our leader, our Guardian. Both we and the Cause were safe in such hands as his. 

 A doer to his finger tips; a man of vision, iron determination, indomitable courage; a man who never hesitated before any danger or compromised with any circumstance, however  overpowering and compelling it might teem to be. In a world of halftones, of muddied values, his standard was fleckless, his eye sharp and true, his voice unfaltering. 

 Our treasury was full: A wealth of literature was ours, neither open to question as to authenticity nor open to misinterpretation. 

 Our foundation was laid by the blood of martyrs, by the spread of the Faith for a hundred years until almost every land on the planet had received some tiding of its message. 

 Our Administration, thanks to the tireless and persistent insistence of Shoghi Effendi, bad at last emerged from its em —  bryonic state and was rapidly growing into the suitable medium it was designed to be for the expression of Baha'i community life and the furtherance of the welfare of mankind.  Youth marched under our banner. The insignificant, the obscure, the unqual —  ified bad discovered, particularly during the last seven years of teaching enterprise in the New World, that the Cause of Baha'u'llah was a golden talisman that opened doors no humble  man ever dreamed he would pass through. We had begun to taste the sweetness of the power God confers on those who go forth to serve Him and had seen indeed that CCshould a man, all alone, arise in the name of Baha and put on the armor of His love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious, though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed against him." We had come to know that there are spiritual as well as physical laws in this world and that our Faith can launch the frailest bark into the wildest torrent and yet steer it safely to victory. 

 The measure of success or the measure of failure which the next nineteen years must

 What do we Baha'is intend to do? How firmly are we going to grasp the sword of action? How daring are our hearts? Victory, like Spring, must come, but will it be our victory or that of others, who will look back with scorn and pity on us and say that such an opportunity as lay between the years 1944 and 1963 the Baha of those days let slip between their fingers!

 HOLLEY    

  MAY 23rd, 1944, marks the completion of a century so illimitable in its promise for the future of humanity, that neither we who have glimpsed its brilliance, nor the world which sustains the impact of its force, c~n truly claim to have grasped more than a fragment of its import. However earnestly we ponder the Baha'i Faith, — ttrhat priceless gem of Divine Revelation enshrining the Spirit of God and incarnating His Purpose for mankind in this age,"~ we can oniy partially conceive the majestic process inaugurated  by Baha'u'llah or our part in its unfoldment at this pivotal hour. For ours is a climax never to be repeated: the struggle of birth to project on this planet the very body of humanity, the organic and universal  Form in which for untold centuries the spirit of man has sought to clothe itself. Whether we be conscious of it or not, ours is the delicate and challenging task to participate  in "the unification of the whole world, the final object and the crowning glory of human evolution." 

 Nothing that we see, as we look back upon fifty years of Baha'i history on this continent, is unrelated to this tremendous mission. 

 No preparation which our nation has undergone for leadership; no experience, suffering, doubt, or achievement through which the American people have passed; no smallest project or inconspicuous aspiration of the American Baha'i Community; no heroic endeavor, no mighty and ceshining deeds" but have borne their own direct relation  to the unfolding process of World Order and World Civilization.

 out and been invested with a unique, inescapable, a weighty and most sacred responsibility." 

 Tonight we are met to appraise America s heritage as the citadel of universal peace. Already, through previous speakers, we have seen the planting in North America of the potent seed of Baha'u'llah's Revelation. 

 We have watched its rootage in faithful hearts, and seen them bestirred to remarkable activity. 

 We have witnessed with awe and humility  the results of 'Abdu'l-Baha's journey and ceaseless exertions. And now we come to the climax of the Master's labors, His ctclarion call" sounded in ttthose destiny-shaping Tablets" of the Divine Plan "where-in,  in bold relief, stands outlined the world mission entrusted to the American Baha'i 

Community."               

 Although we have just completed in the Seven Year Plan the preliminary stage of this vast assignment, learning through the strenuous  period of its development some hint of what it means to labor for the triumph of God's Cause, yet the full significance of these words from the Guardian can oniy be guessed: "The promulgation of the Divine Plan," he wrote in 1936, "... is the key which Providence has placed in the hands of the American believers whereby to unlock  the doors leading them to fulfill their unimaginably glorious Destiny." 

 We are too close to this unseen but all-compelling process. For seven years we have moved to its rhythm, manifested its influence, hungered for its goals, and demonstrated  all unwittingly its latent power. The victories we have won, the territories of our conquest, the key cities which brighten the horizon of the Western Hemisphere, the swelling ranks of erthe heavenly armies" of

  Baha'u'llah — all these proclaim the confirming  and irresistible energy of a Plan which enshrines, in every phrase and conception, the Divine Will for the uniting of nations in this Promised 

Day.                      
   ~     ye heavenly heralds!"

 these world-creating messages began. !!Bebold the portals which Baha'u'llah hat/a opened before you! Consider how exalted and lofty is the station  you are destined to attain. The full measure of your sir cress is as yet unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended. 

 I fervently hope that in the near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your achievements." 

 From the first moment of their appearance, the Tablets of the Divine Plan carried a life-imparting force. Conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the dark course of the first World War, from March 26th to April 11th, 1916, and from February 2nd to April 22nd, 1917, they were designed in two matchless cycles, each consisting of seven Tablets, addressed to the five regions of the Northeastern, Southern, 

Central, and Western      
States, and Canadian Provinces;

 and to the "Ae bit and Meetings," the "believers and maidservants  in the U. S. and Canada." 

 Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the ~eo pie to the Kin gdoin of God Thus through this superhuman service the rays of peace and conciliation may illumine and enlighten all the regions and the world of humanity may find peace and composure." This was the essence of the Master's call, as He arrayed for our support the methods of victory, enumerated every far-flung goal, quickened our spirits with heavenly ambition, and revealed  for our daily sustenance nine prayers of unexcelled beauty and might. 

 The first regenerating impulse of 'Abdu'l-Baha's work in far-off Palestine seems to have been reflected in the Eighth Baha'i Con


<p160>

  vention of 1916, although no outward sign reached this country for several months. Every session, so runs the record, carried a vision of "the new kingdom which is to appear upon the earth," while "the gales of the Holy Spirit swept the room at times like the rushing of a mighty wind." The effect of the earliest Tablets published in September, 1916, was instantaneous. Within three months reports were coming from ttsoldiers at the front," while the Ninth Convention envisioned the initial framework of teaching on a national scale. 

 Not until 1919, however, did the American  Baha'is witness the complete and glor-jous  panorama of the Divine Plan, released to the sessions of a Convention which 'Abdu'l-Baha  Himself described as "the Convention of the Covenant." It was the signal for one of the brightest chapters of teaching history. In a few years the Cause of Baha'u'llah  "encircled the globe, encompassing thereby the whole earth with a girdle of shining glory." "Forsaking home, kindred, friends and position," the Guardian has written, tta handful of men and women, fired with a zeal and confidence which no human agency can kindle, arose to carry out the mandate which 'Abdu'l-Baha had issued: Martha Root, ttstar~servant~~ the "first" and "finest fruit" of the Formative Age; Hyde Dunn, ccAustra1ia~s spiritual conqueror"; and all those other "stout — hearted disciples" who hastened in the closing years of the Master's life to implant the Faith in such distant regions as Alaska, the West Indies, South America, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand,  and Tasmania. 

 But brilliant as were their exploits, and however great our pride in such instant response by the American Baha'is, it is a fundamental fact that the Divine Plan was to undergo "a period of incubation of well-nigh twenty years while the machinery of a divinely-appointed  Administrative Order was being laboriously devised and its processes set in motion." For long, under the guidance of Shoghi Effendi, our efforts were committed to other tasks — the erection of administrative institutions and the completion of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 Their bearing upon the Tablets of the Divine Plan we scarcely grasped, or that of America's world mission would be vast and demanding beyond the vision or capacity of individuals to discharge. 

 Yet how otherwise, save by an all-encompassing effort of collective will, save by tcutter~~ and "continuous consecration" and the harnessing of ~aI1 available resources," should we hope to accomplish the rebirth and reorganization of mankind? 

 The intimations of a new era in the progress  of the Faith began to sound through the Guardian's messages from 193 2, when the deeds of the Dawn-Breakers first opened to our view in the stirring pages of Nabil. This book, the (cessential adjunct to (a) reconstructed teaching program," stirred latent longings soon to find release through Shoghi Effendi's pleas "to the American believers,  the spiritual descendants of the heroes of God's ~ ttThe flew hour has struck," he cabled in 1935, t!calling for nationwide, systematic, sustained efforts in teaching field." 

 Painstakingly he prepared us. Yet who could guess, at the Convention of 1936, the whole thrilling and terrible pathway which beckoned the Faith and the world, jn the closing years of the first Baha'i century? ~ entering outer fringes most perilous  stage its existence. Opportunities (of) present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic  and every Republic in American continent might ere termination this glorious century embrace (the) light (of the) Faith of Baha'u'llah and establish structural basis of His 

World Order."              

 From such a summons there was no return!  In that hour the American Community embarked upon the fulfillment of the Divine Plan, embodying their pledge in an initial phase, the Seven Year Plan, adopted in 1937. 

 It was the signal for intercontinental  expansion, and for an unprecedented growth in North America destined to eclipse the achievements of forty previous years of Baha'i history. 

 A Faith which, for so long a period, had been administratively confined within the boundaries of twenty-six States and 

Provinces  (including Hawaii

 and the District of Columbia), now dared the conquest in seven years of the remaining thirty-four areas of the United States, Canada, and Alaska. With


<p161>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 161

  evermounting strength it engulfed the land, claiming by 1939 the ten virgin areas which had lacked even a single Baha'i; going on to initiate far-flung projects and campaigns; perfecting its instruments in local, regional, and national teaching committees; organizing  methods of stimulus and support; and calling into the ranks of its ~~trai1breakers" a swiftly growing host of pioneers and settlers  — ttveteran believers" and ceneophytes~~ c%talwart warriors" of "every class, race, age and outlook" — who contributed the decisive share to this vast enterprise. 

 No one who participated in the Seven Year Plan can ever forget its momentum, the peaks of confirmation, of exhilarating triumph; the taut and perplexing crises; the obstacles hurled up by depression and war; the perilous threat of ioss which was met and surmounted in the sixth year; until finally, on March 28, 1944, the cycle was crowned in glorious victory! Strenuous and rich was this experience, whose every year returns to memory endowed with a bright particular tale. 
     What, then, was accomplished?

 Statisti-. cally it is a compelling record: the conquest of thirty-four virgin States and Provinces'~ through the formation of thirty-eight 

Local Spiritual Assemblies;
the increase of functioning 

Assemblies in North America

 from seventy to one hundred and thirty-six; eight times as many groups as in 1937, and three and a half tim~s the number of isolated Baha'is; with participation in the campaign by 293 pioneers and 336 members of Regional 

Committees.                

 Yet, if we estimate the Seven Year Plan alone in quantitative terms, we shall forego its profoundest goals, revealed from month to month in the surging outpour of the Guardian's words. To Shoghi Effendi ours was no ordinary teaching program. tCGod~S own Plan has been set in motion," he affirmed.  "It is gathering momentum with every passing day." cc~ Whatever may befall  them in the future they should, at ne time forget that the synchronization of such world-shaking crises with the progressive unfoldment and fruition of their divinely-appointed task is itself the work of Providence, the design of an inscrutable To which Colorado was later added. 

 Wisdom, and the purpose of an all-compel-ling Will Reflections such as these should steel the resolve of the entire Baha'i community,  and arouse them to rededicate themselves to every single provision of that Divine Charter whose outline has been delineated  for them by the pen of 'Abdu'l-Baha." 

 Tonight, we acclaim with grateful hearts the consummation of this ttcrowning crusade," the ttgreatest collective enterprise ever launched in the course of the history of the Faith of Baha'u'llah." We have reached the first milepost in the unfoldment of America's  spiritual destiny. 

 Around us, in this great Convention Hall, is proof of our effort. The fruits garnered in every virgin State and Province are here represented. The sessions of this All-America Convention rest, for the first momentous time, on the ~~structural basis" of Baha'u'llah's World Order. "The record" is "complete, the roll call filled, and the mighty task victoriously concluded." It is in hours like these that the potency of the Baha'i Faith is unveiled to our eyes. What words can ever express our privilege, to be its supporters in the day of upbuilding? 

 Only seven swiftly-passing years are measure  of America's devotion to the enthralling vision of the Divine Plan. In that brief space the Cause of Baha'u'llah has been forever anchored to our native soil. Yet, in the estimate of the Guardian, tcthe immensity of the task still to be performed staggers our fancy and inflames our' imagination." 

 For the course of the second century is destined to carry the American believers "beyond the W"estern Hemisphere to the uttermost ends of the earth." 

 With the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who has blessed our continent with tciitl primacy" and linked its fortunes to the unfolding  power of His Covenant, I close: rerhe hope which 'Abdu'l-Baha cherishes for you is that the same success which has attended  yoitr efforts in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of the world, that through you the fame of the Cause of God may be diffused throughout the East and the West and the ad&eut of the Kingdom  of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five ccmtinents of the globe. 

 Please God, ye may achieve it."

 Guest Speaker          MRS. STUART W. FRENCH There can be no doubt whatever that the peoples of the world, of whatever race or religion, derive their inspiration from one heavenly Source, and are the subjects of one God. The difference between the ordinances under which they abide should be attributed to the varying requirements and exigencies of the age in which they were revealed. Arise and, armed with the power of faith, shatter to pieces the gods of your vain imaginings, the sowers of dissension amongst you. Cleave unto that which draweth you together and uniteth you.

  The vitality of men's belief in God is dying out in every land; nothing short of His wholesome e medicine can ever restore it. The corrosion of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human society; what else but the Elixir of His potent Revelation can ever cleanse and revive it? The Word of God, alone, can claim the distinction of being endowed with the capacity required for so great and far-reaching a change.

  Excerpts from Words of Welcome by MR.   HARRY C. KINNE, Chairman, 

 Wilinette Village Board   

  Mr. Chairman, members and friends : — It is indeed a pleasure and an honor for me to address you on the opening of the meeting of your anniversary celebration, and to welcome the many guests as well as my friends and neighbors this evening Please feel w:lcorne When people ask me where is Wilmette? I tell them: "jf you want to locate 'XJilmette, just locate the Baha'i Temple. There is where Wilmette is!" 

 We, in Wilmette, regard the Baha'i Tern-pie  as a great monument and a great influence  for good in our immediate community 

     SPECIAL SESSI LATIN-AMERICAN
as well as in our State.  

 It would, indeed, be an unpleasant task to serve as President of a Village where there are no churches One cannot serve the public without recognizihg and being grateful for the influence of these fine institutions; neither can one who so serves forget the aid and assistance rendered by the many good citizens of this community who are Baha'is. 

 This institution has cooperated with us in every possible way, and I am glad to appear  before you to thank you all for that cooperation. 

 On behalf of our Board, I am glad to greet you and to wish you the continued success and influence which you so richly deserve.

               FROM JULY 9 TO 15, 1944

  THE Latin American delegates who could not get their transportation matters arranged in time to get here for the Centenary Convention  were extended an invitation by the National Spiritual Assembly to attend a special centenary session held for them from July 9th to the 16th, 1944. It was an echo of the convention which vibrated that same intense spirit of unity, love and brotherhood expressed amongst all the friends, and that same profound reverence and awe felt upon seeing the majesty and beauty of the Temple and the portrait of the Mb. 

 Through the careful and excellent planning of the Centenary  Committee and the kindness and hospitality  of the friends in the Temple area, this special session was a great success. 

  The honored guests were: Sr. Salvador Tormo, Argentina Srta. Clara Luz Montalvo, 

El Salvador                
     Sr. Eduardo Gonzales Lopez,

Then followed the showing of the portrait of the BTh, this also in Foundation Hall. After the friends were seated, the recording of the readings of the 

Centenary Commemoration    
meeting was played.        

 At 3:30 p.m. the public meeting was held in Foundation Hall. The speaker was Mrs. Dorothy Baker, on the subject ttA Message for the Americas." Mr. Philip Sprague acted as chairman. 

 Immediately after the public meeting, the delegates met with the National Spiritual Assembly at the Haziratu'1-Quds. 

 At 6 p.m. there was a buffet supper and reception in the Temple, with invitation to the Baha'i friends in the Temple area. At 7:45 an evening program was held in Foundation  Hall. 

 Mr. Allen B. McDaniel acted as chairman. The Latin American representatives were extended a formal greeting and presented with the Centenary souvenir pictures  of 'Abdu'l-Baha and of the Temple.

Second Baha'i Century."    

 Following  this was the playing of the record of 'Abdu'l-Baha's voice, the showing of the film of 'Abdu'l-Baha in America in 1912, and the colored films of the Holy Shrines and the gardens of Mt. Carmel. Explanatory comments about the Holy Shrines and the gardens were made by Miss Jeanne WAles while the film was being shown. 

 All addresses of the evening were translated into Spanish. After the evening meeting, the Latin American representatives and pioneers were again permitted to see the portrait of the Bib and a display of the sacred documents in the archives room. 

 Monday, July 10, 1944 — Pictures of the delegates were taken with the National Spiritual Assembly. In the afternoon, a meeting  of the delegates with Miss Edna True, Miss 

Gwenn Sholtis and Mrs.     

 Gayle Woolson was held to review the votes made by the National Spiritual Assembly in regard to the Latin American teaching work, based on the Consultation had by the Latin American delegates and the National Spiritual Assembly at convention. This meeting was held in preparation for the meeting to be held with the National Spiritual Assembly the following day so as to avoid repetition and to give these delegates an idea of what was already taken up with the National Spiritual Assembly by the delegates who attended the convention. 

 At 6 p.m., the delegates were guests of the Wilmette Community at a picnic supper held on the beach. 

 After the supper the friends gathered together on the Lake Michigan  beach sands and the Latin American friends gave informal talks about their countries and their joy and gratitude felt upon being here. 

    Tuesday, July 11  —  Consultation
and luncheon with the      

National Spiritual Assembly

 Later in the afternoon, all went to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Hautz, after which the supper given at the Milwaukee Center, in collaboration of the four neighbor communities, was attended. After the supper, the Nineteen Day Feast program was Imid, then the Latin American friends were asked to speak. About one hundred persons were present. 

 Friday, July 14 — This day was spent in taking care of transportation matters and getting passports ready for the return trip of the delegates. 

 In spite of the many transportation  obstacles, the efficient handling of these problems by Edna True resulted in excellent arrangements to get the delegates comfortably off on their way to their respective  countries without any delay, even to the expressed amazement of the Pan American  Airways Office. The kind and helpful assistance of Mr. Mattoon was indispensable. 

 In the evening the delegates were dinner guests of the Evanston Community and then an informal meeting was held at the home of Miss Virginia Russell. 

 Mr. Carl Scheffler was requested to speak to the friends about the early days of the establishment of the Cause in North 

America.

 Rising above the sbDre of Lake Micligan at Wilmette, north of Chicago, the first oriental dinner and the seeing of the Centenary Convention films, and the union of the three Americas and Persia represented by the attending friends was a befitting close of this historic occasion. 

 The Latin American delegates were deeply touched and expressed their pro{ound gratitude  and appreciation for the kindness, hospitality and generosity demonstrated by the North American friends. They felt that this experience has brought about a greater spirit of unity cementing the three Americas and that their carrying back this n3w fitt and wider vision will exert great influence in their countries. 

 Mrs. Gayle Woolson served as interpreter and hostess representing the Nafonal Spiritual  Assembly for this session.

The gathering

  than sixteen hundred, including delegates and visitors — there was not space enough in the Foundation Hall of the House of Worship  for all to gather in one group to hear and see the programs. 

 The large overflow had been comfortably accommodated on the audkoriun-i floor where a public-address sys-tern  carried the voices of the speakers and the music to the hundreds gathered under the stately dome. 

  But the Grand Ballroom     

 of the Stevens Hotel was large enough to hold all the Baha Centenary participants at one time. It was a festive and joyous occasion. The immenseness of the gold and crystal room, and the many tables of guests all happily conversing with one another were thrilling to see. One could feel the buoyant spirit borne of joy and hope which pervaded the entire atmosphere; and truly the varied races and nationalities were joined unitedly with one purpose in mind and with fealty to one great and divine Cause. The love and understanding engendered by a world-embracing Faith was pcrfectly exemplified; and those present thrillingly felt the oneness of mankind actually put into practice. 

 It is what can be done when people join their hearts in justice and love under the firm guidance of the principles of Baha'u'llah. 

 During the serving of dinner the soft music of a string ensemble came from the balcony of this beautifully ornamented room. 

 After dinner the program began with a welcoming address by Albert R. Windust of Chicago, the chairman, who brought out the importance of this celebration commemorating the fifty years since the Baha'i Faith was first brought to the attention of the peoples of the Western Hemisphere at the Parliament of Religions of the 'World's Columbian 

Exposition in Chicago.     

 Dr. R. F. Piper of Syracuse, N. Y., the guest-speaker, was the first to address the audience. 
     Following Dr. Piper, Miss  

Elsie Austin, a Baha'i     

 of Washington, D. C., gave an address,  "The Social Basis of 'World Unity," in which she explained the need for the application of the Baha'i tenets as a necessity for the regeneration of human hearts and characters as the first step to a needed social change. 

 Ar nine-thirty a radio broadcast began with a vocal selection by Walter Olitzki of the Metropolitan 

Opera Company of New York  
City. First to talk was    

Alfred Osborne, Inspector  

 of Schools for the Canal Zone, Panama. Mr. Osborne spoke for the number of delegates who came from 

Latin and South America    
and from the West Indies.  

 He stressed unity in diversity as being evidenced by the Baha'is attending the centenary in contrast to the barriers of racial and religious prejudice that are still exercised so generally in the world today. Immediately following, Dr. Fernando Nova of Baha, Brazil, spoke. It was necessary to break his address, because of the termination of radio time, by a. concluding soio, "The Lord's Prayer," by Mr. Olitzki. After this Dr. Nova resumed his address for the banquet audience. 

 More short talks followed; one by a nineteen-year-old Persian youth, a fourth generation Ba-hi'i;  another by Miss Hilda Yen of Chungking, China, who had just recently declared her acceptance of the World Faith of 

Baha'u'llah.              

 To have attended this thrilling Centenary Banquet was a privilege as well as a glorious experience. It was an inspiration to the Ba-hi'is  to continue relentlessly their labors of spreading and strengthening the Baha'i Faith in the Western world.

    MRS. SHIRLEY WARDE         

  WE ARE speaking to you from the ballroom of the Stevens Hotel. As a special broadcast, we are bringing you a portion of the program of the Baha'i banquet which is being held here tonight. This banquet closes the weeklong convention of the Baha'is of the 'Western Hemisphere, and the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the Baha'i Faith. The convention and the anniversary meetings have been held in the Baha'i Temple at Wilmette, the newiy completed house of worship, which has been acclaimed the world's most b2autiful structure and a masterpiece of architecture. 

 Gathered here in the banquet hail are delegates from thirty-one  countries, forty-four states of our nation, and fivc provinces of Canada, from eleven republics of Central and South America,  and even from the far-flung outposts of Alaska and 

Hawaii.                    

 The guests assembled have just heard an address by Dr. Raymond Frank Piper, Professor  of Philosophy, the University of Syracuse. 

 The chairman, Mr. Albert R. Windust, is one of the first Baha'is of Chicago and one of the group who originally conceived the idea of building a great universal house of worship here in the heart of the American continent. 

 Now he is about to introduce the next guest on tonight's program, so we turn our microphone over to Mr. 

Albert Windust.

    ALBERT R. WINDUST          

  We are very happy to be able to share with our friends of the radio audience a portion of this last evening of the moncien-tous  celebration that has brought us all together  from many parts of the world. During the week of our Centenary celebration, we have heard many languages spoken beneath the all-sheltering dome of the Ba-Broadcast Broadcast over station WCFL, Chicago, from~ahi'i Centenary Banquet, Hotel Stevens, May 25, h6'i Temple, but there are two languages we all understand — the language of the spirit and that of music. We greet you in both and here, to make our greeting in music heard, is Walter Olitzki, baritone of the Metropolitan Opera Company and onc of our Baha guests at this Centenary. 

 Mr. Olitzki sings for you, as his first number, the beautiful Aria by Handel, ttWhere Etc You 'Walk,". — and it is a tribute in song to the revitalizing influence of the prophet when he walks the earth. 

 Thank you, Walter Olitzki, for that beautiful  interpretation. 

 Our next guest is a man who stands midway between north and south, our delegate from Panama, that vital link between North and South America. We thought it fitting that he should speak on this occasion for both the Americas, since, through his republic, flows the great spiritual stream of Baha'i spirit and brotherhood, from our shores to those of our Latin-Amer-ican  coworkers for the unity of all men. Mr. Alfred Osborne was educated at our own University of Chicago and is today supervisor  of schools in the Canal Zone. I am very happy to present to you, Mr. Alfred E. Osborne.

  I am one of a number of delegates from Latin-America and the 'vVest Indies. 

 Many of us are in the United States for the first time. Two of us have come from as far south as Brazil and Chile. 

 In spite of extreme difficulties due to the present war conditions, we all managed somehow to get transportation, for doors miraculously opened to permit us to be present at the All-America 

Baha'i Centenary.          

 I am sure that the other delegates from Central and South America feel the way I do. I wish it had been possible for all the believers in our countries and all the believers in the United States, in fact, all those people who have never even heard of the Baha'i Faith to have been present during this Cen

  International group of Baha'is attending the Centenary Celebrations in Wilmette, May, 1944. 

  tenary Celebration and to have seen for themselves that a pattern of life based on unity and fellowship has actually been set up and is being practiced today by hundreds and thousands of believers throughout the world, representing various backgrounds in race, religion, nationality and culture. 

 We all have desired a new world in which love and justice, peace and harmony, shall prevail. There is not a single person who has not prayed and longed for the Kingdom of heaven on earth, Still we do know that the old barriers of prejudice, of race, class and creed, separate the members of the human family. The sad fact is this: that although  our material civilization has brought us closer together, has reduced or removed the physical barriers of distance and place, yet the peoples of the earth have not yet learned to cooperate with one another and live in peace and harmony. 

 To witness, therefore, some of the events of the Centenary  observance which indicate that human nature can certainly change, that new social values can be deliberately created; that in fact, the new world is already in existence in the worldwide Baha'i family, should be tidings of great joy and hope to a world weighed down with grave social problems and faced with serious postwar adjustments. In the Baha'i Teachings we read this state — ment: "Today the world of humanity is walking in darkness because it is out of touch with the world of God." For the past week I have been living in the world of God. 

     In the Baha'i Temple I     

 saw the people of various racial, religious and cultural backgrounds  assembled to worship God and to celebrate the one hundredth Anniversary of God's new Revelation to mankind. But more than that, I saw these people actively demonstrate  the cardinal principle of the Baha'i Faith ~tthav religion is man's attitude toward God reflected in his attitude towards his fdllowman." 

 For here, under the dome of the Baha'i Temple, all are equal not only in the eyes of God but also in the eyes of one another. 

 In the Baha'i House of Worship there is no difference of race, no difference of color, no difference of creed, no difference of class. 

  There in Foundation Hall   

 during the Convention sessions the highest type of democracy  was in evidence. 

 Every delegate, regardless of his education, social status, color or nationality, had the right and the privilege  of contributing to the deliberations of the Convention. And each contribution was given consideration regardless of its source. Here was an assembly composed of delegates not motivated by sectional interests, not seeking the favors of their constituents, not


<p176>
176              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  previously instructed as to their voting, their attitudes or their decisions; not concerned with their own locality; but delegates working  for the welfare of the whole world community; interested as much in the problems of Brazil as those of the United States, of Jamaica as those of Canada; willing to alter pre-concervcd ideas in the light of consultation  and majority thinking; and voting oniy for those un-nominated individuals whom they felt possessed those intellectual, moral and spiritual qualities requisite for service on the Baha 

National Spiritual Assembly.

 I was thrilled to see the spirit of true fe11owshi~ lived and practiced during every moment of the Centenary. 

 Even around the dining tables under the huge tent was man attitude toward God reflected in his attitude toward his fellow man." Here were various groups speaking various languages but even between those with whom there was no communication through the spoken word, there was complete understanding though the language of the heart. One of the Latin-American  delegates expressed this truth nicely when he facetiously reminded us of Bernard Shaw's expression "that the United States and England were separated by the same language," but the North and South American countries represented at the Baha'i Centenary were united in spite of different languages. 

 In different localities of the world where religious and racial prejudices have been such strong barriers that it has been absolutely  impossible for people to meet together in the spirit of understanding and fellowship, today under the banner of the 

Baha'i Faith the Muhammadan

 and Jew; the Buddhist and the Christian; the Occidental and the Oriental; the Black and the White, the rich and the poor all find their differences dissolved in the penetrating light of Baha'u'llah's message for this age. This Teaching creates the consciousness of the oneness of the world and proves that we are all members of the same human family, despite superficial differences in color and physiognomy. 

 In the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Son of the Founder of the Baha'i Faith, "The lovers of mankind, these are the superior man, of whatever nation, creed, or color they may be.... 

 God is no respecter of persons on account of either color or race. 

 Inasmuch as all were created in the image of God, we must bring ourselves to realize that all embody divine possibilities." 

 This Teaching creates the consciousness of the essential unity of all revealed religion and shows that the Prophets are one in spirit, one in purpose and one in the source of their power. 

 According to this marvelous teaching  each Prophet fulfills the promise given by his predecessor, enlarges the scope of truth and gives assurance that another Prophet will come at the end of the era. 

 One picture that stands out vividly in my mind is the enthusiastic photographing on the Temple grounds of the believers, representing various racial backgrounds. 

 In these photographs were the believers from Iran, France, Central and South America, China, Canada, Cuba, Hawaii, Alaska, Jamaica, Mexico and the United States. 

 Surely this was eloquent evidence of the unity in diversity  which is one of the cardinal principles of the Baha'i Faith. 

 These thousands of believers in the Cause of Baha'u'llah, gathered together from all parts of the world, were able to conquer physical distance through the marvelous means of transportation available today. They came to the Centenary not as strangers from distant lands but as members of one loving, all-embracing Baha'i family. And that is what it means to be a Baha. 

 To be a Baha'i is to find in every distant land a home, in every stranger a friend, in every fellow human being, a true brother. 

 For the Baha'i is already a citizen of the world. 

 He believes and practices the admonition of Baha'u'llah, who has written: "The world is but one country and mankind its citizens." 

 ccy are all leaves of one tree and the fruits of one branch." 

 "Let not a man glory in this that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this that he loves his kind." 

  Mr. Windust speaks: I think we have all felt this week as Mr. Osborne has stated, that we have experienced a preview, as it were, of the new world that we shall all live in some day, and which is


<p177>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 177

  today already a very tangible world populated  by the Baha'is around the globe. 

 Pd like to introduce to you now some other citizens of this new Baha'i world, citizens from its far-flung ramparts, and representing its varied races. 

 First, from the nerve-center of our own North America, I'd' like to introduce Miss Elsie Austin, an attractive young attorney from Washington, D. C. Miss Austin was the first Negro woman to be appointed assistant attorney general of Ohio. 

 She is now in Washington with the federal government and is connected with many national educational groups. Miss Austin.

Miss ELSIE AUSTIN          

  The BabS'i Centenary has had a profound effect upon all of us. It is something to see people who represent every traditional separation  come together and practice a belief. 

 It convinces one that the Baha'i faith is that force which is powerful enough to make men turn from old resentments and entrenched  aversions to establish together needed social patterns for new spiritual and material achievements. 

  Mr. Windust speaks: Now we swing down into South America, to hear from Seijor Eduardo Gonzales L6pez, our delegate from Guayaquil, Ecuador. Sefior L6pez is a graduate of Ecuador College. He has been broadcasting for the past nine months on the Quito radio. He is attending the Baha'i Centenary and came to this country for that purpose just a few days ago. He will speak in Spanish and it will be translated.

  EDUARDO GONZALES L6PEZ     

  I should like to tell you, friend of the Americas, that which we witnessed in Wil-mette,  Illinois, in the United States, during the past week, was not just a spectacle of a large group of people coming together from all over the western hemisphere — not simply a convention — not just the celebration of the Baha'i centenary — it was much more. What we witnessed during that centenary celebration was the fruit, the first harvest, of the seed sown by 'Abdu'l-Baha in North America. This seed was cultivated by the North American Baha'is, and then borne by the spiritual wind to the South American continent. 

 This seed was sown on good soil and is now bearing fruit. It can be clearly seen that because of the meeting at this centenary  celebration of the two Americas in real brotherhood and fellowship, that the seed was not sown in vain. 

     The North American Baha'is 

 are fortunate  indeed in being the means by which this work has been accomplished — and the means by which the southern hemisphere will become  illuminated. 

 To the North American Baha'is, therefore, is the glory of the first harvest, but in the future it will be for all the Americas, both North and South, and all will be joined in the fulfillment of that prophetic utterance of 'Abdu'l-Baha, son of the founder of the Baha'i Faith, that "the standard of peace and brotherhood will be raised in the 

Americas."                 

  Mr. Windust speaks: Again from South America, and deep in that continent, we bring you our delegate from Baha, Brazil, who is Dr. Fernando Nova. In addition to his private practice, Dr. Nova is the city physician of Baha. He has just arrived in this country to attend the Baha'i convention and will remain here for three months for medical research. 
Dr. Nova.

DR. FERNANDO NOVA          

  I think this Baha'i Convention has been a powerful spectacle. 

 I wish many people could have had the opportunity to see what it has been my privilege to see. 

 They would surely be attracted to these teachings. I have seen a demonstration of faith which has been an inspiration, and which will be an inspiration to the people of Brazil when they hear about it. It will bring more clearly an understanding of brotherhood and peace to the people of Brazil. I have just arrived from Baha, Brazil, and yet because of the friendliness and fellowship of the people at the convention, I feel a nearness, a closeness

  to the North Americans. 

 I intend to remain  among you for about three months and I hope to become better acquainted with you. 

 Ordinarily it takes several weeks to get into this country because of all the necessary government regulations, but by the grace of God the way was opened up to me and I came in three days and was able to witness this great demonstration of brotherhood on the shores of Lake 

Michigan in North America. 

 Greetings to all the North Americans from a South American brother. 

  Mr. W/indust speaks: Here with us, too, is a young man who is not a delegate but a guest at our celebration. From faraway Tihr~n, in fdn, nine of these Persian youths, all Baha'is, recently came to America to study in our colleges. Eight of them have been with us this past week, and I want you to meet now, 

Firi~z Kazem-Zad~. Although

 only nineteen, Firiiz is a fourth-generation Baha'i and comes from the land where the Baha'i revelation was first proclaimed. 
I want you to meet Firxz

  I have visited many countries of Europe and Asia, and in all those countries I have been among the Baha'is, and I saw a very definite difference between those Baha'i communities and the people who surrounded them. 

 The main difference was this — that the Baha'i community was entirely free of the prejudices that existed all around it. They brought together all nation&, races, and classes of people. They established a pattern of the New World Order, the only pattern which can work, and which I saw in action in this most glorious convention. 

 I saw all these delegates gathered from so many places, working in perfect unity as the parts of one organism; the administrative organism which is destined to change the face of the Americas and in the years to come, of the world. 

 Radio broadcast ended with Dr. Nova's interview because of termination of the halfhour radio time.

  Mr. W/indnst speaks: From another faraway land, we have had as our guest, Miss Hilda Yen, of Chungking, China. 

 Miss Yen represented China at the League of Nations in 1935 and 1937. 

 She is an aviatrix, and, after her experience in the battle of Hongkong and her escape to Free China, she flew to this country to lecture  on how to win universal peace. She is a brand new Baha'i and I am sure we would all like to hear her impressions of this Centenary celebration. Miss Yen. 
                           
INTERVIEW OF               
                           
Miss HILDA YEN             

  Five years ago I was in the United States travelling and lecturing on China, on world federal government and on world peace. I was at that time flying the plane "The Spirit of New China," and on one of my trips I crashed. Upbn recovering from this accident I had a realization that the first life I had lived (before the accident) had been for China. But what I think of now as my second life I dedicated to the service of God and of all mankind. Since then I have been in China again and was in the battle of Hong Kong. I escaped from there to "Free China," and flew over to this country last year. 

 Since coming to your country again I have found a faith, a religion in action, that will bring into reality the oneness of mankind and all the good things men are entitled  to. I have found, at last, a group of sincere people who actually practice what they preach and do not just pay lip service to the brotherhood of man. 

 I find that I agree with all of their teachings and have just recently embraced this faith.

                PERSIA CELEBRATES THE
                 FIRST HUNDRED YEARS

  IT WAS a May evening in Shir~z. Through the dusk, by two's and three's, at intervals, men were coming; unobtrusively, they went through the door of a house and joined the throng of persons inside. They were silent, too moved for speech; they had come here from all over Persia, in secret, at the risk, perhaps, of their lives (in a short time, some of their fellows were to be killed by mobs in Persian streets). 

 They had come here to share in the joy of this night. 

 One hundred years ago, less half an hour, in an upper room of the House next door, the youthful Mb had declared His mission. Then, only two persons on the planet knew of His Faith. 

Tonight its Centenary      

 was being celebrated around the globe. 

 Voices that had been raised in prayer were stilled. 

 And now the men, who included  90 Convention delegates and the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, poured rose water on their hands. Silently, they took off their shoes and stepped into the courtyard of the sacred House next door. 

 They circumambulated the House; through the shadows, they heard the chanting  of the Visitation Tablet, that begins, "The praise which hath dawned from Thy most august Self rest upon Thee. 

 They performed the pilgrimage rites set forth in the 

Tablet of Pilgrimage       

 (Lawb-i-Uaii).  Then they climbed the stairway to the Threshold of the Room where, one hundred years ago tonight, the Bib's disclosure  had been received by His first disciple;  where a message destined for the whole human race had blazed out before one man, leaving him dazzled and as if he had lost his mind. Here in the 

Declaration Chamber, Jinib-i-Varqi

 had spread out a precious carpet, the Guardian's gift. 

 At the exact moment when the hundred


<p182>
182              THE I3AHA'1 WORLD

  The room in Shir4z in which the Bab declared His Mission in 1844, on May 22; on the evening of this same day, one hundred years later, the Delegates to the Annual Baha Convention, with Other Believers, visited this Sacred and Historic Spot. 

  years were completed — that is, at two hours and eleven minutes after sunset — the members  of the National Spiritual Assembly on behalf of the Guardian, and all the delegates,  one after the other, knelt down and kissed the Threshold. 

 Then a portion of the Guardian's new letter, beginning, ccGreeting and glory rest upon I-us Herald, the Peerless One," and (tO Holy night, upon thee of all praises be the best and most glorious!" 

 was chanted, and afterward, very humbly and prayerfully, and bowing low, the men took leave of the sacred House, returned next door, and till dawn they listened to the chanting of prayers, the recitation  of Baha'i odes, and readings from Baha'i history and from the new Centenary letter of the Guardian. Then as it grew light they went away, by two's and three's, to their appointed homes. 

 The Baha'i Centenary celebrations of Persia were set in motion by a detailed letter


<p183>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 183

  from the Guardian, dated Qudrat 18, year 100, to the National Spiritual Assembly. The NSA, however, did not at the time risk the distribution of this letter. Everywhere, the annual election of Convention delegates was held as usual, and the list of delegates reported to the National Spiritual Assembly. Only then did each delegate receive confidential  instructions from the National body, telling him to proceed to Shir~z on the appointed  date, and to keep his destination a secret even from his immediate family. For it was thoroughly understood that any rumor of the projected celebrations at ShirAz might prevent their being held at all. 

 This excerpt from the Guardian's instructions was included with the communication to the delegates: That the lunar date of the Declaration was no longer to be observed,  but the solar; that is, the evening of May 22 (which in the year 60 fell on the evening preceding the 5th of JamAdiyu'1 —  Avval and tip to now had been so observed in the East; the lunar year, as is known, contains only 354 days, and in the course of a few years differs considerably from the solar). That the festivals should continue for one full week, and coincide with the National Convention. 

 That the delegates were to meet in the holy city of Thir~z, to be vigilant and cautious, and to gather in all humility at the sacred Threshold, observing  the pilgrimage procedure and commemorating the exact moment of the Declaration. 

 The Guardian likewise directed that they should read the first siirih of the Qayy6m-1-Asm6.', revealed by the Bab in the presence of Mull4 ~usayn on that long ago night. 

 That every member of the National  Assembly should be present on his behalf, as this would rejoice his heart. That although the convening of such a gathering at the sacred House seemed most duff cult at the time, nevertheless it was an essential obligation. 

 That no newspaper notices or telegraphic communications referring to the event should be permitted. 

 That if the Convention could not meet in ShirAz a neighboring  spot should be designated but that the presence of the delegates at the sacred House on the Declaration evening was an absolute necessity. 

 That all participants should behave  in such a way as not to excite the suspicions of the authorities or the violence of the masses — for otherwise the enemies of the Faith would initiate plots and disturbances and frustrate this purpose. 

 The Guardian's directions stressed the heavy responsibility of the National Spiritual Assembly and the exalted character of the Festival, and warned the friends repeatedly  of the danger, and of the need for courage and caution. 

 And so Persia celebrated the birth of the new Faith. 

 The weeklong festival was proclaimed  all over the country, to Central Assemblies, Local Assemblies, groups, and isolated believers. 

 Not a man, woman or child was left out. Everywhere the new date, the evening of May 22, went into effect, for this is "the inception of the Badi' calendar, and the opening of the first century of the Baha'i era, and the commencement of the manifestation of the Promised One of all sacred Scripture, and the Birth of the Center of the Covenant of the 

AbhA Beauty, His Holiness  
'Abdu'1 —  Baha." The Baha'i 

 date of the Centenary celebration was: the day of '1dM, the day of Kalimit, of the month of 'Azamat, of the year V~v, of the 6th VThid, of the first Kull-i-Shay'. 

 Paradoxically, while the Baha'is of Persia lack printed books — the publication of Baha'i books being forbidden by the Persian Government — and the Baha'is of the West are rich in these, nevertheless the Persian Baha'is are, for language reasons, momentarily  the sole possessors of wonderful texts such as the Odes of Baha'u'llah, and writings of the Guardian such as the Centenary account made especially for them, and other treasured material which, when time permits, will be available around the world. Again, while the Baha'is of other countries read the Teachings in one language, the Persian iBah4'is must read in two — Persian and Arabic. 

 Where abstruse texts such as the writings of the Bib are concerned average  communities must enlist the aid of Persian Baha'i scholars, of which fortunately  there are many. We find, for example, that in the town of Khurram-Shahr the noted teacher Tar~zu'L1ih Sarnandari postponed his departure to assist the friends there in rehearsing the difficult texts.


<p184>
184             THE BAHA'I WORLD

 CCTO plunge in the sea of Divine utterance and make the soui ascend to the worlds of the spirit," the NSA had written the Baha'is of Persia, was the purpose of their 

Centenary Festival. The    

 reality, not the outer form, of their gatherings, was what counted. When, for example, it proved unwise to convene  one large gathering in some locality, several meetings were held there simultaneously. 

 Everything was conducted quietly and with dignity; no telegrams or greeting-cards were exchanged; during the Centenary period, work was as usual abstained from on two days, that of the Declaration of the BTh, and the Ascension of Baha'u'llah, on which latter day the festivals were discontinued  and befitting commemorations held. 

 Only competent and carefully-rehearsed readers and singers were used on the programs;  in laying down this requirement as to perfection of delivery, the NSA had explained, "for this increases joy and spirituality,  whereas the lack of it causes in the hearer weariness and dejection." The NSA likewise directed that two days in the series were to be given over to and managed by the Baha'i Youth. 

 A mimeographed program of impressive size (36 pages) was sent out by the National Spiritual Assembly all over Persia. 

 This contained  some of the actual texts to be used during the celebrations. 

 They included: nine prayers of the B&b; excerpts from the Bib's Tablet to Muhammad ShAh, revealed at MThii; the first chapter of the BTh's Commentary on the S&ih of Joseph 

(Qayyiimu'1-AsmA')  ;      

 excerpts from the Persian Bay~n; two Tablets of Baha'u'llah on the Declaration of the BTh; the Tablet Ay tiitiyAn-i-Hind-i-jin; the Tablet "0 nightingales of God"; Odes of Baha'u'llah; The Master's Tablet directing that only the Declaration of the Mb, nor His own Birth, be celebrated;  excerpts from the Guardian's Dispensation of Baha'u'llah and from 

The Unfoldment  of World  

 Civilization, both translated into Persian (respectively on the station  of the Bib, and the unity of the human race); Nabil's account of the Declaration; the song AbhA'iyin bishArat. 

 In addition to these texts the programs featured others, including the prayers of the Guardian, the Tablet of Carmel, poems by Baha'i poets, and appropriate speeches. 

 For a closeup of many hundreds of gatherings held that week in Persia, here are a few typical details from reports sent in to the NSA by Central Assemblies all over the country: In Shiriz, two women and ten men planned the Festival. 

 Fearing that the Baha'is might be attacked should they meet in one place — that their concerts, chants and general air of rejoicing would cause an outcry — they arranged for the friends to meet simultaneously in large private homes throughout the city. In crowded sections, so as not to arouse attention, group singing and concerts were replaced by violin and vocal soios. Children, youth and adults participated in the programs, and in spite of the great Baha'i crowds, there was no trouble from the public. The pilgrimage to the sacred House, described above, was fol —  lowed by the annual Convention, which met from 'Azamat 6 to 15 and elected these men to the National Spiritual 

Assembly:

 Afnin, and his wife were especially active in contributing  to the success of the celebrations. Hosts in the selected homes defrayed all expenses involved. A final reception, attended  oniy by the Local Spiritual Assembly, its committee members and their wives, and the Convention delegates, and given by Fadlu'llAh Hakim-J~n, numbered more than 300 guests. 

 In Rasht the children, pupils of the f a-mous character-building classes, played a prominent role. 

 A little girl of five, Rawshan RAfat, pupil of the first class in character-building, recited a poem; a seven year old boy, Muhammad-Rich KhAvari addressed the large gathering on The Behavior of the Baha'i Child; a boy of eight, R~ihu'11Ah Nabili, spoke on The Abandonment of Prejudice and Fanaticism; a boy of nine, Shams-i-Din Fad&'i, spoke on the Declara-don of the Bab; another child described the death of H~ji SulaymAn KhAn another

  spoke on Abstaining from 

BackBiting and Slander.   

 The tiny members of the first and second CMracter-Building classes, wearing a special uniform, sang a chant of the Guardian's. 

 The youth of Rasht were hosts on two nights, arranging every detail of the program themselves. Some took part in the program, some greeted the guests, others were ushers, others served the refreshments. They had set up the speakers' table between two large drawing-rooms, and had been lavish  with flowers, costly furnishings, artistic Light-effects. 

 They chanted prayers and Tablets, served fruits, sweets, salted nuts, tea; had a girls' choir, a violin recital, and the radio. They sang Baha'i songs to specially written music (not the popular tunes sometimes  adopted). 

 The girls were active contributors;  a girl speaker, Mu'aziz SamadAni, spoke on the deeds of Baha'i youth, in particular MullA Ijusayn, from the dawn of Baha'i history. 

 At an adult meeting, a woman speaker T6M KMnum SamadAni, was much applauded for her address on noted Baha'i women. 

 Women were also prominent in 'Tdq. (The point is stressed because, up to nine years prior to the Centenary, the women of Persia still wore the veil.) Here Kh4num Nim-T~ij and KMnum QA'im-Maq~mi entertained  at their homes and KMnum JhtisMm-ZAdih at the local Haziratu'1-Quds. 

 On the night of Baha'u'llah's Ascension  the friends met at the lidme of RiThan-giz KhThum MuhAjirin, remaining in prayer until 4:30 in the morning. Here as elsewhere,  the friends rejoiced that there was no trouble from the public. 

 In Burdjird, however, an Assembly member  met with difficulties which seemed to presage trouble for the Faith; for caution's sake, the celebrations were temporarily discontinued on the second night, but were resumed as the rumors against Baha'i activities  subsided. 

 DuriTh included in its celebrations a daylong picnic, and the recitation of the poems of TAhirili, 

Varqi, and Centenary       
verses by Aq&y-i-Nik-Jii.  

 Khurram-Shahr could meet oniy at night, because of the intense heat. In Shahmirz~d and Damghin, the public was reported surprised and impressed by the Festival; in contrast to the past, when they rose up and protested against every meeting of Baha'is, they now began to investigate the Faith. In AMdAn, where the friends are chiefly day laborers and small wage-earners, they gathered hightly in two meeting places, and eighteen of the believers financed the celebrations. NonBahA'is were invited to be present, and the public began to appreciate  the greatness of the Faith and the unity of the believers. 

 Sangsar presented a breakfast and Luncheon on the Declaration Day to a large number of the friends, and children from the Character-Building classes put on an educational play. Community leaders, municipal and government authorities,  leading merchants, were much impressed  by these activities; a special day was arranged for them, on which they heard talks on the Centenary, attended a play given by the children and expressed their appreciation. 

 In a Persian garden hung with electric lights, its avenues carpeted with precious rugs, the Baha'is of HamadAn celebrated as guests of BahA'-i-Din 'Ali-Zidih. The speakers' platform was decorated with sacred portraits; over the gathering was hung the Greatest Name, and directly below it a large, electrically-lit sign in which was cut this verse: "Awake for H~shidar hath now revealed His Cause; Jerusalem and Mecca are bowing toward Shiriz." The guests, some of whom were Muslims, were welcomed with rose-water and other perfumes. With many watching from neighboring rooftops, the Festival opened at the exact moment when the hundred years reached its end, when the large audience rose and listened with deep emotion as the recorded voice of the Master filled the garden. 

 On succeeding days other believers opened their homes to the crowds of celebrants. The sixth of these festivals, on 'Azamat 11, was held at the home of M1isi Khayy~m, where courtyard and balcony were decorated with Portraits and lights, with rugs and silken drapes; among the guests on this occasion were three high-ranking American officers, who had expressed interest in the Festival; they were accompanied by two interpreters,  one of whom was a Baha'i.

  program was translated for them, and they were given two copies in English of a Tablet (the LAhAy). 

 Another of the meetings, at the home of Habibu'11Th IttiMdi-yyih,  was attended by Jewish, Christian and Muslim guests, and on this occasion, too, neighbors watched from the rooftops. 

 The ninth meeting, put on by the youth, was especially effective because it was held at the Haziratu'1-Quds, where for some time owing to local disturbances the friends had not been able to meet. The believers were so pleased with the decorations used by the youth that five persons purchased some of these, such as the branched lighting-fix-tures and the portrait frames of inlaid work, for the permanent use of the building. The Baha'i library of Sadr-i-Sudiir was officially opened and dedicated on this occasion. 

  The weeklong Festival    

 made a great impact  on the public all over Persia, inspired the friends and brought them close to their fellows in seventy-seven other countries of the globe. Cables and other communications added to their joy; these came from the Guardian of the Faith, and from 'Ir~q, the United States and Canada, India, Egypt and the Sudan, Australia and New Zealand, Bahrayn, a group of Persian students in the United States; later an a letter from 

Fir6z KAzim-Z~dih, Baha'i 

 Persian student at Stanford University, describing the Centenary  Celebrations which he attended at Wil-mette,  also arrived and was officially circulated. 

 Prior to the Festival, the Baha'is of India obtained permission from their Government  for fifty Persian Baha'is to be present at their Centenary; the fifty were selected, and prepared to leave, but unfortunately  their visas arrived too late for them to make the journey. 

 In brilliant drawing-rooms and auditoriums,  in cool gardens, with lights and flowers, tapestries and handwoven rugs, with songs, chants, addresses, recitations from Baha'i history, with fragrant tea in wasp-waisted glasses, candies, saffron-colored rice dishes —  the great holiday crowds of Baha'is throughout  Persia celebrated the first hundred years of their Faith.

  It was a memorable spring. It meant that whole planet opening to their message. And their religion, once driven out of Persia and so, welcoming one another, they poured out almost obliterated, had won the victory. The rose-water in the Persiap way; a few months Baha'is could see now that they had no way later, some were as generously to pour out to go but forward; they could see the their blood. 

           BAHA'I CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS
                IN THE BRITISH ISLES

  THE Guardian of the Faith sent a cable to the British Convention of 1943, urging deliberation upon ttprompt effectual meas ures    befitting celebration 

May 1944                  
Centenary Faith. Advise   

 prepare outstanding  events forty-five year history 

Faith British  Isles."   

 The second task was the more straightforward. 

 A committee comprising Mr. Baha'i,  Mary Basil Hall, Miss Pinchon and Mrs. Slade, worked throughout the year and produced a small book entitled c~The Centenary  of a 'World Faith." The war time publishing difficulties were all surmounted, and the task done. 

 Planning and carrying out a befitting celebration of the Centenary was a much more complicated matter, involving constant consultation, trial and adjustment to what was possible in war time. 

 The result was a magnificent success, and the Guardian himself said it was the outstanding event of the Faith in these islands since the Master's presence here in 191213. The major occasions  were in the capital, but celebrations were held by local Baha'i communities as well. In addition to corresponding members from Bournemouth, Bradford, Manchester and Torquay, the committee responsible for the celebrations was composed of Mr. St. Barbe Baker, David Hofman, Mrs. Hyett, Miss Isenthal, Mrs. Stevens. The brunt of the work inevitably fell on the London members, and all the friends there worked hard and enthusiastically. 

 For some months prior to the Centenary date, a publicity agent, engaged by the N.S.A., had been at work, and occasional references to the Faith were seen in newspapers and magazines. As the spring of 1944 unfolded, posters, strictly conforming in size and number to war time regulations, appeared in and about London. 

 The centenary  was listed as one of the coming public functions. 

 It was important to have some person of eminence to open the celebrations, and we were very happy indeed when Sir Ronald Storrs consented to do so. His qualifications for such a duty are outstanding (he mentions  them in his introductory remarks), and the Guardian requested that his appreciation of Sir Ronald's ~~nobIe courageous act," should be conveyed to him. 

 The main feature of the week's celebrations  was an exhibition, open every day, and the scene of some interesting evening functions.  In addition a public meeting was held at Denison House, and the regular occasions of the annual Convention took place at the Baha'i 

Centre.                   

 The exhibition was housed in Alliance Hall, at the very heart of 'Westminster. 

 Five minutes walking would have brought one to the Houses of Parliament, 'Whitehall, or in another direction, Buckingham Palace. The Hall was long and well proportioned; panelled in oak and well lit. A raised dais at one end formed a platform for speakers. Behind it was a large map of the world. From many points coloured streamers radiated  to side panels, on which were pinned the telegrams and messages from Baha'i centres around the globe. There was a large display of Baha'i literature, one interesting exhibit being copies of Dr. Esslemont's book

 ceBah~~u~1Uh and the New Era" in thirty-three  languages. 

 Sayings of Baha'u'llah on human unity and world peace, were presented  side by side with the most up to date statements by the world's leaders. 

 The lower end of the hail was occupied by exhibits personal to the Founders of the Faith. 

 A robe worn by Baha'u'llah; a robe of 'Abdu'l-Baha's; a ring presented by Him to Lord Lamington and by Lady Lamington to the Baha'i community. 

 There were large photographs of the Master;  an original and beautiful specimen of the work of the famed calligraphist Mishkin; photographs of the 

Temple; of Dr. Essle-mont;    

 of occasions during the Master's visits to England. 

 Many people visited the exhibition, and a great deal of literature was taken away. The main items were packed and sent to other centres for use in local exhibitions.

  B~ Sm. RONALD STORKS, K.C.M.G., LL.D., L.C.C. THE following are extracts from the speech made by Sir Ronald Storrs, who opened the Baha'i Centenary Exhibition at the Alliance Hall, Palmer Street, 'Westminster, London, SW. 1, on Saturday afternoon,  May 20: cdt is a high honour for an Anglican Englishman to have been chosen to open the Centenary of a World Faith," said Sir Ronald,  and claimed three qualifications: "I am an M.A. of the same university, Cambridge, and a scholar of the same college, Pembroke, as Edward Browne, who was not only the finest Persian scholar of the age but the best-loved foreigner in Iran and throughout the Baha'i world; secondly, because I had the honour of Abbas Effendi's friendship from 1909 until his death; thirdly, I am the latest from that Front — of Haifa, 'Akka, Bazhd&d, Tihr~n, Isphahan and ShirAz."

  Sir Ronald Storrs opening the Baha'i Centenary Exhibition in London, Alliance Hall, Westminster, May 20th, 1944. 

  then went on to tell dramatically and poignantly  the story of the Bab, the centenary of whose declaration was being celebrated. CCWhy is 1944 the Centenary of this Faith? Because 100 years ago, all but two days, a young merchant of ShirAz, Sayyid 'Au-Muhammad, not yet 25 years old, declared to one follower that he was the bearer of a new message to mankind. 

 He described himself as the Bib, meaning gate, or door, of this dispensation. 

 His followers soon multiplied, but lie spent most of his life in captivity, until in 1 8 50 he was condemned, like Christ, Socrates and other religious innovators,  to death. 

 His execution was marked by a startling portent, which is thus recorded in a contemporary Persian tTll' 

Narrative':               

 "An iron nail was hammered into the middle of the staircase of the very ccli wherein they were imprisoned, and two ropes were hung down. By one rope the Mb was suspended and by the other rope Ak~ Mu-harnmad-'Ali, both being firmly bound in such wise that the head of that young man was on the Mb's breast. The surrounding housetops billowed with teeming crowds. A regiment of soldiers ranged itself in three files. The first file fired; then the second file, and then the third file discharged voi-leys.  From the fire of these volleys a mighty smoke was produced. When the smoke cleared away they saw that young man standing and the Mb seated by the side of his amanuensis, Ak~ Sayyid Husayn, in the very cell from the staircase of which they had suspended them. The bullets had merely cut the ropes. 

 To neither one of them had the slightest injury resulted. 

 ttAkA J4n Beg, of Khamsa, colonel of the bodyguard advanced; and they again bound the Rib together with that young man to the same nail. The Mb uttered certain words which those few who knew Persian under

  stood, while the rest heard but the sound of his voice. The colonel of the regiment appeared in person. Suddenly he gave orders to fire. At this volley the bullets produced such an effect that the breasts of the victims were riddled, and their limbs, but not their faces, which were but little marred." 

 Speaking of his personal experiences and contact with 'Abdu'l-Baha, Sir Ronald said: "My first connection with the Baha'i Faith dates from the beginning of this century,  when it was my fortune and honour to become the Arabic pupil of Edward Browne. 

 C!MY first glimpse of Abbas Effendi was in the summer of 1909, when I drove round the Bay of Acre in an Arab cab, visited him in the barracks and marvelled at his serenity and cheerfulness after 42 years of exile and imprisonment. I kept touch with him through my confidential agent, Husain Bey Ruhi, son of a Tabriz martyr, and the tPersian Mystic' of my book !OT lent ations' 

     "After the Young Turk      
Revolution, Abbas Effendi  

 was released. He visited Egypt in 1913, when I had the honour of looking after him, and of presenting him to Lord Kitchener, who was deeply impressed by his personality — as who could fail to be? Then war cut him off from us and it might have gone hard with him in Haifa but for the indirect  interposition of His Majesty's Government. 

 ttWhen, in his famous victory drive to the North, Allenby captured Haifa, he detached me from Jerusalem to organise the British Administration there. On the evening of my arrival I visited my revered friend. I found him sitting in spotless white. He placed at my disposal the training and talents of his community, and I appointed one or two to positions of trust, which they still continue to deserve. Later, he visited me in Jerusalem,  and was held in great esteem and respect by the High Commissioner, Lord Samuel. 

 In Egypt he presented me with a

 "Telegrams reached Haifa  
from all over the world.  

 Mr. Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, desired the High Commissioner for Palestine to convey  to the Baha'i Community on behalf of His Majesty's Government their sympathy and condolence on the death of Sir 'Abdu'l-Baha  'Abbas, K.B.E., and Field Marshal Lord Allenby telegraphed likewise from Egypt.

Recently I had the honour of receiving at the British Legation in TihrAn, a deputation of the Baha'i Community, headed by Samimi, the respected Chief Munshi of the Legation, and Varga, President of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia. 

 Later I was received by the Council at a tea, so sumptuous that the remembrance adds a sting to my British Ration Card. My diary of April 5, 1943, at Shir~z, tells me: tAfter luncheon, off to visit the House of the Bib, leaving the car for the narrow winding streets, and shown over by Faziullali Benana and the curator. A small but perfect courtyard, with a little blue tiled, eight feet square tank, six large red goldfish, a tiny orange tree and runner carpets round the sides, and a narrow deep well. Above, His bed and His sitting rooms (for which our hosts took off their shoes), and on the second floor the room in which in 1844 He declared His mission, to a solitary disciple.'

 are Baha'is actively, honourably, peaceably employed. 

 'tMay this auspicious Centenary prove pro. pitiou~ also for the early restoration of world peace.~~ DENISON HOUSE, ROAD, LONDON, 

                   ON MAY 23, 1944

ON Tuesday, May 23 (May    

 23, 1844, being  the actual day on which the Bab declared His mission) a public meeting was held at Denison House, Vauxhall Bridge Road, London,  S.W.1. Mrs. Basil Hall, daughter of Lady Blomfield, with whom 'Abdu'l-Baha stayed when he visited London in 1912, was the chairman at this historic meeting, which she opened with these words: ttj the name of the Baha'is I bid you a very sincere welcome. We meet at a time when the revival of religion is needed. 

 Nearly all the physical means for uniting mankind already existing: transport, radio, international organisation, the project of the universal auxiliary language and the fact that nations are interdependent is accepted, oniy one thing is lacking: the will of the nations to unite, and that can only come by the power of the holy spirit, and it is by a new outpouring of this mighty power that we give you glad tidings today. Baha'u'llah proclaimed that religion is one and not many and that the truth of religion is progressively revealed to mankind through the ages by the manifestations of God — the purpose being


<p196>
196              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  to cQmbine men together in spirit and in social unity, and this can oniy come about by universal love and understanding of the search after truth through constructive discussion which will abolish all prejudice and superstition, because truth is one and no part of truth can counteract another, although there are as many aspects of truth as there are minds to perceive them. 

 ~CWe believe that rivalry among religions is the negation of religion itself and wholly alien to the divine purpose and hostile to the design of God. These false rivalries have arisen mainly through ignorance, but partly through lust for power and claims to the monopoly of grace and through intolerance with regard to superimposed doctrines. The inward truth of religion is one but the various  forms of worship express the differing natures of men. Variety is in harmony with nature. In a ucautiful garden you do not see only roses or lilies, you see many kinds of flowers and trees and that is what makes the garden beautiful. It is oniy the weeds of prejudice and superstition that must be rooted out. They cause contempt and hatred, and the oniy good and wholesome kind of rivalry there could be is a contest to remove these barriers and a race towards wider unities. There are many signs of this today and we rejoice in these signs. 

 The Baha'i faith is not merely one of many sects and many churches, it is the unifying force. Unity and not uniformity is our motto. Our faith is eminently reasonable and practical. There is nothing vague in the programme. To become a Baha'i you don't only not have to renounce your former faith, you must not renounce it. Your own religion becomes more real and profound when you realise its majestic continuity with all other faiths. The search after truth is one of our main principles. 

 No one is asked to believe anything  blindly. By your presence here today you have proved yourselves seekers after the truth. 

 It is difficult to grasp its magnitude at first, but we hope what you hear today will interest you profoundly. Now I am going to call on other speakers who will give you the tradition of this wonderful religion.~~ The other speakers at this meeting, which aimed at presenting an outline of the Baha'i Faith and the views of one or two eminent personalities who have contacted it on what the Baha'i teachings have to off?r the world, were: W. Tudor Pole, Shaw Desmond, 

Hannen Swaffer, Sir William

 Hornell, the Rev. Walter Winn, and Dr. Harold Moody. 

 The Baha'i speakers were: Hasan Baha'i, David Hofman, 

Norman Smith, an American  

 Baha'i over here with the United States Army and who was in London during the Centenary celebrations, and Miss Vivian Isenthal, who read some messages sent to the meeting. 

 Hasan Baha'i gave the following account of the life and mission of the Bib, which is reprinted in full since this day commemorated  the declaration of the Bib: "This week all over the world the Baha'is are celebrating the Centenary of the Declaration of the Bib. Who was the Bab and what were His claims? 

 Very briefly, the BTh was a young merchant who declared to a seeker after truth, on the eve of May 23, 1844, that He was the promised one awaited by the world of Islam and that He had come to herald the advent of a still mightier revelation.  He had only six years of ministry, of which four years were spent in prison, and in July, 1850, he was shot. That is the life of the Bab in very bare outline. 

 CCLCt us now see something more of Him in the different periods of His life. First of all, when He was a child, we have the testimony of His old tutor to the extraordinary powers that this child of seven possessed. This is not a matter of rumour or legend, there is the testimony of the man who was His tutor and who in later years followed and defended His cause. He was very bright, intelligent, kind and considerate, and one day this tutor despaired of having anything to impart to this very intelligent child and took Him to His uncle, who was His guardian, and told him that twith all my learning I have nothing to impart to this child.' 

 "Next we see Him on the evening of May 23, 1844. 

 A young man of 24, in search of the promised Deliverer, arrived at the gates of $hirAz, the famous city in South Persia, and was met by the BTh, who invited him to His house. 

 This invitation was given with such grace and courtesy that he could not

  but accePt it and there in His own house the Bab declared to this seeker that He was the one whom he was seeking. He produced proofs, and in the words of the speaker who said: ~ sat spellbound by His utterance, f or-getful  of time. I was blinded by the dazzling splendour of this revelation excitement, joy, awe and wonder stirred the depths of my soul the universe seemed but as a handful of dust in my grasp. 

 "At last the Bab arose, and in a voice that thrilled His amazed guest, declared: tThis night, this very hour, will in the days to come be celebrated as one of the greatest and most significant of all festivals. 

 Do thou render thanks to God for having graciously assisted thee to attain thine heart's desire, and for having quaffed from the sealed wine of His utterance. 

 Well is it with them that attain thereunto.' 

 "Seventeen others came of their own accord, met the BTh, accepted Him, and to them He gave the name of the Letters of the Living. They were the first ministers of His faith and He sent them out to teach and to spread the glad tidings. Here are a few extracts from the farewell address He gave theni: C~4~ beloved friends, you are the bearers of the name of God in this day You are witnesses of the Dawn of the promised Day of God Purge your hearts of worldly desires and let angelic virtues be your adorning.  The days when idle worship was deemed sufficient are ended. 

 The time is come when naught but the purest motive, supported by deeds of stainless purity can ascend unto the throne of the Most High Beseech the Lord, your God, that no earthly entanglements,  no wordly affections may tarnish the purity or embitter the sweetness of the grace that flows through you. 

 I am preparing you for the advent of a mighty 

Day                        

 Scatter throughout the length and breadth of this land, and with steadfast feet and sanctified hearts prepare the way for His coming.' 

 "They went out and practically all of them gave up their lives in the path of the new cause. 

 tcNext we see Him under arrest, confined to the house of His uncle, and then we see Him in prison in the mountains of North'West st Persia, under the charge of a very rough warden, noted for his brutality; but such was His charm that this same warden opened the prison doors to all visitors. 

 And so they took Him to the castle of Chihriq, and there again the warden of that castle, notorious for his rough methods, yielded to the charm of his prisoner. 

 "Finally, they decided to put an end to His life. 

 Persecution was raging all over the land; 10,000 suffered martyrdom. They brought Him to Tabriz, and with a faithful follower He was shot by 750 rifles, but when the smoke cleared, there was no sign of the Bib. 

 He was sitting in a chamber close by, finishing a conversation that had been rudely interrupted earlier in the day. He was led out again. The first regiment refused to fire again. A second regiment was called, and this time the Bab was killed. 

 Although the Bab was killed, although nearly all of His Letters of the Living had suffered martyrdom and 10,000 had died for this cause, and although it seemed that its enemies had succeeded  in extinguishing the Light of the Bab, neverthekss the cause lived. Now we will hear the rest of what happened." 

 Mr. David Hofrnan then gave an able presentation of the life and teachings of Baha'u'llah. "The reason why the cause of the Bab flourished," he said, ttwas that it came from God and could not be extinguished." 

 Speaking of the application of the teachings of Baha'u'llah to the needs of this day, he said: "The very first thing which Baha'u'llah says to mankind today is this: law and order must first be established, then civilization can follow. Baha'u'llah's plan for world reconstruction starts with the human being. 

 A firm foundation can only come thrAugh faith, through religion. Wherever the power of religion has failed in the past, society has decayed. Therefore Baha'u'llah shows mankind how to restore himself to a knowledge of why he is here, and where he is going." Mr. Hofman concluded his talk with these words: cdt is on the foundation of oneness that the Baha'i faith raises a structure of unity; a world parliament, to be elected by the nations of the world; a supreme tribunal; an international auxiliary language; a world economic system, functioning for the benefit of the whole human

  race: these are the outward signs of world order, the delineation of that Kingdom of God promised to mankind from the beginning of its history: 'The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens!' 

 It is on that spiritual truth that the Baha'i faith offers to mankind today a plan for world reconstruction." 

 The Rev. Walter Winn spoke next and said that he was surprised to have been invited  to take part in the iteeting as he was a nonconformist, with more than a tendency to spiritualism and that he had grave doubts about himself and therefore about the universe at large, "but on the other hand," he said, "I claim to be a devoted follower of Jesus Christ and I am here because I believe that my Master would tell me to come, and to say to you that the principles contained in your great and wonderful literature are the principles of Christianity. As I read the account of that most remarkable founder of yours, I said, my mind for sixty years has been traveling in this direction. I have read your books and there isn't a bit of difference between your conclusions and the actual teaching of Jesus Christ, and consequently we can all be one. There need be no division. There is nothing cranky about those books There is nothing cranky in the brain of that great man who founded this wonderful movement. Get on with it. Don't rely upon big temples and big buildings. 
Circulate  your ideas.   

 They will saturate and some morning they will become dynamite, and the sooner the better. 

 was preaching in a Yorkshire town one morning and again in the evening. After the morning service I took a walk and I heard some people singing ~tAII hail the power." I said that's me, so in I went. 
I sang 4ith sincerity.    

 I enjoyed the service, but after it there was a communion service, so I kept my seat. One of the deacons asked me to leave, because he had no evidence that I was one of the elect. 
I got up and walked out.  

 And I will take good care not to walk back. It is that division that is the curse of the world today. 

 You will not get rid of war, or the terrible inequalities of life until the divisions among religions are cured." 

 Mr. Winn recounted some amusing anecdotes  and brought laughter into a meeting which by its very nature was solemn. 'Abdu'l-Baha loved laughter and happiness, and this certainly seemed to draw the audience and the speakers closer together. 

 Mr. Tudor Pole's moving and intimate memoirs of 'Abdu'l-Baha followed, and are given here as fully as possible. He said: "I don't propose to tell you the story &f the life of 'Abdu'l-Baha, son of the founder of the Baha'i Faith, you can find his history set forth in the excellent books available at the Baha'i Centres. But as very few present have had the great privilege of meeting and talking  with tAbdu'1-Bah4 you may be interested in one or two reminiscences with regard to this wonderful teacher who did not wish to accept the title of tmaster' or tprophet' but who simply desired to be known as a servant of the Father. I remember in the spring of 1919, when the Great War that was to end all wars was over, visiting CAbd 'lB ii' at his home near Haifa, on the slopes of Mount Carmel, when I tried to congratulate him, in the belief that a final Armageddon had been fought and won, he told me that the war just ended had sown the seeds for a far greater struggle than anything that had yet happened in human history and that I should live to witness this catastrophic event. 'Abdu'l-Baha  added that so far as the material issues were concerned, aerial warfare would prove the decisive factor. You may imagine my consternation. 

 I reminded 'Abdu'l-Baha's of what he had said in Paris in March, 1913, which I will read to you: tDo you know in what Day you are living? Do you realize in what Dispensation you are alive? Have you not heard in the Holy Scriptures that at the consummation of the ages there shall appear a Day which is the Sun of all the past Days? This is the Day in which the Lord of Hosts has come down from heaven on the clouds of glory! This is the Day in which the inhabitants of all the world shall enter under the shelter of the Word of God. 

 This is the Day whose real sovereign is His 

Highness the Almighty.    

 This is the Day when the East and the West shall embrace  each other like unto two lovers. This is the Day in which war and contention shall be forgotten. This is the Day in which nations and governments will enter into an eternal bond of amity and conciliation.

  Century is the fulfilment of the Promised Century.' 

 ~ asked how he could reconcile this statement  with the reference to the coming of a still greater Armageddon than the Great War of 1914 to 1918. This was his reply: CNO word spoken by my father or by myself has been spoken in vain.' 

 It is clear, therefore, that this great seer foresaw not only the tribulations through which we are now passing, but also the coming of the Most Great Peace before the present century ends. Out of the darkness of our grave afflictions will be born the light of the new Day. This Day is even now approaching. 

 ~'Let me tell you the story that is well known but is worth repeating in regard to 'Abdu'l-Baha's presence at the time of the British attack upon Haifa in the summer of 1918. Some of us in Allenby's army were much alarmed by the information brought out of Haifa by our Intelligence agents, to the effect that the enemy intended to crucify 'Abdu'l-Baha and his family before evacuating  the city. 

 It transpired that the Baha'is in Haifa gathered round their great leader and many of them encamped in the gardens round his house. One of those present told me later that during this period of extreme tension 'Abdu'1-I3ahi used these words: ~A11 is well, the power of the spirit is with us. Not a single shell from the British guns will fall within the city, which will be taken undamaged  within 48 hours and its people. freed.' 

 As a matter of fact, owing to the incorrect sighting of the guns, the British shells were falling harmlessly into the bay, and the prophecy just referred to was fulfilled. 

 "I remember an occasion when 'Abdu'l-Baha  took me to see the 'Akka prison house where he and his father and the family had been confined for nearly 40 years, and how he spoke about the Lord's Prayer in these words: tRemember there is prophecy as well as petition in the great prayer which 

His Holiness the Christ    

 gave to the world. The prophecies in the Lord's Prayer will be hal-filled,  and perhaps more quickly than is realised; His kingdom shall come, His will shall be done on earth; daily bread shall be given to all; sins shall be forgiven and as each one turns to seek the kingdom that is within, so shall all good things be added to him.' 

 tLay the foundation of your affection,' said 'Abdu'l-Baha, C~i~ the very centre of your spiritual being, at the very heart of your consciousness, and let it not be shaken by adverse winds.' 

 cDo not expect to find peace without until you have attained that inward peace which is built on the rock of Faith, and so cannot be shaken by outer tribulations.' 

 cTbe Baha'i teaching does not ask a man to desert the Faith of his forefathers but to live it, in unity and fellowship with all men irrespective of their colour, caste or creed, for we are all leaves of one tree.' 

 ¶Ere long,' says Baha'u'llah, God will sail His Ark upon thee.' 

 "Have we each begun to prepare a harbour within, in order to receive the Ark of the Covenant of Peace, so that the New Day may be manifested through us?" 

 Shaw Desmond expressed his pleasure at being on a platform that was ttessentially international" and made a witty and eloquent  speech, of which there is, unfortunately, no available record. 

 Hannen Swaffer also made a characteristic speech, in which he recalled receiving a visit from Mrs. Hanford Ford, in whom he met a very gracious and charming lady who was obviously breathing the spirit of what I heard for the first time when I heard of the Baha'i Faith. 

 I have since read and found out a lot about your community and I know it to be one of those great movements which are destined to build the magnificent future out of the unhappy past. 

 ~cIt is time," he said, ttthat there was brought into being a great world movement to merge differences in religion and to share the building up of the future." 

 Mr. Swaffer recounted picturesquely the story of the gods who, as a jest, broke up the diamond of truth and scattered it over the earth and then, watching the earth's inhabitants  from their celestial heights, laughed to see how they eagerly ran to gather up the fragments, each one thinking that his fragment  was the whole truth. 

 Sir William Hornell spoke very briefly and with a touching humility, warmth and sincerity. 

He recalled Martha Root's  

 visit to him while he was in Hong Kong and said,


<p200>
200             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  "In the students' union of the University I arranged for a meeting, to which there came Chinese students and some members of the University staff. Martha Root gave her mes —  sage. She is dead; the University is a looted shell, but the memory of that evening abides. I have many friends among the Baha'is and what has impressed me most is their kindness to one another and also to those outside their pale, and it is that spirit which I think is going to contribute a great deal to the success  of the movement. I venture in all humility to warn the Baha'is not to be carried away by the slogans and clich6s of the market place. I have read in one of your books that 'Abdu'l-Baha concluded his message  to the congress of races in London with these words: CCLCt brotherhood be felt and seen among you and carry ye its quickening power throughout the world." 
     "To this I would say tAmen'."

 Dr. Harold Moody brought greetings from the League of Coloured Peoples and his own personal greetings. 

 He spoke oniy a few words, but made a deep impression on the audience by the calm dignity of his personality and the beautiful quality of his voice. He said, ttj feel you are engaged upon a great movement. 

 You have triumphed over many difficulties and I am convinced you are determined  to go on to still greater triumphs and I want to say God bless and prosper you. Out of this revelation something is going to come for the benefit of humanity. 

 It rests upon every one of us to play our part effectively.  You want not only to have a great faith but to practice that faith day by day in your lives In the world that is dawning  no one is too young and no one too old to heal the breaches which divide mankind." 

 Norman Smith spoke with moving simplicity  of Baha'u'llah's claim to nothing but the hearts of mankind. 'tAddressing the Kings and rulers of the earth, Baha'u'llah told them He had not come to wrest their kingdoms from them. tMy mission is to capture and keep the hearts of men'." 

 He spoke of the Baha'is meeting in the Baha'i Temple on the shores of Lake Michigan on this day, and concluded by saying: "It is the Baha'i message to make everyone happy and enjoy the fruits of the spiritual conquest of the hearts and minds of all mankind, so that all men might live as brothers and the kingdom of God shall be established on earth." 

 Miss Isenthal closed the meeting with reading a message from Sir John Martin Harvey (who had originally accepted to be present at the meeting), sent very shortly before his death. 
                           
         MESSAGES                   

 From J. D. BERESFORD (author) Although I am not a member of your Assembly, I am glad to have this opportunity of saying how profoundly I am in agreement with your fundamental aim of the unification  of mankind, and with your general beliefs as to the means by which alone that unity can be obtained. 

 I would subscribe more particularly to those statemenzs made by Baha'u'llah in ccHidden Words," in which he stresses the need for simplicity in our faith. 

 For I believe that in their preoccupation with ritual and dogma, the churches' neglect to teach such first principles is responsible for much of presentday materialism and its disastrous results in the present world war. 

 I send you, therefore, my most sincere good wishes for the enlargement of your Assembly and the spread of your faith, and assure you that many of us have similar aims, and are ready to add our endeavours to yours, whether by practice, speaking or writing. 
                           
From DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE  

  May I send greetings to the Baha'is at their Centenary. 

 I have read your booklet with much interest and the faith expressed in it is so close to the faith I hold and mast Christians hold, that I feel sure the good you are doing is great. I wish I could be at the meeting but evenings are my working hours when in the theatre which is almost always. 
     Good wishes for good cooperation.

  From REGINALD SORENSON, 

Mi?.

 don to many in the past 100 years and that it continues to do so now when once again we blast and mutilate and destroy, for it reaches beneath the evil that men do — to the imperishable common things of our deeper life wherein there is the reconciliation of divinity and the source of ultimate harmony. 

 These days of tragedy are also times of endurance, fortitude and courage. 

 They are times of great opportunity to bear witness still to those principles upon which true peace alone can find foundation. 

 I trust, therefore, there will be the notes of hope and confidence during your celebration  and that in the next century your Movement will continue to serve the truest needs of our common humanity and bring nearer that World Commonwealth which is the destiny of the race. 

  From the late SIR                JOHN MARTIN HARVEY, D.Litt. 

  You honour me with a request that I should add my small brick to the exalted edifice of the Baha'i teaching. 

 Its happy creed so passionately urged and so convincingly stated is an inspiration to all who work and who, in the words of Kipling, have real-ised  the. significance of t~No one shall work for money and no one shall work for fame, but all for the joy of the working." 

 I would like to add my conviction to your teaching that Crabsolute equality is a chimera"  which, socially, is entirely impracticable.  It has become a slogan to many workers, reliance upon which will oniy lead to a cruel disillusionment. 

 The oniy ctequa1~ ity" is that which any man may attain by being prominent in his work. It has been truly said that "every man can do some one thing better than any other man." So let our ambition be, no matter how humble our work may appear, to be of the aristocracy of work. And if to "work is to pray" may not this noble ambition to be among the elect of the workers of the world, bring us by steps to the dream of your great Teacher of a Great Universal Peace, against which if any government among you take up arms to destroy that peace, "the whole human race," he tells, "shall resolve with every power at its disposal to destroy." 

  From SIR ERNEST BENNETT, 

MY.                       

  The Baha'i Faith claims to offer a fresh presentation of Christ's teaching —  sincere and unequivocal. 

 Its three million adherents may, with God's help, form a great spiritual nucleus for the furtherance of a Faith which will definitely refuse to acqUiesce in war, just as our Christian forefathers refused to acquiesce in slavery, and at length triumphed over a great evil. 

  From   DR. HEWLETT JOHNSON, 

   Dean of Canterbury        

  I read with interest the social programme of your movement demonstrating the best education for everyone, equal status for men and women and the like and also your encouragement  of scientific research and emphasis on the need for a World Commonwealth,  together with the 6neness of mankind. 

 I am in complete agreement with those aims and wish you well in the pursuit of them. 
                          
   From HANNEN SWAnKER       

  Baha'is have to offer to Mankind something without which there can be no New World, no social order based on equality, no idealism in which all can share. It is a religion which opposes that sectarianism which nar-tows  faith into prejudice and keeps knowledge within the limits of what does not deny Orthodoxy. 

 Creeds are the enemy of all who can see beyond them. Rituals arc as repetitionary as a praying-wheel. 

 Both cause divisions where there should be brotherhood. 

 In the New World of our dreams there can be no differences of caste or creed or colour. Because it not oniy proclaims that selfevident truth but shows how one can live up to it, the Baha'i faith shines like a torch amid darkness, and is a signpost pointing  out, in a wilderness of delusion and deceit,  a path that, however rocky, leads to a land of bounty that all may share, a land of hope in which all will one day find happiness.

           BAHA'I CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS
                      IN INDIA

 rrl IHIS night," the Bib had declared, when He revealed His Mission, "this very hour will, in the days to come, be celebrated as one of the greatest and most significant of all festivals." In accordance with this promise,  in spite of the conflagration that was raging in the world, various countries had made preparations to befittingly celebrate this Festival. 
India was one of these.    

 Burma, unfortunately, was still cut off from us. Due instructions were received from the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith a year in advance,  regarding the nature and scope of the proposed celebrations. 

 His secretary wrote on June 22, 1943 to the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of India: t~ — The Guardian feels that the N.S.A. must from now on coordinate its plans and set in motion its preparations for the centenary celebrations. 

 The believers must hold gatherings f or the Ba-h~'is at exactly 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset on May 22nd 1944 as this is the exact time when the B&b declared His mission to Mull& Husayn. 

 They should also a?range to hold public gatherings on May 23rd and enlist the support of prominent friends of the Faith as speakers, together with Baha'i speakers, on that occasion. They should, as far as possible, hold festive gatherings at this time, give banquets — at which friends of the Cause and believers are present, obtain as much space in the press of India as possible,  and in general devise ways and means of making this a glorious and memorable celebration. 

 He would also like to have the N.S.A. publish in conjunction with the centenary,  a pamphlet giving a brief outline of the Faith's origin and teachings and major events in India since its establishment there, and a detailed outline of the accomplishments of the Indian Baha'i community, its early history, its development, etc." 

     The National Spiritual     

 Assembly followed the lines indicated by the Guardian. Two committees were appointed: one in charge of the celebrations, the other to compile the history of the Baha'i Cause in India during the first century. They commenced their task in right earnest. 

 Delhi was first fixed as the site of the national celebrations. A bulletin was issued in August 1943. 

 It touched briefly on the origin of the Faith, gave a summary of its aims and teachings from the Guardian's writings, referred to the forthcoming celebrations projected at the capital during May 1944, and requested those who were in sympathy with its objects and intended to participate in the forthcoming proceedings, to give prior notice to the committee in charge of the arrangements. 

 The second bulletin was issued in March 1944. 

 Delhi had been considered unsuitable due to its excessive heat during May and Bombay fixed as the venue of the national celebrations. 

 This bulletin referred to the sacrifice in human life on which the foundation of the Cause had been laid, gave a summary of the Teachings from the Guardian's pen, and concluded with an invitation to the well-wishers of humanity to join the forthcoming  celebrations in Bombay from the 24th to the 26th of May. A supplement contained tributes to the Faith from eminent non-BaM'is. 

 Five thousand invitations were printed and sent out on the eve of the celebrations. One thousand posters were displayed all over Bombay. Streamers were suspended over busy Street intersections. 

 Five thousand handbills were distributed. A colored slide was displayed in each of these nine leading cinemas for the week ending with the conclusion  of the celebrations: Metro, Ero~, Empire, Majestic, Roxy, Palace, Broadway, Strand, and Andlieri. 

 Fifteen thousand copies of "The World Religion" by Shoghi Effendi and five thousand  copies of "Religion of the Future" by K. T. Shad were printed and distributed free.

 Five hundred copies of a pamphlet in memory of the services in India of Miss Martha Root, international Baha'i teacher, were published and distributed free. 

 One thousand copies of the first section, covering a period of 5 0 years, of the history of the first Baha'i century in India were printed and distributed free at the celebrations  and later in response to the inquiries arising from th& Press articles. 

 So wide was the publicity that the India News Parade, a News Film Department of the Government of India, considered the function important enough to be filmed. A copy of the film was sent to the Guardian. It shows Mr. Nagindas Master, the Mayor of Bombay, ascending the platform and in —  augurating the local lectures at Bombay at the Sundarabai Hall on the 23rd May; Mr. Taunton inaugurating the national celebrations at the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Hall on the 24th, several of the speakers at the public addresses on the three days and inmates of the Institution for the

COMMEMORATION OF THE DECLARATION OF
THE BiB                    

  The blest evening, the eve prior to the 23rd of May 1944, arrived. 

 The members of the National Spiritual Assembly, the delegates  to the Convention, and a large number of friends had gathered in Bombay to celebrate the Centenary of the Faith whose impact  upon society had shaken it to its very foundations. 

 The Bombay Baha'i hail where the friends met was tastefully decorated and brilliantly lighted. 

 Those that had assembled bowed their heads in gratitude at the bounty of having been guided to the path of Truth. 

 They greeted and congratulated each other and in a spirit of reverent humility and pious devotion ushered in that momentous,  that fateful hour when, 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset, a hundred years ago, the gates of Heaven had once again


<p204>
204             THE BAH                  opened and mankind been assured that though he had forgotten his God, God had not forsaken him. 
The packed hail was hushed.

 An atmosphere of consecration and a thankfulness too deep for words prevailed. In a spirit of prayer the following program was carried out: 1.     A prayer by the B~b 

     2.     Sdrih-i-Mulk

This was one of the scenes of our celebrations  that was "shot" by the Government Film Department that of itself had volunteered  to film our proceedings. 

 Mrs. S. Fozdar in welcoming the audience on the inauguration day, dwelt on the importance of the occasion, the early persecutions  of the followers of the Faith and its spread throughout the world. She told how, in the past, religion had renewed itself whenever the world had become corrupt, and how history had repeated itself in this age. She touched upon the Principles of the Cause and wound up with a passionate appeal to the hearers to respond to Baha'u'llah's Message. 

 Two thousand printed copies of this address were distributed. A microphone had been provided to carry the voice of the speakers to the farthest corners of the large hail. Representatives of the leading papers were present. 

 Mr. Taunton, in inaugurating the lectures, said that he had been interested in the Baha'i teachings by his mother thirty years ago when she had placed a Baha'i book in

  his hand and asked him to study it. After getting acquainted with the Baha'i tenets he had felt confident that nations could come to a peaceful settlement by the plan of Baha'u'llah. 

 Who could deny, he said, the need f or Universal Brotherhood, Universal Peace, Universal Education, The Oneness of Mankind, 

A Universal Language       
or an International  Tribunal?

 In order to understand the importance of this Message man must free his mind from prejudices. 

 He was followed by Mr. K. T. Shah, the wellknown economist who, in spite of indifferent  health had been kind enough to attend, and who, speaking on "The Economic  Foundations of Peace," said "Nations must be federated under a world federal system ruling the whole earth and exercising unchallengeable authority over its vast resources."  ~tSuch a plan," said Prof. Shah, "had been visualised by Baha'u'llah, the centenary  of whose faith they were celebrating." 

 Mr. Koreshi, who followed, spoke on the ccNeed of a Universal Religion." 

  After a vote of thanks was passed to Mr. Taunton, and he and the speakers were garlanded,  the meeting terminated. Light refreshments were served to the audience and pamphlets distributed among them. 

 The need for a common religion which would be free from all the defects and blemishes  of the existing religions, and which should appeal to the intellects and. hearts of all was emphasised by Dr. B. S. Moonje, presiding over the second day session of the Baha'i Centenary celebrations held at the Sir Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Bombay, on Thursday, the 25th May, 1944. The proper description of what was now termed religion, he added, was "dharma." 

 Amplifying the meaning of the word "dharma," Dr. Moonje said it was that which brought about fixation and maintenance of the universe and which led to visible pros

 perity and ultimate absolution into the original spirit of all creations on earth. 

 Dr. Moonje further stated that he had heard of the Baha'i Faith many years ago when he was attending an All Faiths' Conference. 

 He had great admiration for the Baha'i teachings, and had felt very happy to be given the opportunity to participate in the celebrations. 

 He asserted that in a country like India torn by dissension and prejudices the Baha'i Message of unity and nonviolence was very essential, and he assured the audience that India needed the Baha teachings so badly that he on his part was quite prepared to protect it even with the sword if necessary. 

 Prof. T. Reuben, speaking on 'tReligion of the Future," said that the world was now passing through cruel and inhuman times, the tragedy moving on with dreary futilities.  It was not a question of East or 'West, he said. 

 Historical religions had not been able to achieve unity among mankind, and if humanity intended to get rid of this wicked and brutal age, what was necessary, he added, was a faith based on the firm bedrock  of universal unity. Religion should be spiritual and not ritual. 

 The Baha'i Faith, said Mr. Abbas Au Butt, recognised the unity of God and His power, while condemning all superstitions. He traced the growth and spread of the Faith in the Far 

East and West.             

 Dr. K. K. Bhargava, speaking on t'Science and Religion," said that science had ignored things like human emotions and spirit. 

 Mr. G. L. Melita, President, Indian Merchants'  Chamber, presided over the lectures delivered on the 26th May at the Sir C. J. Hall. 

 Mr. Manu Subedar, B.A., B.Sc., M.L.A. (Central), leading economist and Bar-at-Law,  spoke on "Prelude to World Society." 

 Prof. Pritam Singli was the next spea1.~er. His subject was "Economics of the Baha'i Faith." 

     Diwan Bahadur Ramaswami    

 Sastri, Ex —  Sessions Judge, Madras, followed him. 

 His subject which he explained in detail was CC1 di and the Baha'i Cause." 

 On the 26th of May, in another section of the city addresses in the vernacular were being given for the benefit of those who did not know English. In the Marwari Vidalaya Hall, four Baha'is spoke in Urdu, Hindi and Gujarati. 

 Dr. Moonje who had consented to preside was unable to come; so Mr. A. Butt took the chair. 

 Pamphlets in the vernaculars were distributed  among the audience after the lectures. 

 In the evening of the 24th of May, Mrs. S. Fozdar spoke through the Bombay radio. The appreciation of the Baha community of India is gratefully tendered to the Director  of Broadcasting who despite the short notice and the current war restrictions on radio talks allowed our message to be broadcast. 

 On the night of the 29th and 30th of May, dinners were given to a few from among the wellknown citizens of Bombay as rationing reguhtions restricted the number  of guests at any party to fifty. 

 On the first night Mrs. S. Fozdar spoke to the guests; Mr. Abdullali Fadil on the second. Mr. 

Shuaib Koreshi, Minister   

 of Bhopal State, who was present on the first night, thanked the Baha and expressed his appreciation for their ceaseless labors in strengthening the foundations of world unity. 

 On the night of the 29th and the afternoon  of the 3 0th the friends, too, were entertained  at a repast. The Guardian had cabled £300 as his "contribution

      Mayor Presides Over Centenary

  Bombay, Tuesday, "Mahatma Gandhi told me many years ago that the Baha'i Faith was a solace to mankind and that he had


<p208>
208             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  many friends among Baha'is" said the Mayor of Bombay, Mr. Nagindas Master, presiding over a spiritual meeting held in connection with the Baha'i Centenary celebrations at the Bal Sunderbai Hall this evening. He stated that the little he knew of the Baha'i Faith had interested him a great deal. It stood for spirituality and selflessness and its tenets, if they were more widely accepted, would usher a new order of things into the world and give to it the peace and ordered Government that was so dire a need today. The Mayor concluded with a prayer that peace may come to the world and guide mankind to the happiness and tranquility that it so greatly lacked today. 

 Mrs. Shirin Fozdar, the Chairman of the Reception Committee, gave history of the religions of the world, making the plea that religious belief was responsible for the greatness of nations and peoples, who deteriorated in proportion to their loss of faith. 

 This period of religious and material decline  had invariably been the birth of some great Prophet who had striven to lead the nations once again to the path of religious righteousness. 

 A hundred years ago the great Baha'u'llah was born and his mission was to bring faith to an irreligious world — a world which today found itself in the midst of an international conflict, the like of which it had never known before. The Prophet of the Baha'is had predicted the wave of calamity that the world had today seen fulfilled. 

 He had predicted a World Federation of Powers that would lead modern civilization from chaos to order. Every unit of the Federation would disarm completely. There would be one international monetary system, one language and one police force. 

 Raw material would be held in trust for the smaller nations by the Federation. 

 Women would have equal rights with men. This would lead to universal brotherhood in which everyone would live happily forever after.

           BAHA'I CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS
                      IN EGYPT

  As a unique occasion the 

 Centennial Anniversary   

 was celebrated leaving the loveliest memories in the hearts of the participants in Egypt. 

 For future generations the magnitude of that occasion will be found in illustrious records, flooded with spiritual delight and hope, which the growing community of the Baha'i Faith can cherish during dreary days of worldwide disaster. 
 The golden fruit of the   

 Mb's historic Declaration 

 grew and ripened through the heroic sacrifice of twenty thousand believers. 

 The glad tidings which, coincident with the Declaration of the Mb, announced the birth of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Center of the Mighty Covenant of Baha'u'llah, heralded the new stage of divine civilization towards which the world of humanity is advancing speedily. The mighty link which 'Abdu'l-Baha shaped in His Will and Testament has joined together the first, yet most remarkable age of this Creative Revelation, with the destined future  stages of its evolution which, in due time, under the guidance of the Guardian of the Cause, will lead to the consummation of the New World Order of 

 Baha'u'llah. the Glory    
 of the age.               

 Thus the tragic times in the course of which the Centenary was celebrated can never dim its light. 

 On the contrary future generations will testify to the mighty Power of the Faith which held aloft the torch of its rlaims during the most stormy age in the history of the world. 
                           
 PREPARATIONS FOR THE CENTENARY

  In 1943, nearly a year before the Centenary, the National Spiritual Assembly devoted  serious consultation to the question of celebrations. For many reasons the prospects offered little hope of success. The Haziratu'1-Quds was still in course of corn

  pletion and no one could guess when it would be ready. On the other hand, to hold the celebrations in a suitable hotel was a matter beyond our financial resources. 

 Such was the position that kept us fluctuating between hope and despair. 
                           
COMPLETION OF HAZfRATU'L-QtYDS

  By the end of 1943, our hopes for the completion of the Ua~iratu'1-Quds were renewed by the gracious contributions which continued to flow from the beloved Guardian.  Although materials were difficult to procure, the work was carried on without cessation until the third story was completed. 

 The carpentering was entrusted to three committees, in Cairo, Beni-Suef, and Port Sa'id. Electrical installments were contributed by the friends of Beni-Suef, and the plaster by Part 

Sa'id.                     

 Concerning the dome, there seemed no prospect whatever of being able to construct it in time. Funds were lacking, materials were unprocurable; and, moreover, the cele brations were swiftly approaching and only twenty days remained. But the irresistible power of Baha'u'llah made all things possible  beyond our fondest expectations. The following cable dated April 21 was received from the beloved Guardian: '~Wiring through Anglo-Palestine Bank five hundred pounds for (the) dome (of) Ua?ira. 

 Proceed immediately with construction." 

 Upon the receipt of that cable materials were miraculously procured, work was carried on even by night by special permission — and the dome was completely finished just two hours before the programs were scheduled to commence! 
                           
ANNOUNCEMENT OF CENTENARY  

  Following is the first message of the National Spiritual Assembly regarding this matter circulated among the Baha'is in 

Egypt:                     
         "Beloved ones of the Blessed

 this greatest Revelation will ciose, will soon strike announcing the termination of an unparalleled age of heroism. The spirits of those who gave up their lives for the sake of this day are now moving around us to console their eyes with the panorama of the heavenly blossoms which were profusely watered by their pure blood, and to behold how the Cause of God is deepening its roots and stretching out its branches to overshadow the peoples of the world. 

 ttStupendous is the Day, and great is the sign of God in this Majestic Dispensation! How mysterious that the radiance of the first and formative stage of our Faith has shed its beams upon the worldwide progress of its second stage! How miraculous the way its penetrating light is spreading and ushering in the Golden Age decreed by Baha'u'llah, whose advent was heralded by all the 

Prophets of God!          

 CtO Faithful! Now that you stand between  two historic ages — witnesses of the first and trustees of the second, the spiritual tree of the first and the divine fruit of the second, you should thank your Lord that you have been blessed with such a bounteous gift, which is the glory of the ages. 

 "The glad tidings of the Day to you is that you should cast aside the old and prepare  yourselves for the new age which is swiftly approaching! 

 The glad tidings, 0 steadfast in the covenant, is that you should turn away at once from that which was once the cause of grief to the heatts. 

 The glad tidings to you, 0 Symbol of love and unity, is that each one of you should hasten to embrace his brother with sheer iove and eagerness! Shut your eyes against shortcomings, and cling unto love and unity! Let our sign on this blessed occasion be the praise of one another! 

 "The occasion is incomparably unique and precious. It imposes upon us the obligation of advancing towards it with united efforts and perfect oneness so tht't the light of the wonderful Order of our Faith may shine upon the world, so that the people may witness  in the unity of this growing community the example of love, unity, and cooperation. 

 "The forces of discord are tearing humanity, and the elements of corruption are upsetting  the structure of life. The torch of hope seems as if quenched in the hearts and the candle of spiritual delight extinguished. Therefore, 0 Light-holders, let the flame of hope reblaze in the world, and blow through the trumpets of life the psalms of faithfulness, and the melodies of the Kingdom  of the Father whereby hopes may be restored to wandering humanity! 

 "Exalted be our Lord that He made you His Trustees and the Heirs of His 

Grace.                    

 (CD friends: "As we are drawing closer to that momentous  day the National Spiritual Assembly desires to announce that preparations for the celebrations are being adequately planned. 

 "A bead committee of Mohamed Sa'id, Chairman, Hussein Ruhi, Abul Fetouh Bat-tab, and Mohamed MustaTh, members, has been appointed. 

 It is charged with the formation of such subcommittees as various activities may require. It is also empowered to contact the Local Assemblies and groups on matters relative to the celebrations. 

The National Spiritual    

 Assembly fervently prays for your success under the guidance of our beloved Guardian, may our souls be a ran-soin  for him.~~ 

      CELEBRATIONS RECEIVE PERMISSION OF
AUTHORITIES               

  In accordance with the law, the National Spiritual Assembly approached the authorities  concerned through the following letter dated May 13: 

       (CTJ~ Ma'mour of Waili

Shafik Street.            

 "The program is arranged for the 22nd and 23rd of May inclusive, and will be attended  by Baha'is only the expected number of whom will be approximately four hundred. 

 in view of the fact that the program includes refreshments and meals, tents will be pitched alongside the building for that purpose.

  The following was received through the local authorities:

Commandant; Division A.    

 ~tWith reference to your excellency's letter  dated 15th Inst. concerning the permission  applied for by the Baha'is to hold their religious celebrations on Monday and Tuesday, 22nd and 23rd Inst. in their headquarters,  No. 6 Fouad Shafik Street, on the occasion of the Baha'i Centenary and the inauguration of their headquarters, I have no objection to these celebrations being held provided that they are devoted to the purposes  detailed in the application. 

 (rArrangements should, therefore, be made so as to observe those celebrations and to maintain order and public security. 

 "An officer should attend them and send a daily report to reach this office on the morning of the following day.

    Inside Haziratu'I-Quds     

  A large number of participants was expected  and many nonBahA'is expressed their desire to attend. 

 According to lists, no less than five hundred seats were to be provided inside the building, and almost the same number outside in the tents for refreshments and meals. 

 Due to this large attendance and the impossibility of using oniy one story, the basement,  known as the first story, was provided for children, the main hail for gentlemen, and the third story for the ladies. Loudspeakers were installed in such a way as to enable the three stories to hear the lectures delivered from any of the stories. 
                           
Outside Haziratu'l-Quds    

  Big tents were pitched where refreshments  and banquets were served during the days of the celebrations. 
                           
Beloved Guardian Contributes

  On March 21, 1944, the following cablegram  was received from our beloved 

Guardian:                 

 "Cabling three hundred pounds (being) my contribution for centenary celebration and banquets (on) my behalf for delegates (and) friends gathered (in) UaPra (to) commemorate (that) historic occasion." 

 By that valuable contrIbution of the beloved  Guardian the National Spiritual Assembly  was able to celebrate the Centenary in the most attractive and delightful manner. 

 Baha'is and non-Bah6his, rich and poor enjoyed alike the generosity of our beloved Guardian, and all those who were privileged to attend will never forget the magnitude of the celebrations, and the wonderful spirit which prevailed among them. 
                           
CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS     
BEGIN                      

  Lists received from various Assemblies and centers showed an approximate number of 500, besides fifty nonBahA'is who attended  the celebrations. 

 The question of accommodating a big number of participants was very difficult to solve. 

 Only a few hotels in far localities were available; but it was not practicable to provide accommodations therein unless arrangenlents should be made for comfortable transportation, and that was another difficulty. 

 We owe thanks to the Baha'is of Cairo for their hospitality. They offered their houses for proportionate numbers to stay. So all the guests were distributed  among the different houses of the friends where they enjoyed comfort. 

 At 17.30 hours the celebrations started. In the basement, first story, the children up to the age of twelve had their seats. In the second story, the main hail was completely filled by about two hundred gentlemen. The third story was occupied by the ladies of about the same number. 

 Outside the building various committees were fulfilling their work. 

 Order was wonderfully observed. The spirit of peace prevailed; fragrances of spiritual  love and brotherhood were diffused; such were the characteristics of that historic  occasion. 

 Baha'is and non-Bah4'is alike were conscious that something new, something that is matchless in this mortal world, something that may be well termed as life-giving, was about to be announced for the first time! Even the children whose cheerful and merry

  Baha'i Centenary Celebrations in Cairo, Egypt, May, 1944. A spacious tent was pitched next to the National Baha'i Headquarters for the entertainment of the Baha'is and their guests; hundreds of peopie banqueted daily here during the period of festivities.


<p214>
214             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  souls do not know restrictions, were keenly sensible of a more spacious sphere of spiritual delight which the loudspeakers would soon transmit to them! 

 In fact, not a single Baha individual could foresee the Majestic  power of the Word as he witnessed it in the course of the celebrations. 

 No single nonBahA'i individual could have ever dreamed of a celebration, whatever its occasion,  religious or national, so wonderful, so attractive, so spiritual and peaceful as this was. 

 Turning to the neighbours near and far, one could see them crowded on balconies, in windows, and in the roads to behold the splendour of the Faith. 

 Hundreds were gathered outside, eager to listen and to know as much as possible of these celebrations. 

 All the wireless sets of the neighbouring houses were turned down, and the Centenary loudspeakers refreshed their spirits with new delight, with cheerful hopes such as they never enjoyed in their daily programs. Many poor people gathered around the building, and in daily increasing numbers they enjoyed meals. 

 The attendants comprised different nationalities and faiths. Moslems, Christians, and Jews gathered together in one hail, united under the same tent of the on2ness of mankind. By such wonderful evidences the religions of the past seemed to meet after a long separation rejoicing in the Declaration of Him whom God made the hope of the world and the saviour of humanity. 

 To the observers, the matter looked still more astonishing. 

 Usually celebrations of any character were dimmed either by opposing  parties, shameful acts or disturbances that made the police authorities have to arrange beforehand for forces adequate to keep order and maintain public security. But here were celebrations commemorating the Declaration 0f the Word of God, illustrating the fact of the wide progress of the Faith, a Faith which is still condemned ignorantly by the misled masses, a Faith which is forging  ahead in this biggest and foremost center  of the Islamic world despite the innumerable obstacles that lie in its way, a Faith which, in spite of successive attacks of persecution on its followers, and the various historic verdicts, fatwas and sentences  assured by Moslem courts by which they sought to impede the advance of the movement and to exterminate it, steadily marches on, and yet not a single policeman attended! 

 Furthermore the spiritual fundamentals of our Faith and its administrative system functioned hand in hand, and brought the purpose and aim of this Divine Grace to a wide display. 

 Principles of brotherhood, unity, peace, love, and oneness of religion were demonstrated as established facts. 

 The absolute equality of man and woman, a ques-don of the east, discredited and derided by most of the religious leaders, provisionally tolerated by more advanced classes, and maintained by the feminist movement supported  by a minority of women advocators, was developed and realized by the teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 Youth of both sexes participated throughout  in the services and took actual part in the Centenary activities, proving the progressive spirit of Baha'u'llah which emancipates  them from the defects and corruption of life and makes them not only lively elements in their milieu but also the light-bearers  of worldwide reformation. 

 By these, and many other features, characterizing the Centenary celebrations in general, a turning point was reached in the range of the expansion of the Cause in Egypt and in the intensity of the efforts its adherents  are making. 

 As to the integrity of the teachings of Baha'u'llah and the undisturbed nature of the celebrations, the followi4 copy of the report of the local police authorities is suffiCient  testimony: "On the 22nd/5/1944 religious celebrations  were held at the headquarters of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is, 6 Fouad Shafik Street, on the occasion of the Baha'i Centenary and the inauguration of the headquarters. Celebrations started at 10.00    hours to 13.30 hours and from 17.30 to 21.00 hours. They were attended by about 340 persons, men, ladies, and children.

  The centennial celebrations took the form of a symposium in which the addresses and lectures dealt with religious and social matters. 

 Other than to indicate them is beyond the scope of this article; but they will be shown in full in the Arabic edition of the Centenary record. 

 The wonderful spirit in which the celebrations were conducted and the far-reach-ing  results which the Centenary had and continues to have are established by the ff1-lowing  cablegram dated, July 16, 1944, from the beloved Guardian: rcHeart rejoiced (by) the magnificent spirit reflected (in the) recently received Annual and Convention reports.

           BAHA'I CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS
                      IN 'IRAQ

THE National Spiritual    

 Assembly of the Baha of 'IrAq, in formulating the program of the celebration for this historic Centennial Anniversary, the termination of the First Century of the Baha'i Era, attentively studied the instructions sent by our beloved Guardian to the National Spiritual Assemblies  of the Baha'is of the United States of America and Canada, Persia and 'IrAq. 

 Taking into consideration the significance and importance of this sacred occasion, and bearing in mind the urgent wish of our beloved Guardian to utilize to the fullest extent this opportunity to unfold the magnificence  of the Baha'i Faith and demonstrate the vitality, significance and importance  of the Mission of the Bab, proclaimed on that sacred night in Shir4z, and to exert its utmost power to draw the attention of the largest possible number of people to the New World Order associated with the name of Baha'u'llah, taking these facts into con-sideratien,  the program was arranged in March about two months prior to the time of the celebration. 

 Copies of the program were duly sent to all Baha'i centers in order to inform and prepare the Believers for a better presentation of the fundamental principles of the Faith on that sacred occasion. 

     The National Spiritual    

 Assembly was to a great extent assisted by two committees duly formed for the purpose of conducting the program of the Centennial Anniversary of the Baha'i Faith in the most attractive manner. 

 The members of these committees, under the supervision of the National Assembly,  made the meetings of the Anniversary  an enviable pattern for a public meeting. 

 The Baha'i women celebrated the Anni

  versary separately. They followed their own program which the National Spiritual Assembly  arranged and which was executed by a committee of five members appointed by the Assembly for this purpose. 

 The first night of the Celebration, for the Baha'is only, was held in commemoration of the Declaration of the Bib and the birth of 'Abdu'l-Baha, on Monday, May 22, 1944, two hours and eleven minutes after sunset. The Haziratu'1-Quds appeared on that historic night in the most charming and attractive  form. 

 Its walls were decorated with the most precious Persian rugs and the twelve basic distinctive principles of the Baha'i Faith were written in very large characters on large, white linen sheeting hung on the front walls of the guest house confronting the visitors and callers. 

 The foundation hail was well furnished with sofas and chairs and the Haziratu'1-Quds itself was profusely flooded with light. 

 At the precise and momeatous moment of the Declaration of the Bab, all the believers were seated solemnly, with hearts throbbing in gratitude and ardent praise and glorification of God for the immeasurable bounties vouchsafed them in attaining this glorious day, and in being in this place on this most sacred night to commemorate the significant, glorious 

Centennial Anniversary   

 of the establishment of the Kingdom of the 

Father.                   

 All the Baha'is of Baghdid and delegates of the Fourteenth Annual Convention, as well as representatives of the Baha'i centers in Iriq such as Mosul, Sulaymaniyyih, Kar-kak,  KhAnaqin, Baha'u'llah, Huvaydar, 'Av&shiq, Idhybih, Sliaraban, Khirnabat, Abu-Saydih, 'Aziziyyih, 'Am~irih, Mutay-va'ah  and Basrib, were invited by the Na. tional Spiritual Assembly and had the honor of participating in the celebration of this magnificent Baha'i 

Centenary Feast.

Thus they celebrated the commemoration  of that divine Declaration, the Dawn of the Day of God, the establishment of the Kingdom of the Father on earth, and with wholehearted sincerity and touching humility, and with a sense of profound rapture, they heard the grave pronouncement addressed by the Mb to the first Letter of the Living, the first to believe in Him and accept His divine mission: "This night, this very hour will, in the days to come, be celebrated as one of the greatest and most significant of all festivals.

 BAHA'I CENTENARY PROGRAM FOR
THE BAHA'I WOMEN           

  Monday, May 22, 1944 A word should be said in this connection that the National Spiritual Assembly, in direct obedience to our beloved Guardian's instructions, is continuing to arrange for the Baha'i women their own meetings, gatherings, and festivals. And the Baha'i women in 'Iraq are forming their own groups and committees and arranging their own activities. 

 Thus special Baha'i Centennial celebrations for the Baha'i ladies were arranged  and the program already formulated by the National Spiritual Assembly for them was successfully executed and carried out by them on the roof of the guest house.

The replies were a source of great joy and happiness to the friends. The National Spiritual Assembly also sent congratulatory cards to most of the BaJa&'i c~nters of the world and from many of them beautiful replies were received and have strengthened the ties of love and bonds of unity between the Baha'is of 'IrAq and their brothers and sisters in the Faith in other countries.

  THE greatest achievement in Australia and New Zealand since the forming of the National Spiritual Assembly in 1934, was the acquisition in 1944 of a building in Sydney, New South Wales, for our Ha4ra-tu'1-Quds. 

 In 1943 a cable saying he was donating £1,000 sterling towards the project,  gave us our first intimation of the Guardian's momentous decision that we were to have a National 

Administrative Headquarters. 

 How surprised and stirred we were. We had been considering how to fittingly celebrate the Centenary of our Faith; now a magnificent Centenary gift was being made to us by our beloved Guardian. In the midst of our rejoicing another cable came announcing a further contribution of £2,000 sterling from the Guardian and also that our beloved sister communities of East and West would associate themselves with us in the great enterprise. 

 In rapid succession came cables and generous contributions from the National Assemblies of the United States and Canada. Persia, 'Idq, India and Burma and a 

Persian believer Sohrab   

 Baha'i. The magnificent contribution of £2,500,£3,125 125 Australian currency, from the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia completely overwhelmed  us. That such a large contribution should come to us from our beloved fellow believers in Baha'u'llah's native land and that they should be associated with us, help us and take part in this, our greatest undertaking,  is a profoundly affecting experience for us. Our hearts overflowed with love and gratitude to them and to our dear Baha'i brothers and sisters of other lands who, although busy with their own great enterprises  and problems, yet find time and money to help us. We acknowledge with profoundest  gratitude the following contributions: 'Iraq £572.1O.O; India & Burma £174.8.O; United 

States and Canada £1 5    

 2.9.0; Solirab Baha'i £125.O.O and Persia £3,125.9.O;

Australian currency. The  
Australian and New Zealand

 believers were able to contribute  oniy comparatively small sums, it can therefore be truly said that the Guardian and the Baha'is of the world have given us our National Headquarters, they have 'also given us the inestimable joy of realizing as never before, the reality of our spiritual union with them. With the 1-{aziratu'1-Quds has come to Australia and New Zealand  a deeper consciousness of the meaning of Baha unity, that the followers of Baha'u'llah  are as many souis in one body and the process of establishing the Faith a world wide cooperative spiritual movement. 

 The search for a suitable property was commenced with great enthusiasm by Mrs. Routh and Mrs. Moflitt of Sydney and later they were assisted by Mrs. Jackman who went from Adelaide to Sydney for that purpose.  In reply to the secretary's questions the Guardian cabled that he wished the property to be within the city of Sydney. Mrs. Axford came from Auckland and the four members of the National Spiritual Assembly at that time engaged in the search decided to summon Miss Brooks and Mr. Fitzner to Sydney to inspect a property in College Street which is centrally situated. This building would have been purchased but for the fact that we could not obtain vacant possession of it. Cabled consultations with the Guardian resulted in his instruction to purchase the property No. 2, Lang Road, Centennial Park, first inspected; this we feel is an ideal choice. Great responsibility then devolved upon the members of the National Spiritual Assembly living in Sydney — resolutions were passed empowering them to act for the National 

Assembly.

  The building purchased for the Ua4ratu'l-Quds is a sixteen roomed, two story residence


<p224>
224             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  facing the entrance gates to Centennial Park, a public reserve of 600 acres. The entrance is good and the arrangement of the rooms excellent for our purpose. Double doors open from the large reception room into a small library and from the library into a large lecture room. When all the doors of these three adjoining rooms are open the effect is of dignified spaciousness. 

 Much time and energy were devoted by the members of the National Spiritual Assembly and friends in Sydney to preparing the premises for occupation. 

 Mrs. E. M. Axford personally directed and supervised alterations, furnishings and the interior decorating which was necessary. Despite wartime restrictions and shortages which hampered the work on every hand the Secretariat was established in the building by the end of 1944. After much sorting and packing, the Secretary and Treasurer, for ten years, Miss Hilda 

Brooks and Mrs. Silver    

 Jackman respectively, of Adelaide, South Australia, finally despatched all the files, books and other belongings of the National Spiritual Assembly to the new Headquarters in Sydney.  Miss Brooks, who had also been Keeper of the Archives, reverently carried the Precious Relic, lock of Baha'u'llah's hair, the pen cases and pens which had belonged to 'Abdu'1 — Baha, a framed specimen of 'Abdu'l-Baha's handwriting and various gifts from the Guardian, to Sydney in her personal luggage. 

 These former officers of the National  Spiritual Assembly had conducted all the clerical work in their own homes — it was therefore a great joy to them to know that in future national officers would enjoy the convenience and dignity of perfectly appointed and equipped offices, thus enabling the clerical work to be accomplished with greater ease and efficiency. In the rows of files and the office equipment at headquarters they see the fulfillment of their dreams. The new secretary, Mrs. Dive, now resides in the building. 

 The treasurer, Mr. N. Walker lives in Sydney. 

 The Sydney friends feel that working at headquarters is a labour of love and they have gladly given assistance in whatever way they could. Social functions are held at the headquarters and both local and national teaching work carried out there. 

 Many inquirers quirers have called to ask about the Baha'i Faith. 

The name "Haziratu'1-Quds"

 has brought forth many queries as to its meaning thus providing the believers with opportunities  to explain and expound the 

Teachings.                
                          
   CENTENARY CONVENTION      
                          
    The Centenary Convention  

 held 19th to 24th May 1944 in our newly acquired Haziratu'1-Quds, 2 Lang Road, Centennial Park, Sydney, New South Wales, was a time of great rejoicing and thanksgiving for the Australian and New Zealand Baha'i community. 

 Despite wartime travel restrictions all the delegates reached Sydney and were present. 

 The official opening of the kIa~iratu'1-Quds, the afternoon of the 21st May was a momentous and joyous occasion. 

 The faces of the believers were wreathed in smiles as with warm handclasps they affectionately greeted one another. Press representatives intending to stay only a few moments, remained  to the end of the proceedings, 1ist~n-ing to the addresses with great interest and appreciation. 
One reporter remarked,    

CCWhen the Baha'i Faith   

 is known, it will undoubtedly receive very wide acceptance." 

 in addition  to all the delegates, those present included  believers from Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, 

Yerrinbool, Caringbah     
and Wollon-gong.          

 How happy we were — this was the proudest  moment in the history of our community. How splendid in our grateful eyes was our Administrative Headquarters; our hearts overflowed with love and gratitude to our Guardian and the believers of other lands who had made the acquisition of the property possible. 

 Owing to the unremitting efforts of the Resident in Charge, Mrs. EL M. Axforcl and the Sydney members of the National Spiritual Assembly and friends, and despite the many setbacks and difficulties due to wartime restrictions, the reception room, library and lecture room, were redecorated  and ready for the opening day and presented a dignified and charming appearance. 

 The gathering filled the lecture room to overflowing, visitors as well as believers being among the audience. 

After the Convention


<p225>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 225

  Baha'i Centenary Banquet, attended by nearly three hundred people, held in the Lewis Eady Hall, Auckland, New Zealand, under the auspices of the Local Spiritual Assembly of that city, May 23, 1944. 

  Chairman Mrs. 0. Routh, had welcomed those present, prayers, the Victory Tablet and cables, telegrams and messages from National 

Assemblies, Local Assemblies

 and individuals, were read. Called upon to address  the gathering, the Chairman of the N.S.A., Mr. H. Fitzner said, "We are indeed humbly grateful for all this loving kindness and assistance which has enabled us to open these Headquarters today and we supplicate Baha'u'llah that we may be worthy of this great privilege and blessing. When we consider,  dear friends, that ten years ago we had no National Assembly and that the local assemblies were functioning almost as separate  bodies, we can understand more fully the great progress that has been made in Ad-nunistration. 

 "Notwithstanding many difficulties and obstacles, the National Assembly, as soon as it was formed in 1934, proceeded to func tion. To many of us administration was a little difficult and we could not at first grasp it; but the National members persevered and today we are indeed grateful to them. They faced the most difficult periods educating and guiding the Australian and New Zealand  Baha'i community to understand and establish the Administration. It is a triumph and a victory for the members of the 

National  Spiritual Assembly

 both past and present, that their untiring selfless efforts have been crowned with the glorious success and reward of these Administrative 

Headquarters."           

 Mrs. Axford then spoke, tracing the growth of the Faith in Australia and New Zealand, the coming of Mr. and Mrs. Hyde Dunn from America, the establishment of the National Spiritual Assembly and the Haziratu'1-Quds. 

 Mrs. Dunn spoke of her meeting with

  The dedication of the Baha'i National Headquarters of Australia and New Zealand marked the opening of the Centenary Convention in Sydney, New South Wales, May 20, 1944. 

  'Abdu'l-Baha and her coming to Australia. In the Haziratu'1-Quds she saw the tangible evidence of the labours of the believers and knew that they would carry still further the Message of Baha'u'llah. It was her great privilege to dedicate the house, 2, Lang Road, Centennial Park, Sydney, to the service  of Baha'u'llah. 

 After musical items had been rendered and refreshments served the Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly showed the press representatives over the building. A reporter remarked that he had heard so many wonderful  things during the afternoon, he had become deeply conscious of his own ignorance. 

 The addresses given by the delegates during the Convention sessions were instructive and helped to deepen the spirit of dedication to service of all the believers. 

 We enter the second Baha'i century full of confidence. The Haziratu'1-Quds, we know, will become a great centre from which the influence of the Baha'i Faith will be radiated over all Australia and New Zealand. 
                          
  CENTENARY CELEBRATIONS    

  On Tuesday 23rd July 1944, the Convention  delegates and friends were the guests of the Guardian at a buffet dinner at the Pickwick Club, Sydney. How thrilling to be the guests of the beloved Guardian; if oniy he could have been present in person as we know he was in spirit. It is the great ambition of all the believers to meet the Guardian personally and tell him face to face how we love him and appreciate all his gifts and goodness to us, and the protection of his guiding hand. 

 The Pickwick Club banqueting hail provided  a really beautiful setting for the happy occasion of this celebration. Guests included citizens of Sydney. 

 After dinner the gathering was photographed and several eloquent addresses given. Mrs. E. M. Axford, acting as Chairman, explained that this function


<p228>

 The addresses were interspersed with beautifully rendered vocal and pianoforte items. 

 It was a delightful occasion for all, and the believers will look back on it as one of the happiest events of the Centenary Convention.

                THE BAHA'I CENTENARY
                B~ MARION H. LONGYEAR

  THE participation of all Latin-American republics in the worldwide celebrations of the first Centennial of the Baha'i Era was of unique significance, and marked the first fruits of a spiritual harvest whose ultimate proportions are too vast for present estimate.  This fruition, indeed, was further enhanced in its direct connection with yet another Centenary celebration of a Baha'i Holy Day, and one likewise in tribute to the Herald of the Faith. For it was in 1919, the year of the one hundredth anniversary of the birthday of the Mb, that the initial impetus for the Spiritual Mission of America was unfolded to the awestruck believers attending  the Eleventh Baha'i Congress for the 

United States and Canada.  

 To the assembled  delegates and friends at the historic meeting came the call to the American believers  raised by 'Abdu'l-Baha, the 

Center of God's Covenant   

 with humanity, in the series of Tablets delineating the Divine Plan for the orderly achievement of peace, of progress and of unity for all the inhabitants of the earth. 

 It was Martha Root, arising in instant response, and setting forth on the first of her four world journeys, who bore the Charter of the New Age to the Southern Hemisphere of the West. 

 As the worldwide Baha'i community prepared to celebrate the Centenary of the Declaration of the Bab's divine Mission, oniy a short quarter of a century had elapsed since that early August day of 1919 when Martha Root first stepped upon the soil of South America and gave thanks to Baha'u'llah that His Faith had come to bless this vast and fertile land. The city of Para, in Brazil, situated at the mouth of the Amazon River, was the first point of Martha Root's arrival on the great continent. Over the brief period of two and a half decades other Baha'i visitors had pushed forward the frontiers of the new civilization, travelling teachers had brought their messages of inspiration,  and had been followed, in turn, by an intrepid band of resident pioneers. Baha'i Centers, bravely established, were to be found in every republic of Central and South America and of the Caribbean Isles; the spiritual vanguard of the Kingdom of God on earth had uplifted the banner of His Faith in each nation of that land. 

 The closing weeks of the first Baha'i Century found all these Latin-American centers, however large or small, however newly established,  busily engaged in a variety of plans for the Centenary celebrations. 

 The Guardian had formulated the suggestions for a befitting celebration for the American believers, to be held at the great "Mother Temple of the 'West" in Wilmette, the beautiful  suburb of Chicago, in conjunction with the 

Annual National Baha'i     
Convention. For Latin-American

 Baha'is, one of these suggestions  in particular held exhilarating interest. 

 From among the believers of each Latin-American republic, the Guardian had written, one member was to be elected to serve as the representative of that country, to participate in the first All-America Baha'i Convention. Every possible effort, the Guardian emphasized, was to be made to overcome the obstacles of travel limitations,  in order that as many as possible of these chosen delegates could be present and


<p229>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 229

  share in the consultation periods of the Convention's sessions, as well as the programs and festivities of the Centenary celebrations. 

 On the one hand then, the Latin-Ameri-can  communities were absorbed in preparations for the Convention journey of their representatives, and on the other, to whatever  degree was feasible, plans were under way for local celebrations of tribute to the event. 

 Elsewhere has been recorded the inspiring  contributions made by the delegates of these communities of the southern areas of the Americas, who, in due time returned to their homes to regale their coworkers with the news of their stirring experiences, and to engage with renewed vigor in intensified teaching activities. 

 What is to be told here are brief highlights of the celebrations  of those wh& stayed at home, celebrations  infinitely precious and far-reaching, no matter how simple they might seem in outward character. They too, these first believers of Latin-America, were heralds of the Faith of 

God.                      
                          
          MEXICO                    

  First to be mentioned by 'Abdu'l-Baha, as He listed the countries, one by one, was Mexico, and of its citizens He wrote that, "If one breath of life be blown over them great results will issue therefrom." It was Mexico which first responded to the Divine Voice and in the heart of her capital city was established the first Latin-American Baha'i community. 

     In Mexico City the Spiritual

 Assembly sponsored a public meeting which was well attended, and refreshments were served after the program, to add to the festive occasion. On a later date, a banquet was held at the Molino Restaurant, which was enjoyed by all the Baha'is and their guests. Miss Juliet Thompson, member of the New York community,  and a visitor in Mexico City at the Centenary time described these gatherings  of commemoration. 

 "On the night of May 22, the high room in the 

Baha'i Center of Mexico    

 City, where the meetings were held, was festooned from ceiling to floor with garlands of flowers made with such love and joy by the community members. There was beautiful music that evening, played by a young ]lah4'i pianist, Senorita 

Pilar Gutierrez, and Senor

 Jos6 Vergara read with great reverence the story of that sublime  night which we had gathered to commemorate. 

 CC ¶[ seemed to have been transported into the days of H~riinu'1-Rashid,' wrote a reporter  on Mexico's leading newspaper after attending our Centenary there. 

 CHOW can such a belief take root in skeptical Mexico? But that it has taken root is beyond doubt.' He devoted a three-column article, exceptionally accurate in its details, to the Principles  of the Faith. 

 ttThe Assembly of Mexico City," Miss Thompson continued, "also gave a banquet, attended by many guests who are not BaJA'is, and on this occasion two distinguished women educators spoke most sympathetically of the Faith, which had been proclaimed in the address of Senor Antonio Gonzalez 

Mon."                     
                          
 CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE   
                          
    CARIBBEAN ISLANDS         

  From the cluster of Central American republics, and their neighboring companions in the Isles of the Caribbean Sea, have come accounts, for the most part undetailed, of the programs dedicated to the Centenary anniversary, as it was observed in the local gatherings. 

 The fervor of their devotion found creative outlet in the arts, through the ardor of poetic praise of the New Day, in paintings inspired with the longing to glorify the Faith, in music evoking a new spirit of consecration to the Cause of God. Local publications of the Baha'i communities were focussed upon tributes to the Centenary and upon the opportunity for attracting new friends to know of the Divine Remedy which had been offered to an anguished  humanity. Other forms of pub-licky,  through the local press and over the radio, contributed a new impetus for the growth in the second century. 

 In each country, friendly gatherings of a significance far beyond the simplicity of the commemorative meetings inaugurated a new stage of consolidation and expansion. 

 The Baha'is of Haiti supported a series of functions covering the same period of days as prevailed at the Centenary Convention in the United States-Mr. 

Mr. Gerald Mc

  Bean supplied the following account of the program carried out under the supervision of the Spiritual Assembly of Port au Prince. 

 "On May 19 at sunset, our first meeting was opened with the Baha'i tPrayer For All Nations,' followed by the singing of the Haitian National Anthem, and that of the United States. Dr. Faure Cox, delegate for Haiti, gave a lecture entitled, tA True 

Baha'i.'                    

 tCOn May 20 the second meeting was opened by the secretary, and one of our friends, Miss R. Hippolyte, gave prayers. Mr. Gerald McBean followed with a lecture on the tLf of the Rib.' At the end of the lecture we read passages from tL~Ere Nou-velk'  on tTrue Civilization,' and the meeting  closed with a prayer. 

 "On May 21 to 25, the meetings were opened as usual with prayers and readings selected from our Baha'i books. On each occasion refreshments were served, and on the last day the Secretary addressed the gathering on the duties of each Baha 'i in his community." 

     In Cuba, the Spiritual     

 Assembly of Havana  secured excellent publicity and sponsored  a most successful meeting in their Baha'i Center on the evening of May 22. Perfecto Perez and Dr. E. Matamoros presented  addresses preliminary to the lecture of Dr. Walter IBlomquist, their guest speaker, whose subject was "La Gesta de Los Mar-tires."  Dr. Blomquist and his wife have since embraced the Faith and are energetically supporting the development of the 

Cause in Cuba.             

 Gwenne Sholtis, pioneer teacher to Tru-jill0, Santo Domingo, provided a colorful description of the joyous celebration in that city. Friends sympathetic to the Faith greeted the event in a spirit of rejoicing. "It was a fiesta of fi~stas," wrote Gwenne, tcfor we were enjoying a threefold celebration, the Centenary of the Bib's Declaration, the birthday of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and the dedication  of the Baha'i House of Worship. 

 What a joyous occasion to share with friends, not only to enrich our own lives in giving, but perhaps striking that vibrant cord which can awaken in each of us that intense desire and longing to serve to the best of our abil —  ity the blessed Faith of God. 

 ttThe guests were from many countries. There were three Hindus, two Puerto Ricans, one Hungarian, six Dominicans, a young lady from Spain and four tNorte Amen-canos.'  The eldest guest was a venerable Dominican, aged seventy-three, and the youngest was a lovely little blonde miss of three and a half years, from Miami, Florida. 

 "The fiesta opened with the Spanish translation of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Prayer For All Nations,' followed by the reading of the Words of the B~b to the eighteen Letters of the Living. 

 An inspiring and stimulating discussion took place about that event. As a conclusion to our commemorative service one of the Hindus chanted, in the Indian language, a beautiful prayer revealed by Lord Krishna. 

 "Very gay and festive were our refreshments and the Kuldi, a ten year old Hindu boy, danced several oriental dances, a Dominican  girl of twelve sang folk songs, and tiny 

Jessie Lee, our Miami      

 guest, also made her contribution to the festive merrymaking. 

 Our program closed with the reading of the cablegram from the National Spiritual Assembly. 

 We had given our guests food for their souls, food for thought, as well as material food. 

 We were, in reality, united with every Baha'i in the world. In reluctant parting, Kuldi, the little Hindu boy, asked: tCan I come to more Baha'i fiestas? I never see anything more pretty.~ 
                           
THE SOUTHERN CONTINENT     
OF AMERICA                 

  The republics of the vast areas of South America also held within their borders a vibrant nucleus of the new civilization. 

 In each of these Baha'i communities the momentous Centenary event was likewise celebrated  in varying degrees of formality or simplicity, and all represented the approach to new achievements in the spiritual destiny of these countries. 
                           
          BRAZIL                     

  It seemed a particularly propitious event that the delegate elected by the Baha'is of Brazil should be a resident, and indeed more than that, a native son of the city of Baha. Twice mentioned by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, Baha, second largest seaport of majestic Brazil,


<p231>
THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH                                 231

  was thus bequeathed an imperishable spiritual legacy. Dr. Fernando Nova, distinguished physician of this city proved a most able representative for his Baha'i coworkers whose needs in the furthering of the teaching work he made known, and whose greetings and suggestions he offered. At home, the Baha'i in Recife and Rio de Janeiro, as well as in Baha, with grateful hearts joined in spiritual unity with their fellow members in the great House of Worship on Lake Michigan and in the other centers of the far-flung world community of Baha'u'llah. 

 Argentina, blessed with the memorial shrine of May Maxwell erected in the beautiful  Quilmes cemetery, paid its tribute to the Baha'i Centenary in a program arranged by the Spiritual Assembly of Buenos Aires at the culmination of several days of well-presented newspaper publicity about the historic occasion of the Centenary anniversary of the Baha'i Faith and of the House of Worship in the heart of North America. 

   MThs Etta Mae Lawrence     

 presided as the chairman, welcoming the guests and explaining  the significance of the event in her introduction to the evening program which was carried out as follows: 

Mr. An-tonek  Kevorkiari   
made the opening address on

"The BTh — The Forerunner    

 of Baha'u'llah";  a reading of the Words of the Bib announcing His Mission, was followed by three addresses, tcBah6.~u~11ib, the Prophet of God for this Day,"by Mr. Salvador 

Tormo, "'Abdu'l-Baha The   
Servant of God," by Mr.    

Athos Costas, "Shoghi      
Effendi, the Guardian      

 of the Cause of God Today, and the Adm%istrative Order," by Mr. Emilio Barros. 

 In vivid contrast to this function of the established community of Buenos Aires was the prayerful vigil of Marcia Steward, pioneer teacher to Chile, in the remote outpost of Punta Arenas, southernmost city of the earth, overlooking part of the Straits of Magellan. 

 Sharing with Alaska the Guardian's  intense longing to see the Faith firmly established in these extremities of the entire American 

Continent, Punta Arenas    

 was being  illumined with the light of the Divine Teachings through Marcia Steward's efforts. It was truly an achievement to celebrate with gratitude and with prayer, that in ten decades, despite every persecution and effort to impede, the Cause had moved on and on until it included even this distant spot. 
                           
         BOLIVIA                    

  Sweeping northward from the fringes of the Antarctic Circle to the mountain peaks of Bolivia, the unity of hearts was linked again in the Cefltenary tribute of the believers  of Santiago, Chile, the first Baha'i Center of that country. With their delegate in Chicago, and their pioneer teacher many hundreds of miles south, engaged in the noble task of hoisting the standard of the Faith in a new and vital section of their country, the celebrants of the Centenary in Santiago partook more of a solemn dedication to their mission of extending the frontiers  still further, than of a spirit of festivity for past victories. 

 In anticipation of the Centennial event, and many months before that that sacred day, the Baha'is of La Paz, Bolivia, centered their attention upon a tribute that would be both of immediate interest and of permanent contribution to the teaching work. 

 Flora Hones, resident pioneer, wrote of their painstaking  preparation of a commemorative booklet of prayers translated into Spanish by Senora Mollie Landivar, carefully selected to bring comfort to young and old, to people of culture and education, and to those whose education had been limited; in short, to offer the healing gift of the Divine Word to all. All obstacles were overcome and the beautiful little booklet was published and generously distributed in their Centenary activities. 

 At the time of the Anniversary itself, an address on the radio was given by talented Matina Lijeron, a short article was published in the local newspaper, and the friends gathered to participate in a program of commemoration. On this occasion prayers and appropriate readings from the Baha Writings paid loving honor to the Declaration  of the Mission of the Mb, and to the birthday of 'Abdu'1 — Baha on that same Holy Day. 

 The program also provided an address entitled, tCThe Great Announcement," by Senora Yvonne de Cuellar, and all who at —  tended shared in the deep reverence and joy Qf the meeting.

         PARAGUAY                   

  Asunci6n, capital city of Paraguay, was largely oblivious to the celebration of the occasion, but within its heart a consecrated l.ittie gathering of Baha'is struggled through storm and wind to commemorate the sacred hour. Meeting in the home of Senora Electra  de Prono, these members of the newiy established Spiritual Assembly of Asunci6n, the first Baha'i Assembly to be founded in that country, were united in a "very high note of love and amity," as they listened to translations given by Senora Josefina Pla de Campos, of prayers and excerpts from the ctDawn~Ereakers.~~

  The program of distinction, grateful testimony  of the Baha'i Community of Lima, Pert, that the Faith had been established in their land, is given below. The last four months of the first century had witnessed the spectacular development from the welcome  to the first believer, in February 1944, to the founding of their Local Assembly on April 21, and further expansion of membership before the Centenary date. The many months of Eve Nicklin's gallant and patient efforts as resident pioneer since 1941 had suddenly blossomed, during a visit of Virginia Orbison, travelling teacher, into this spirited body of believers under whose auspices  the commemoration was carried out. 

 The selfless devotion implicit in all pioneer victories shines forth in the closing phrases of Eve Nicklin's message to the Convention: ~tM the love and unity that is felt here in our little community reach across time and space and unite with that 'ove and unity that must truly be manifest where you are — there in our beloved 

House of Worship." The     

 spirit of essential  steadfastness is reflected in the final sentence of Senora Isabel Tirado de Barreda, first believer to be enrolled in Per6, and the chosen representative to the Convention, m her greeting to that assemblage: tCThus as a drop of water gradually wears away the stone, so must the Baha'i Faith engrave the heart of Humanity so that it may be enabled to attain to God's Grace, of which it is so much in need."

  Unprecedented was the mighty, spiritual chorus of the entire Baha'i world, raising in unison as one voice, a paean of praise and thanksgiving on this Centenary of the glorious Declaration of the Bib; unrecorded, except in the treasuries of God, and in the hearts of those who were privileged to experience  them in the countries of the East and of the West, must remain the many tributes, great and small, of beauty, and of exaltation. Unparalleled the heroism of martyrs and of pioneers that in the span of but one century had served to carry around the world the Message ordained by God, the sacred Lamp of knowledge and of truth that Ctthe Finger of God hath lit."

           THE CENTENARY OF A WORLD FAITH

  u'llAh in several Latin-American countries concluded her Centenary greeting with these thoughts: ttNow are seen the shining threads of the spiritual web woven by Martha Root, later enlarged by Mr. and Mrs. Mathews, Mr. and Mrs. French, and by Frances Stewart and many other travellers and resident pioneers in this agonizing though luminous field; a web gathering strength, and binding gradually and forever, the hearts of the believers  in the Faith of Baha'u'llah; a mystic chain of Baha'i love enormously enlacing more and more hearts — charming them into forming the complete integration of all these races, nations, classes and creeds of this awakening continent. Now is this tone soul' insinuating itself into tmany bodies,' from Magallanes up the mighty Cordillera, spreading itself over the land and the hearts, mounting northward through the Central and uppermost stem of this backbone of the Americas into 

Alaska.                   

 "Exactly one hundred years ago, in Persia, the glorious youthful Bib offered His Silver Cup to the first believer. 

 Now, in every land, the souls are drinking of the Divine Elixir which is changing the heart of the world."

     OF AN ORGANIC COMMUNITY
                           
                  B~ HORACE HOLLEY

  IN accepting the message of Baha'u'llah, every Baha'i has opened his mind and heart to the dominion of certain fundamental truths. 

 These truths he recognizes as divine in origin, beyond human capacity to produce. In the realm of spirit he attests that these truths are revealed evidences of a higher reality than man. They are to the soui what natural law is to physical body of animal or plant. Therefore the believer today, as in the 

Dispensation of Christ     

 or Moses, enters into the condition of faith as a status of relationship to God and not of satisfaction to his own limited human and personal will or awareness. 

 His faith exists as his participation  in a heavenly world. It is the essence of his responsibility and not a temporary compromise effected between his conscience or reason and the meaning of truth, society, virtue, or life. 

 The Baha'i accepts a quality of existence, a level of being which has been created above the control of his own active power. Because on that plane the truth exists that mankind is one, part of his acceptance of the message of Baha'u'llah is capacity to see that truth as existing, as a heavenly reality to be confirmed  on earth. Because likewise on that higher level the inmost being of Moses, Christ, Muhammad, the Bab, and Baha'u'llah is one being, part of the believer's acceptance of the Baha message is capacity to realize the eternal continuance of that oneness, so that thereafter never will he again think of those holy and majestic Prophets according to the separateness of their bodies, their countries and their times. 

 The Baha'i, moreover, recognizes that the realm of truth is inexhaustible, the creator of truth God Himself. 

 Hence the Baha'i can identify truth as the eternal flow of life itself in a channel that deepens and broadens as man's capacity for truth enlarges from age to age. 

 For him, that definition of truth which regards truth as tiny fragments of experience, to be taken up and laid down, as a shopper handling gems on a counter, to buy if one gem happens to please or seems becoming: — such a definition measures man s own knowledge, or interest, or loyalty, but truth is a living unity which no man can condition. 

 It is the sun in the heavens of spiritual reality, while self-will denies its dominion because self-will is the shadow of a cloud. 

 There are times for the revelation of a larger area of the indivisible truth to mankind.  The Manifestation of God signalizes the times and He is the revelation. 

 When He appears on earth He moves and speaks with the power of all truth, known and unknown,  revealed in the past, revealed in Him, 237


<p238>
238              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  or to be revealed in the future. That realm of heavenly reality is brought again in its power and universality to knock at the closed door of human experience, a divine guest whose entrance will bless the household eter —  nally, or a divine punishment when debarred and forbidden and condemned. 

 Baha'u'llah reveals that area of divine truth which underlies all human association. He enlarges man's capacity to receive truth in the realm of experience where all men have condemned themselves to social chaos by ignorance of truth and readiness to substitute  the implacable will of races, classes, nations and creeds for the pure spiritual radiance beneficently shining for all. Spiritual reality today has become the principle of human unity, the law for the nations, the devotion to mankind on which the future civilization can alone repose. As long as men cling to truth as definition, past experience, aspects of self-will, so long must this dire period of chaos continue when the separate fragments of humanity employ life not to unite but to struggle and destroy. 

 m the world of time, Baha'u'llah has created capacity for union and world civilization. 

 His Dispensation is historically new and unique. In the spiritual world it is nothing  else than the ancient and timeless reality of Moses, Jesus and Muhammad disclosed to the race in a stage of added growth and development so that men can take a larger measure of that which always existed. 

 Like the man of faith in former ages, the Baha'i has been given sacred truths to cherish rn his heart as lamps for darkness and medicines  for healing, convictions of immortality and evidences of divine love. 

 But in addition to these gifts, the Baha'i has that bestowal which only the Promised One of all ages could bring: nearness to a process of creation which opens a door of entrance into a world of purified and regenerated human relations. The final element in his recognition of the message of Baha'u'llah is that Baha'u'llah came to found a civilization of unity, progress  and peace. 

 ctO Children of Men! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other. 

 Ponder at all times how ye were created. Since We have created you all from the same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soui, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that from your inmost  being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the essence of detachment may be made manifest. 

 Such is My counsel to you, 0 concourse of light! 

 Heed ye this counsel that ye may obtaiti the fruit of holiness from the sea of wondrous glory." 

 Thus He describes the law of survival revealed for the world today, mystical only in that He addressed these particular words to our deepest inner understanding. Their import is not confined to any subjective realm. The motive and the realization He invokes has become the whole truth of sociOlogy' in this era. 

 Or, as we find its expression in another passage: t'A1I men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization." And the truth reappears in still another form: CCHO vast is the tabernacle of the Cause of God! It bath overshadowed all the peoples and kindreds of the earth, and will, erelong, gather together the whole of mankind  beneath its shelter." 

 The encompassing reach of the Cause of God in each cycle means the particular aspect of experience for which men are held responsible.  Not until our day could there be the creation of the principle of moral cause and effect in terms of mankind itself, in terms of the unifiable world. 

 The mission of 'Abdu'l-Baha, following Baha'u'llah's ascension in 1892, was to raise up a community of believers through whom collectively He might demonstrate the operation of the law of unity. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha's mission became fulfilled historically in the experience of the 

Baha'is of North America. In

 them He developed the administrative order, the organic society, which exemplifies the pattern of justice and order Baha'u'llah had creatively ordained. 

 By His wisdom, His tenderness, His justice and His complete consecration to Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha conveyed to this body of Baha'is a sense of partnership in the process of divine creation: that it is for men to recreate, as civilization, a human and earthly replica of the heavenly order existing in the divine will.


<p239>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 239

  The Baha'i administrative order has been described by the Guardian of the Faith as the pattern of the world order to be gradually  attained as the Faith spreads throughout all countries. Its authority is Baha'u'llah, its sources the teachings He revealed in writing, with the interpretation and amplification made by 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 The first conveyance of authority by Baha'u'llah was to His eldest son. 

 By this conveyance the integrity of the teachings was safeguarded, and the power of action implicit in all true faith directed into channels  of unity for the development of the Cause in its universal aspects. 

 No prior Dispensation has ever raised up an instrument like 'Abdu'l-Baha's through whom the spirit and purpose of the Founder could continue to flow out in its wholeness and purity until His purpose had been achieved. The faith of the Baha'i thus remains untainted by those elements of self-will which in previous ages have translated revealed truth into creeds, rites and institutions of human origin and limited aim. Those who enter the Baha'i community subdue themselves and their personal interests to its sovereign standard, for they are unable to alter the Cause of Baha'u'llah and exploit its teachings or its community for their own advantage. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha's life exemplified the working  of the one spirit and the one truth sustaining  the body of believers throughout the world. 

 He was the light connecting the sun of truth with the earth, the radiance enabling all Baha'is to realize that truth penetrates human affairs, illumines human problems, transcends conventional barriers, changes the climate of life from cold to warm. 

 He infused Himself so completely into the hearts of the Baha'is that they associated  the administrative institutions of the Faith with His trusted and cherished methods of service, so that the contact between their society and their religion has remained continuous  and unimpaired. 

 The second conveyance of authority made by Baha'u'llah was to the institution He termed "House of Justice": — ttThe Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of BaM (i.e., nine) •It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Those souis who arise to serve the Cause sincerely to please God will be inspired by the divine, invisible inspirations. 

 It is incumbent upon all (i.e., all believers) to obey. Administrative affairs are all in charge of the House of Justice; but acts of worship must be observed according as they are revealed in the Book." 

 The House of Justice is limited in its legislative capacity to matters not covered by the teachings of Baha'u'llah Himself: —  cdt is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel together regarding such laws as have not been expressly  revealed in the Book." A high aim is defined for this central administrative organ of the Faiths:~c~The men of the House of Justice must, night and day, gaze toward that which bath been revealed from the horizon of the Supreme Pen for the training of the servants, for the upbuilding of countries, for the preservation of human honor." 

 In creating this institution for His community,  Baha'u'llah made it clear that His Dispensation rests upon continuity of divine purpose, and associates human beings directly  with the operation of His law. The House of Justice, an elective body, transforms  society into an organism reflecting spiritual life. By the just direction of affairs this Faith replaces the institution of the professional  clergy developed in all previous Dispensations. 

 By 1921, when 'Abdu'l-Baha laid down His earthly mission, the American Baha'i community had been extended to scores of cities and acquired power to undertake tasks of considerable magnitude, but the administrative order remained incomplete. 

His Will and Testament     

 inaugurated a new era in the Faith, a further conveyance of authority and a clear exposition of the nature of the elective institutions which the Baha'is were called upon to form. In Shoghi Effendi, 

His


<p240>
240             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  grandson, 'Abdu'l-Baha established the function of Guardianship with sole power to interpret  the teachings and with authority to carry out the provisions of the Will. The Guardianship connects the spiritual and social realms of the Faith in that, in addition to the office of interpreter, he is constituted  the presiding officer of the international  House of Justice when elected; and the Guardianship is made to descend from generation to generation through the male line. 

 From the 'X'ill these excerpts are cited: CcAfter the passing of this wronged one, it is incumbent upon the loved ones of the 'AbM Beauty (i.e., Baha'u'llah) to turn unto Shoghi Effendi — the youthful branch branched from the two hallowed Lote-Trees (i.e., descended from both the B~b and Baha'u'llah) as he is the sign of God, the chosen branch, the guardian of the Cause of God.., 

 unto whom His loved ones must turn. He is the expounder of the words of God and after him will succeed the firstborn  of his lineal descendants. 

 ttThe sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abh4 Beauty. ... Whatsoever they decide is of God. 

 The mighty stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to him who is the guardian of the Cause of God... 

 No doubt every vainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord will not openly declare his evil purposes, nay rather, even as impure gold would he seize upon divers measures and various pretexts that he may separate the gathering of the people of Baha." 

 "Wherefore, 0 my loving friends! Con-sorf  with all the peoples, kindreds and religions  of the world with the utmost truthfulness, uprightness, faithfulness, kindliness, goodwill and friendliness; that all the world of being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of the grace of 

Baha.                       
  ~     ye beloved of the Lord!

 Strive with all your heart to shield the Cause of God from the onslaught of the insincere, for souls such as these cause the straight to become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce contrary results. 

 To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or express his particular convictions. 

 All must seek guidance and turn unto the Center of the Cause and the House of Justice." 

 In each country where Baha'is exist, they participate in the world unity of their Faith through the office of the Guardian at this time, and they maintain local and national Baha'i in4titutions for conducting their own activities. 

 In each local civil community, whether city, township or county, the Baha'is annually  elect nine members to their local Spiritual Assembly. In America the Baha'is of each State or 

Canadian Province, (a      

 direction  of the Guardian having effect for the first time in connection with the Convention  of 1944, the one hundredth year of the Faith) join in the election of delegates by proportionate representation and these delegates, to the full number of one hundred and seventy-one, constitute the Annual Convention  which elects the members of the National 

Spiritual Assembly. These  

 national bodies, in turn, will join in the election of an international Assembly, or House of Justice,  when the world Baha'i community is sufficiently developed. 

 The interrelationship of all these administrative bodies provides the world spirit of the Faith with the agencies required for the maintenance of a constitutional society bat-ancing  the rights of the individual with the paramount principle of unity preserving the whole structure of the Cause. The Baha'i as an individual accepts guidance for his conduct  and doctrinal beliefs, for not otherwise can he contribute his share to the general unity which is God's supreme blessing to the world today. This general unity is the believer's moral environment, his social universe,  his psychic health and his goal of effort transcending any personal aim. In the Baha'i order, the individual is the musical  note, but the teachings revealed by Baha'u'llah are the symphony in which the note finds its real fulfillment; the person attains  value by recognizing that truth transcends his capacity and includes him in a relationship which 'Abdu'l-Baha said endowed the part with the quality of the whole. To receive, we give. In comparison to this divine creation, the traditional claims of in

  dividual conscience, of personal judgment, of private freedom, seem nothing more than empty assertions advanced in opposition to the divine will. It cannot be sufficiently emphasized  that the Baha'is relationship to this new spiritual society is an expression of faith, and faith alone raises personality out of the pit of self-will and moral isolation into which so much of the world has fallen. 

 There can be no organic society, in fact, without social truth and social law embracing  the individual members and evoking a loyalty both voluntary and complete. 

 The political and economic groups which the individual enters with reservations are not true societies but temporary combinations of restless  personalities, met in a truce which can not endure. Baha'u'llah has for ever solved the artificial dilemma which confuses and betrays the ardent upholder of individual freedom by His categorical statement that human freedom consists in obedience to God's law. The freedom revolving around self-will He declares ttmust, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can quench. 

 Know ye that the embodiment of liberty  and its symbol is the animal. True liberty consists in man's submission unto My commandments, little as ye know it." The Guardian, applying the terms of the Will and Testament to an evolving order, has given the present generation of Baha'is a thorough understanding of Baha'i institutions and administrative principles. 

 Rising to its vastly increased responsibility resulting from the loss of the beloved Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Baha'i community itself has intensified  its effort until in America alone the number of believers has been more than doubled since 1921. It has been their destiny to perfect the local and national Baha'i in —  stitutions as models for the believers in other lands. Within the scope of a single lifetime, the American Baha'i community has developed from a small local group to a national  unit of a world society, passing through the successive stages by which a civilization achieves its pristine pattern and severs itself from the anarchy and confusion of the past. 

 In Shoghi EIT endi's letters addressed to this Baha'i community, we have the statement of the form of the administrative order, its function and purpose, its scope and activity, as well as• its significance, which unites the thoughts and inspires the actions of all believers  today. 

 From these letters are selected a number of passages presenting fundamental aspects of the world order initiated by Baha'u'llah. 

 1.  On its nature and scope: —  ~tJ cannot refrain from appealing to them who stand identified with the Faith to disregard the prevailing notions and the fleeting  fashions of the day, and to realize as never before that the exploded theories and the tottering institutions of presentday civilization must needs appear in sharp contrast with those God-given institutions which are destined to arise upon their ruin. 

 ~tFOV Baha'u'llah has not only imbued  mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit. 

 He has not merely enunciated certain  universal principles, or propounded a particular philosophy, however potent, sound and universal these may be. in addition  to these He, as well as 'Abdu'l-Baha after Him, have, unlike the Dispensations of the past, clearly and specifically laid down a set of Laws, established definite institutions,  and provided for the essentials of a Divine Economy. These are destined to be a pattern for future society, a supreme instrument  for the establishment of the Most Great Peace, and the one agency for the unification of the world, and the proclamation of the reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth. 

 (cUnlike the Dispensation of Christ, unlike the Dispensation of Muhammad, unlike all the Dispensations of the past, the apostles of Baha'u'llah in every land, wherever they labor and toil, have before them in clear, in unequivocal and emphatic language, all the laws, the regulations, the principles, the in —  stitutions, the guidance, they require for the prosecution of their task. Therein lies the distinguishing feature of the Baha'i Revelation. 

 Therein Lies the strength of the unity of the Faith, of the validity of a Revelation that claims not to destroy or belittle previous  Revelations, but to connect, unify, and fulfill them. 

 (cFeeble though our Faith may now appear in the eyes of men, who either denounce it as an offshoot of Isl6m, or contemptuously

  ignore it as one more of those obscure sects that abound in the 'West, this priceless gem of Divine Revelation, now still in its embryonic state, shall evolve within the shell of His law, and shall forge ahead, undivided and unimpaired, till it embraces the whole of mankind. Only those who have already recognized the supreme station of Baha'u'llah,  only those whose hearts have been touched by His love, and have become f a —  miliar with the potency of His spirit, can adequately appreciate the value of this Divine Economy — His inestimable gift to mankind. 

     'This Administrative Order

 will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as the nucicus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fulness of time the whole of mankind. 

 (tAlone of all the Revelations gone before it this Faith has succeeded in raising a structure which the bewildered followers of bankrupt and broken creeds might well approach and critically examine, and seek, ere it is too late, the invulnerable security of its world-embracing shelter. 

 "To what else if not to the power and majesty which this Administrative Order —  the rudiments of the future all-enfolding Baha'i Commonwealth — is destined to manifest,  can these utterances of Baha'u'llah allude: The world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new 'World Order. Mankind's ordered life bath been revolutionized  through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed 2.     On its local and national institutions:  —  "A perusal of some of the words of Baha'u'llah  and 'Abdu'l-Baha on the duties and functions of the Spiritual Assemblies in every land (later to be designated as the local Houses of Justice), emphatically reveals the sacredness of their nature, the wide scope of their activity, and the grave responsibility which rests upon them. 

 tAddressing the members of the Spiritual Assembly in Chicago, the Master reveals the following :. — ~Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this prayer with a heart throbbing with the love of God and a tongue purified from all but His remembrance,  that the All-powerful may graciously aid you to achieve supreme victory:~cCO God, my God! We are servants of Thine that have turned with devotion to Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves from all beside Thee in this glorious Day. We have gathered in this spiritual assembly, united in our views and thoughts, with our purposes harmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind.  0 Lord, our God! Make us the signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the Standards of Thy exalted Faith amongst men, servants to Thy mighty Covenant. 

0 Thou our Lord Most High!
Manifestations of Thy     
Divine Unity in Thine     

 Abh~ Kingdom, and resplendent stars shining upon all regions. Lord! Aid us to become seas surging with the billows of Thy wondrous Grace, streams flowing from Thy all-glorious Heights, goodly fruits upon the Tree of Thy heavenly  Cause, trees waving through the breezes of Thy Bounty in Thy celestial Vineyard.  0 God! Make our souls dependent upon the Verses of Thy Divine Unity, our hearts cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace, that we may unite even as the waves of one sea and become merged together as the rays of Thine effulgent Light; that our thoughts, our views, our feelings may become  as one reality, manifesting the spirit of union throughout the world. Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower, the Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 

  "In the Most Holy Book    

 is revealed: —  cThe Lord bath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Baha, and should it exceed this number it does not matter. It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you.


<p243>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                243

  Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, 0 ye that perceive.' 

 c(Furthermore 'Abdu'l-Baha reveals the folIowing: — ~It is incumbent upon every one not to take any step without consulting the Spiritual Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding and be submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well arranged. 

 Otherwise  every person will act independently and after his own judgment, will follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause.' 

 The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance  of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and longsuffering in difficulties  and servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Bali shall be vouchsafed to them. In this day, assemblies of consultation are of the greatest importance and a vital necessity. 

 Obedience unto them is essential and obligatory. 

 The members thereof must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. Should any one oppose, he must on no account  feel hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously,  well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices must prevail.' 

 ~Enumerating the obligations incumbent upon the members of consulting councils, the Beloved reveals the following: — Whe first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of the assembly. 

 They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be non-exist-ent, , that gathering shall be dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught. The second condition: — They must when coming together turn their faces to the Kingdom on high and ask aiX from the Realm of Glory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation  to express their views. They must in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness  and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. The honored members must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion arise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to the majority. It is again not permitted that any one of the honored members object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any decision  arrived at previously, though that decision  be not right, for such criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced. In short, whatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with iove and purity of motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement prevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness. 

 If this be so regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it shall lead to coolness and alienation  that proceed from the Evil One. Discussions must all be confined to spiritual matters that pertain to the training of souis, the instruction of children, the relief of the poor, the help of the feeble throughout all classes in the world, kindness to all peoples, the diffusion of the fragrances of God and the exaltation of His Holy Word. Should they endeavor to fulfill these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become the center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of Spirit.' 

 "So great is the importance and so supreme is the authority of these assemblies that once 'Abdu'l-Baha after having Himself and in His own handwriting corrected the transla-zion made into Arabic of the Ishr~qit (the

244             THE BAHA'I WORLD

Effulgences) by Sheikh     

 Faraj, a Kurdish friend from Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit the above-named translation to the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo, that he may seek from them before publication their approval and consent. 

 These are His very words in that Tablet: — tHis honor, Sheikh Faraju'lIah, has here rendered into Arabic with greatest care the Ishr~q~t and yet I have told him that he must submit his version to the Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned its publication upon the approval of the above-named Assembly. This is so that things may be arranged in an orderly manner, for should it not be so any one may translate a certain Tablet and print and circulate it on his own account. Even a nonbeliever might undertake such work, and thus cause confusion and disorder. 

 If it be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the Spiritual Assembly, a transla tion prepared, printed and circulated by a nonbeliever will have no recognition whatever. 

 "This is indeed a clear indication of the Master's express desire that nothing whatever  should be given to the public by any individual among the friends, unless fully considered and approved by the Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and if this (as is undoubtedly the case) is a matter that pertains  to the general interest of the Cause in that Land, then it is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly to submit it to the consideration and approval of the national body representing all the various local assemblies. Not only with regard to publication, but all matters without any exception whatsoever, regarding the interests of the Cause in that locality, individually or collectively, should be referred exclusively to the Spiritual Assembly in that locality, which shall de

  cide upon it, unless it be a matter of national interest, in which case it shall be referred to the national body. With this national body also will rest the decision whether a given question is of local or national interest. (By national affairs is not meant matters that are political in their character, for the friends of God the world over are strictly forbidden to meddle with political affairs in any way whatever, but rather things that affect the spiritual activities of the body of the friends in that land.) 

 ~tFu11 harmony, however, as well as cooperation among the various local assemblies and the members themselves, and particularly between each assembly and the national body, is of the utmost importance, for upon it depends the unity of the Cause of God, the solidarity of the friends, the full, speedy and efficient working 6f the spiritual activities of His loved ones. 

 "Large issues in such spiritual activities that affect the Cause in general in that land, such as the management of the Star of the West and any periodical which the National  Body may decide to be a Baha'i organ, the matter of publication, of reprinting Baha'i literature and its distribution among the various assemblies, the means whereby the teaching campaign may be stimulated and maintained, the work of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar the racial question in relation to the Cause, the matter of receiving Orientals and association with them, the care and maintenance  of the precious film exhibiting a phase of the Master's sojourn in the United States of America as well as the original matrix and the records of His voice, and various other national spiritual activities, far from being under the exclusive Iurisdic-tion of any local assembly or group of friends, must each be minutely and fully directed by a special board, elected by the National Body, constituted as a committee thereof, responsible to it and upon which the National Body shall exercise constant and general supervision. 

 "Regarding the establishment of 'National Assemblies,' it is of vital importance that in every country, where the conditions are favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a considerable size, such as America, Great Britain and Germany, that a ~Nationa1 Spiritual Assembly' be immediately established, representative of the friends throughout that country. 

 "Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by frequent personal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends as well as the local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the Cause in that country. 

 ttIt serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as in the course of time it shall evolve into the 

National House of Justice  

 (referred to in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will as the td House of Justice'), which according to the explicit text of the Testament will have, in conjunction with the other National Assemblies throughout the Baha world, to elect directly the members of the International House of Justice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the affairs of the Movement throughout the world. 

 "It is expressly recorded in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Writings that these National Assemblies must be indirectly elected by the friends; that is, the friends in every country must elect a certain number of delegates, who in their turn will elect from among all the friends in that country the members of the National 

Spiritual Assembly. In     

 such countries,  therefore, as America, Great Britain and Germany, a fixed number of secondary electors must first be decided upon. The friends then in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine must directly elect its quota of secondary  electors assigned to it in direct proportion to its numerical strength. These secondary electors will then, either through correspondence,  or preferably by gathering together, and first deliberating upon the affairs of the Cause throughout their country (as the delegates to the Convention), elect from among all the friends in that country nine who will be the members of the National Spiritual 

Assembly.                  
 "This National Spiritual   

 Assembly, which, pending the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, will have to be reelected once a year, obviously assumes grave respon


<p246>
246              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  sibilities, for it has to exercise full authority over all the local Assemblies in its province, and will have to direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in general. 

 Vital issues, aifecting the interests of the Cause in that country such as the matter of translation and publication, the Masliri-qu'1-Adhk&r  the Teaching Work, and other similar matters that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly. 

 "It will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local Assemblies, to a special Committee, to be elected by the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that country, which will bear to it the same relation as the local committees bear to their respective local Assemblies. 

 C(lwith it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is strictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the consideration and decision of the local Assembly, or whether it should fall under its own province and be regarded as a matter which ought to receive its special attention. The National Spiritual Assembly will also decide upon such matters which in its opinion should be referred to the Holy Land for consultation and decision. 

 "With these Assemblies, local as well as national, harmoniously, vigorously, and efficiently functioning throughout the Baha'i world, the oniy means for the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have been secured, And when this Supreme Body will have been properly established, it will have to consider afresh the whole situation, and lay down the principle which shall direct,  so long as it deems advisable, the affairs of the Cause. 

 "Th need for the centralization of authority in the National Spiritual Assembly,  and the concentration of power in the various local Assemblies, is made manifest when we reflect that the Cause of Baha'u'llah  is still in its age of tender growth and in a stage of transition; when we remember that the full implications and the exact significance of the Master's worldwide instructions, structions, as laid down in His Will, are as yet not fully grasped, and the whole Movement  has not sufficiently crystallized in the eyes of the world. 

 "It is our primary task to keep the most vigilant eye on the manner and character of its growth, to combat effectively the forces of separation and of sectarian tendencies, lest the Spirit of the Cause be obscured, its unity be threatened, its Teachings suffer corruption; lest extreme orthodoxy on one hand, and irresponsible freedom on the other, cause it to deviate from that Straight Path which alone can lead it to success. 

 'tHitherto the National Convention has been primarily called together for the consideration  of the various circumstances attending  the election of the National Spiritual Assembly. 

 I feel, however, that in view of the expansion and the growing importance of the administrative sphere of the Cause, the general sentiments and tendencies prevailing  among the friends, and the signs of increasing interdependence among the National  Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world, the assembled accredited representatives of the American believers should exercise  not only the vital and responsible right of electing the National Assembly, but should also fulfill the functions of an enlightened,  consultative and cooperative body that will enrich the experience, enhance the prestige, support the authority, and assist the deliberations of the National Spiritual Assembly. 

 It is my firm conviction that it is the bounden duty, in the interest of the Cause we all love and serve, of the members of the incoming National Assembly, once elected by the delegates at Convention time, to seek and have the utmost regard, individually as well as collectively, for the advice, the considered opinion and the true sent-meats  of the assembled delegates. Banishing every vestige of secrecy, of undue reticence, of dictatorial aloofness, from their midst, they should radiantly and abundantly unfold to the eyes of the delegates, by whom they are elected, their plans, their hopes, and their cares, They should familiarize the delegates with the various matters that will have to be considered in the current year, and calmly and conscientiously study and weigh the opinions and judgments of the delegates.


<p247>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                247

  The newly elected National Assembly, during  the few days when the Convention is in session and after the dispersal of the delegates,  should seek ways and means to cultivate understanding, facilitate and maintain the exchange of views, deepen confidence, and vindicate by every tangible evidence their one desire to serve and advance the common weal. Not infrequently,, nay oftentimes,  the most lowly, untutored and inexperienced  among the friends will, by the sheer inspiring force of selfless and ardent devotion, contribute a 4istinct and memorable share to a highly involved discussion in any given Assembly. Great must be the regard paid by those whom the delegates call upon to serve in high position to this all-important though inconspicuous manifestation  of the revealing power of sincere and earnest devotion. 

   "The National Spiritual   

 Assembly, however,  in view of the unavoidable limitations imposed upon the convening of frequent and longstanding sessions of the Convention, will have to retain in its hands the final decision on all matters that affect the interests of the Cause in America, such as the right to decide whether any local Assembly is functioning  in accordance with the principles laid down for the conduct and advancement of the Cause. It is my earnest prayer that they will utilize their highly responsible position, not only for the wise and efficient conduct of the affairs of the Cause, but also for the extension and deepening of the spirit of cordiality and wholehearted and mutual support in their cooperation with the body of their coworkers throughout the land. The seating of delegates to the Convention, i.e., the right to decide upon the validity of the credentials of the delegates at a given Convention, is vested in the outgoing National Assembly, and the right to decide who has the voting privilege is also ultimately placed in the hands of the National Spiritual Assembly, either when a local Spiritual Assembly  is being for the first time formed in a given locality, or when differences arise between a new applicant and an already established local 

Assembly. While the Convention 

 is in session and the accredited delegates have already elected from among the believers throughout the country the mem hers of the National Spiritual Assembly for the current year, it is of infinite value and a supreme necessity that as far as possible all matters requiring immediate decision should be fully and publicly considered, and an endeavor  be made to obtain after mature deliberation,  unanimity in vital decisions. Indeed, it has ever been the cherished desire of our Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha, that the friends in their councils, local as well as national, should by their candor, their honesty of purpose, their singleness of mind, and the thoroughness of their discussions, achieve unanimity in all things. Should this in certain  cases prove impracticable the verdict of the majority should prevail, to which decision the minority must under all circumstances,  gladly, spontaneously and continually, submit. 

 •tNothing short of the all-encompassing, all-pervading power of His Guidance and Love can enable this newly-enfolded order to gather strength and flourish amid the storm and stress of a turbulent age, and in the fulness of time vindicate its high claim to be universally recognized as the one Haven of abiding felicity and peace." 

 3.  On its international institutions: —  (cIt should be stated, at the very outset, in clear and unambiguous language, that these twin institutions of the Administrativc Order of Baha'u'llah should be regarded as divine in origin, essential in their functions and complementary in their aim and purpose. Their common, their fundamental object is to insure the continuity of that divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source of our Faith, to safeguard the unity of its followers and to maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teachings. 

 Acting in conjunction with each other these two inseparable  institutions administer its affairs, coordinate its activities, promote its interests, execute its laws and defend its subsidiary institutions. 

 Severally, each operates within a clearly defined sphere of jurisdiction; each is equipped with its own attendant institutions  — rnstruments designed for the effective discharge of its particular responsibilities and duties. Each exercises, with the limita-dons  imposed upon it, its powers, its authority,  its rights and prerogatives. These are neither contradictory, nor detract in the


<p248>
248              THE BAHA'I WORLD

  slightest degree from the position which each of these institutions occupies. 

 Far from being  incompatible or mutually destructive, they supplement each other's authority and functions, and are permanently and fundamentally  united in their aims. 

 ttDivorced from the institution of the Guardianship the 

World Order of Baha'u'llah 

 would be mutilated and permanently deprived of that hereditary principle which, as 'Abdu'l-Baha has written, has been invariably  upheld by the Law of God. tln all the Divine Dispensations,' 

He states, m a Tablet      

 addressed to a follower of the Faith in Persia, the eldest son hath been given extraordinary distinctions. 

 Even the station of prophethood bath been his birthright.' Without such an institution the integrity of the Faith would be imperilled, and the stability  of the entire fabric would be gravely endangered. 

 Its prestige would suffer, the means required to enable it to take a long, an uninterrupted view over a series of generations would be completely lacking, and the necessary guidance to define the sphere of the legislative action of its elected representatives would be totally withdrawn. 

 "Severed from the no iess essential institution of the Universal House of Justice this same System of the Will of 'Abdu'l-Baha would be paralyzed in its action and would be powerless to fill in those gaps which the Author of the Kitab-i-Aqdas has deliberately left in the body of His legislative and administrative  ordinances. 

 tHe is the Interpreter of the Word of God,' 'Abdu'l-Baha, referring to the functions of the Guardian of the Faith, asserts, using in His Will the very term which He Himself had chosen when refuting the argument  of the Covenant-breakers who had challenged His right to interpret the utterances  of Baha'u'llah. 

 'After him,' He adds, ~ succeed the firstborn of his lineal descendants.' 

 The miglitly stronghold,' He further explains, tshall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to him who is the Grardian of the Cause of God.' 

 tlt is incumbent  upon the members of• the House of Justice, upon all the AglisAn, the AfnAn, the Hands of the Cause of God, to show their obedience, submissiveness and subordination unto the Guardian of the Cause of God.' 

 cc cIt is incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice,' Baha'u'llah, on the other hand, declares in the Eighth Leaf of the 

Exalted Paradise, ~to      

 take counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to them. 

 God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth, and He verily is the Provider, the Omniscient.' 

 tUnto the Most Holy Book' (the Kidb-i-Aqdas), 'Abdu'l-Baha states in His Will, tevery one must turn, and all that i,5 not expressly recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the truth and the purpose  of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth malice, and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant. 

 t~Not only does 'Abdu'l-Baha confirm in His Will Baha'u'llah's above-quoted statement, but invests this body with the additional  right and power to abrogate, according  to the exigencies of time, its own enactments, as well as those of a preceding House of Justice. 

 clnasmuch as the House of Justice,' is His explicit statement in His Will, thath power to enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book and bear upon daily transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same This it can do because these laws form no part of the divine explicit  text.~ 

 "Referring to both the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice we read these emphatic words: tThe sacred and youthful Branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the 

Universal House of Justice 

 to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the AbM Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (the Bab) (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God;' CtFrom these statements it is made indubitably clear and evident that the Guardian  of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings. 
The in


<p249>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH           249

  terpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws and ordinances as Baha'u'llah has not expressly  revealed. Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain  of the other. 

 Neither will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which both have been divinely invested. 

 ttLet no one, while this System is still in its infancy, misconceive its character, belittle its significance or misrepresent its purpose.  The bedrock on which this Administrative Order is founded is God's immutable Purpose for ~nankind in this day. 

 The Source from which it derives its inspiration is no iess than Baha'u'llah Himself. Its shield and defender are the embattled hosts of the AbIA Kingdom. 

 Its seed is the blood of no less than twenty thousand martyrs who have offered up their lives that it may be born and flourish. The axis round which its institutions  revolve are the authentic provisions of the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha.  Its guiding principles are the truths which He Who is the unerring Interpreter of the teachings of our Faith has so clearly enunciated in His public addresses throughout  the West. 

 The laws that govern its operation and limit its functions are those which have been expressly ordained in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. 

 The seat round which its spiritual, its humanitarian and administrative activities will cluster are the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar  and its Dependencies. The pillars that sustain its authority and buttress its structure are the twin institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice. 

 The central, the underlying aim which animates it is the establishment of the New World Order as adumbrated by Baha'u'llah. 

 The methods it employs, the standard it inculcates, incline it to neither East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor poor, neither white nor colored. Its watchword is the unification of the human race; its standard the CMOSt Great Peace'; its consummation the advent of that golden millennium — the Day when the kingdoms  of this world shall have become the Kingdom of God Himself, the Kingdom of Baha'u'llah." 

 Fifty years have passed since the Cause of Baha'u'llah was first brought to North America. Three generations of believers have worked and sacrificed and prayed in order to produce a body of Baha'is large enough to demonstrate the principles here summarized in a few pages for the presentday student of these teachings. What 'Abdu'l-Baha  employed as unifying element for the American community during a period before more than rudimentary local administrative bodies could be established was the construction of the House of Worship, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, in Wilmette. He in fact referred  to the House of Worship as the "inception of the Kingdom." Around its construction devotedly gathered the American friends. 'Abdu'l-Baha approved their action in setting up a religious corporation to hold title to the property and provide a basis for collective action. In surveying those days from 1904 to 1921, one realizes how, in every stage of progress, the believers rushed forward in devotion before they could perceive  the full results of action or comprehend the full unfoldment of their beloved Master's intention. In their hearts they knew that unity is the keynote of their Faith, and they were assured that the new power of unity would augment until it encompassed  the whole of mankind. But as to the nature of world order, the foundation of universal peace, the principles of the future economy, while the clear picture eluded them, they went forward with enthusiasm to the Light. 

 In a continent consecrated to the pioneer, the early American Baha'is pioneered in the world of spirit, striving to participate in a wdrk of supreme importance whose final result was the laying of a foundation on which human society might raise a house of justice and a mansion of peace.

THE WORLI) ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                               251

           A PROCEDURE FOR THE CONDUCT OF
             A LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY

 Adopted by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the  

              United States and Canada

       INTRODUCTION               

  IX     PERUSAL of some of the words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha's on the duties and functions of the Spiritual Assemblies in every land (later to be designated as the local Houses of Justice), emphatically reveals  the sacredness of their nature, the wide scope of their activity, and the grave responsibility which rests upon them." —  SHOGUL EFFENDI, March 5, 1922. 

  "The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counselors to the number of Baha. 

 It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests  of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, 0   ye that perceive." — BAHA'U'LLAH. 

  c~It is incumbent upon every one not to take any step without consulting the Spiritual  Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding and be submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and we11 arranged. Otherwise every person will act independently and after his own judgment, will follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause. 

 ~~The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance  of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrance, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and longsuffering in difficul —  ties and servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Bah4 shall be vouchsafed to them. In this day, Assemblies of consulta-don  are of the greatest importance and a vital necessity. 

 Obedience unto them is essential  and obligatory. 

 The members thereof must take counsci together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. Should any one oppose, he must on no ac —  count feel hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If, after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously, well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise a majority of voices must prevail. 

 "The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of the As —  sembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement and must manifest in themselves  the unity of God, for they are the waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. 

 Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be nonexistent, that gathering shall be dispersed and that Assembly be brought to naught. The second condition: They must when coining together turn their faces to the Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory. They must then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation to express thcir views. They must in every matter search out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden. 

 The honored members must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with moderation set forth the truth, and should


<p252>
252             THE BAHA'I WORLD

 differences of opinion arise a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to the majority. It is again not permitted  that any one of the honored members object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for such criticism would prevent any decision  from being enforced. In short, whatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and purity of motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of estrangement  prevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness. If this be so regarded, that Assembly shall be of God, but otherwise  it shall lead to coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One. Discussions  must all be confined to spiritual matters  that pertain to the training of souls, the instruction of children, the relief of the poor, the help of the feeble throughout all classes in the world, kindness to all peoples, the diffusion of the fragrances of God and the exaltation of His Holy Word. Should they endeavor to fulfill these conditions the grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed  unto them, and that Assembly shall become the center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their aid and they shall day by day receive  a new effusion of Spirit." — 'ABDU'L-BAHA. 

 t~The importance, nay the absolute necessity, of these local Assemblies is manifest when we realize that in the days to come they will evolve into the local House of Justice, and at present provide the firm foundation on which the structure of the Master's Will is to be reared in the future. 

 (Clii order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not fall a prey to conflicting  interpretations, and iose thereby its purity and pristine vigor, that its affairs may be conducted with efficiency and promptness, it is necessary that every one (that is, every member of the Baha'i community) should conscientiously take an active part in the election of these Assemblies, abide by their decision, enforce their decree, and cooperate with them wholeheartedly in their task of stimulating the growth of the Movement throughout all regions. 

 The members of these Assemblies, on their part, must dis regard utterly their own likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and concentrate their minds upon those measures that will conduce to the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i community and promote the common weal."  —  SHOGHI EFFENDI, March 12, 1923. 

 ccLet us recall His explicit and often-repeated  assurance that every Assembly elected in that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness  and detachment is, in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly inspired,  that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and with cheerfulness."

23, 1924.                  
                           
       I.         FUNCTIONS OI~ THE LOCAL
SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY         

  The various functions of the local Spiritual Assembly, and its nature as a constitutional  body, are duly set forth in Article VII of the ByLaws of the National Spiritual Assembly, and are more definitely defined  in the ByLaws of a local Spiritual Assembly approved by the National Spiritual Assembly and recommended by the Guardian.  Each local Spiritual Assembly, and all members of the local Baha'i community, shall be guided and controlled by the provisions  of those ByLaws. 
                           
       II.         MEETINGS OF THE LOCAL
SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY         

  In addition to its observance of the general  functions vested in the institution of a Spiritual Assembly, each Spiritual Assembly has need of a procedure for the conduct of its meetings. 

 The following items represent the outline of the parliamentary rules of procedure which the National Spiritual Assembly  has adopted and recommends to each and every local Spiritual Assembly throughout  the 

United States and Canada.  
                           
   Calling of Meetings        

  A meeting of the Spiritual Assembly is valid oniy when it has been duly called, that is, when each and every member has been informed of the time and place. The general practice is for the Assembly to decide upon some regular time and place for its


<p253>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                          253

 meetings throughout the Baha'i year, and this decision when recorded in the minutes is sufficient notice to the members. 

 When the regular schedule cannot be followed, or the need arises for a special meeting, the secretary, on request by the chairman or any three members of the Spiritual Assembly, should send due notice to all the menThers.

  Report of Treasurer.       
  Report of Committees.      
  Unfinished business.       

 New business, including conferences with members of the community and with applicants for enrollment as members of the community. 

  Closing Prayer.            
                           
   Conduct of Business        

  A Spiritual Assembly, in maintaining its threefold function of a body given (within the limits of its jurisdiction) an executive, a legislative and a judicial capacity, is charged with responsibility for initiating action and making decisions. 

 Its meetings, therefore, revolve around various definite matters which require deliberation and collective  decision, and it is incumbent upon the members, one and all, to address themselves to the sublect under discussion and not engage in general speeches of an irrelevant  character. 

 Every subject or problem before an Assembly  is most efficiently handled when the following process is observed: first, ascertainment and agreement upon the facts; second, agreement upon the spiritual or administrative  Teachings which the question involves; third, full and frank discussion of the matter, leading up to the offering of a resolution; and fourth, voting upon the resolution. 

 A resolution, or motion, is not subject to discussion or vote until duly made and seconded.  It is preferable to have each resolution clear and complete in itself, but when an amendment is duly made and seconded, the chairman shall call for a vote on the amendment first and then on the original motion. An amendment must be relevant to, and not contravene, the subject matter of the motion. 

 The chairman, or other presiding officer, has the same power and responsibility for discussion and voting upon motions as other members of the Assembly. 

 Discussion of any matter before the Assembly  may be terminated by a motion duly made, seconded and voted calling upon the chairman to put the matter to a vote or to proceed to the next matter on the agenda. The purpose of this procedure is to prevent any member or members from prolonging the discussion beyond the point at which full opportunity has been given all members to express their views. 

 When the Assembly has taken action upon any matter, the action is binding upon all members, whether present or absent from the meeting at which the action was taken. Individual views and opinions must be subordinated  to the will of the Assembly when a decision has been made. A Spiritual Assembly is an administrative unit, as it is a spiritual unit, and therefore no distinction between "majority" and t~minority" groups or factions can be recognized. 

 Each member must give undivided loyalty to the institution  to which he or she has been elected. 

 Any action taken by the Assembly can be reconsidered at a later meeting, on motion duly made, seconded and carried. This reconsideration, according to the result of the consultation, may lead to a revision or the annulment of the prior action. If a majority is unwilling to reconsider the prior action, further discussion of the matter by any member is improper. 

 The Assembly has a responsibility in filling  a vacancy caused by the inability of any member to attend the meetings. cdt is oniy too obvious that unless a member can attend regularly the meetings of his local Assembly,


<p254>
254             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  it would be impossible for him to discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfill  his responsibilities as a representative of the community. Membership in a local Spiritual Assembly carries with it, indeed, the obligation and capacity to remain in close touch with local Baha'i activities, and ability to attend regularly the sessions of the Assembly." — SHocu-n EFFENDI, January 27, 1935. 

 The Spiritual Assembly, as a permanent body, is responsible for maintaining all its records, including minutes of meetings, correspondence  and financial records, throughout  its existence as a Baha'i institution. Each officer, therefore, on completing his or her term of office, shall turn over to the Assembly all records pertaining to the busi~ ness of the 

Assembly.                  
                           
HI. CONSULTATION WITH      
THE                        
                           
        COMMUNITY                  

  A.   The institution of the Nineteen Day Feast provides the recognized and regular occasion for general consultation on the part of the community, and for consultation between  the Spiritual Assembly and the members of the community. The conduct of the period of consultation at Nineteen Day Feasts is a vital function of each Spiritual Assembly. 
   From Words of 'Abdu'l-Baha,

'The Nineteen  Day Feast  

 was inaugurated by the Bab and ratified by Baha'u'llah, in His Holy Book, the tAqdas,' so that people may gather together and outwardly show fellowship and love, that the Divine mysteries may be disclosed. 

 The object is concord, that through this fellowship hearts may become perfectly united, and reciprocity and mutual helpfulness  be established. 

 Because the members of the world of humanity are unable to exist without being banded together, cooperation and helpfulness is the basis of human society. Without the realization of these two great principles no great movement is pressed forward."  London, England, December 29, 1912. 

(Quoted in Baha'i News     
No. 33.)                   

 The Nineteen Day Feast     

 has been described  by the Guardian as the foundation of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 It is to be conducted according to the following program: the first part, entirely spiritual in character, is devoted to readings from Baha'i Sacred Writings; the second part consists of general consultation on the affairs of the Cause. 

 The third part is the material feast and social meeting of all the believers, and should maintain the spiritual nature of the Feast. 

 Baha'is should regard this Feast as the very heart of their spiritual activity, their participation in the mystery of the Holy Utterance, their steadfast unity one with another in a universality raised high above the limitations of race, class, nationality, sect, and personality, and their privilege of contributing to the power of the Cause in the realm of collective action.

       The Spiritual Assembly     

 is responsible for the holding of the Nineteen 

Day Feast. If the Baha'i    

 calendar for some adequate reason cannot be observed the Assembly may arrange to hold a Feast at the nearest possible date. 

 Only members of the Baha'i community, and visiting Baha'is from other communities, may attend these meetings, but young people of less than twenty-one years of age, who have studied the Teachings and declared their intention of joining the community  on reaching the age of twenty-one, may also attend. 

 Regular attendance at the Nineteen Day Feast is incumbent upon every Baha'i, illness  or absence from the city being the oniy justification for absence. Believers are expected  to arrange their personal affairs so as to enable them to observe the Baha calendar. 

 Order of Business fur the 

   Consultation Period        

 The chairman or other appointed representative of the Spiritual Assembly presides during the period of consultation.


<p255>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                25$

     The Spiritual Assembly     

 reports to the community whatever communications have been received from the Guardian and the National Spiritual Assembly, and provides opportunity for general discussion. 

 The Assembly likewise reports its own activities and plans, including committee appointments that may have been made since the last Feast, the financial report, arrangements  made for public meetings, and in general  share with the community all matters that concern the Faith. These reports are to be followed by general consultation. 

 A matter of vital importance at this meeting  is consideration of national and international Baha'i affairs, to strengthen the capacity of the community to cooperate in promotion of the larger Baha'i interests and to deepen the understanding of all believers concerning the relation of the local community  to the Baha'i 

World Community.           

 Individual Babh'is are to find in the Nineteen Day Feast the channel through which to make suggestions and recommendations to the National Spiritual Assembly. These recommendations are offered first to the local community, and when adopted by the community come before the local Assembly, which then may in its discretion forward the recommendation to the 

National Spiritual  Assembly

 accompanied by its own considered  view. 

 Provision is to be made for reports from committees, with discussion of each report. Finally, the meeting is to be open for suggestions and recommendations from individual  believers on any matter affecting the Cause. 

 The local Baha'i community may adopt by majority vote any resolution which it wishes collectively to record as its advice and recommendation to the 

Spiritual Assembly.       

 Upon each member of the community lies the obligation to make his or her utmost contribution to the consultation, the ideal being a gathering of Baha'is inspired with one spirit and concentrating upon the one aim to further the interests of the 

Faith.                     

 The Secretary of the Assembly records each resolution adopted by the community, as well as the various suggestions advanced during the meetings, in order to report these to the Spiritual Assembly for its consideration. 

 Whatever action the Assembly takes is to be reported at a later Nineteen Day Feast. 

 Matters of a personal nature should be brought before the Spiritual Assembly and not to the community at the Nineteen 

Day Feast. Concerning      

 the attitude with which believers should come to these Feasts, the Master has said, "You must free yourselves from everything that is in your hearts, be-forc  you enter." (Babd'i News Letter of the N. S. A. of Germany and Austria, December,  1934.) 

 B.   The Annual Meeting on April 21, called for the election of the Spiritual Assembly, provides the occasion for the presentation of annual reports by the Assembly and by all its 

Committees.                

 The chairman of the outgoing Assembly presides at this meeting. 

 The order of business includes: Reading of the call of the meeting, reading of appropriate Baha'i passages bearing upon the subject of the election, appointment of tellers,  distribution of ballots, prayers for the spiritual guidance of the voters, the election, presentation of annual reports, tellers' report of the election, approval of the tellers' report. 

 C.  In addition to these occasions for general consultation, the Spiritual Assembly is to giye consultation to individual believers whenever requested. 

 During such consultation with individual believers, the Assembly should observe the following principles: the impartiality of each of its members with respect to all matters under discussion; the freedom of the individual Baha'i to express his views, feelings and recommendations on any matter affecting the interests of the Cause, the confidential character of this consultation, and the principle that the Spiritual Assembly does not adopt any resolution or make any final decision, until the party or parties have withdrawn from the meeting. 

 Appeals from decisions of a local Spiritual Assembly are provided for in the ByLaws and the procedure fully described in a statement  published in Baha'i News, February, 1933. 

 When confronted with evidences of


<p256>
256            THE BAHA'! WORLD

 unhappiness, whether directed against the Assembly or against members of the community,  the Spiritual Assembly should realize that its relationship to the believers is not merely that of a formal constitutional body but also that of a spiritual institution called upon to manifest the attributes of courtesy, patience and loving insight. Many conditions  are not to be remedied by the exercise of power and authority but rather by a sympathetic understanding of the sources of the difficulty in the hearts of the friends. As 'Abdu'l-Baha has explained, some of the people are children and must be trained, some are ignorant and must be educated, some are sick and must be healed. 

 Where, however, the problem is not of this order but represents flagrant disobedience and disloyalty to the Cause itself, in that case the Assembly should consult with the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 concerning the necessity for disciplinary action. 

 Members of the Baha'i community, for their part, should do their utmost by prayer and meditation to remain always in a positive and joyous spiritual condition, bearing in mind the Tablets which call upon Baha'is to serve the world of humanity and not waste their precious energies in negative complaints.

            THE ANNUAL BAHA'I CONVENTION
   A Statement by the National Spiritual Assembly

 (Approved by the Guardian) DESPITE the repeated explanations given by the Guardian on this subject, there seems to exist each year, prior to and also during the Convention period, some misunderstanding  as to the nature of the Annual 

Meeting.                  

 In order to establish a definite standard of Convention procedure, the following statement  has been approved and adopted, and in accordance with the vote taken by the National Assembly, a copy of the statement is placed in the hands of the presiding officer of the Convention to control the Convention  procedure, after being read to the delegates  by the officer of the National Spiritual Assembly by whom the Convention is convened.' 

  'This reference to t~being read to the delegates" was in connection with the 

1934 Convention only. The 

 statement is here published for the general information of the believers. 

 ttThe delegates present at this Annual Baha'i Convention are called upon to render a unique, a vital service to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Their collective functions and responsibilities are not a matter of arbitrary opinion, but have been clearly described by the Guardian of the Cause. If civil governments  have found it necessary to adopt the doctrine that tignorance of the law. is no excuse,' how much more essential it is for Baha'is, individually and collectively, to base their responsible actions upon thorough comprehension  of the fundamental principles which underlie that Administrative Order which in its maturity is destined to become the 

World Order of Baha'u'llah.

 "Considerable confusion would have been avoided at Conventions held during the past three years had the delegates, and all members  of the National Spiritual Assembly it


<p257>

  self, given sufficient consideration to the fact that Baha'i News of February, 1930, contained an explanation of the Annual Convention which had been prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly, submitted to Shoghi Effendi, and definitely approved by him. It is because this statement of four years ago has gone unnoticed that successive Conventions, acting upon some matters as a law unto themselves, have inadvertently contravened the Guardian's clear instructions. 

 ttThe National Spiritual Assembly now calls attention to two specific portions of the 1930 statement approved by the Guardian which have been neglected in subsequent Conventions: first, the ruling that non-dele-gates  do not possess the right to participate in Convention proceedings; and, second, that the time of the election of members of the National Spiritual Assembly shall be fixed in the Agenda at such a time as to allow the outgoing Assembly full time to report to the delegates, and to allow the incoming Assembly to have full consultation with the assembled delegates. 

 It is surely evident that a procedure or piinciple of action once authorized by the Guardian is not subject to alteration by any Baha'i body or individual believer to whom the procedure directly applies. 

 "In order to remove other sources of misunderstanding, the National Spiritual Assembly  now feels it advisable to point out that the Guardian's letters on the subject of the Convention, received and published in Baha'i News this year,' do not, as some believers  seem to feel, organically change the character and function of the Annual Meeting,  but reaffirm and strengthen instructions and explanations previously given. In the light of all the Guardian's references to this subject, compiled and published by the 

National  Spiritual Assembly

 in Baha'i News of November, 1933 and February, 1934, the following brief summary has been prepared and is now issued with the sole purpose of contributing to the spiritual unity of the chosen delegates here present: —  Ct~ The 

Annual Baha'i Convention    

 has two unique functions to fulfill, discussion of current Baha'i matters and the election 'February, 1934. 

 of the National Spiritual Assembly. The discussion should be free and untrammeled, the election carried on in that spirit of prayer and meditation in which alone every delegate can render obedience to the Guardian's  expressed wish. After the Convention is convened by the Chairman of the National  Spiritual Assembly, and after the roll call is read by the Secretary of the Assembly, the Convention proceeds to the election of its chairman and secretary by secret ballot  and without advance nomination, according  to the standard set for all Baha'i elections. 

 ~     Non-delegates may not participate in Convention discussion. All members of the National Spiritual Assembly may participate in the discussion, but only those members who have been elected delegates may vote on any matter brought up for vote during the proceedings. 

     "3. The outgoing National  

 Spiritual Assembly  is responsible for rendering reports of its own activities arid of those carried on by its committees during the past year. The annual election is to be held at a point midway  during the Convention sessions, so that the incoming Assembly may consult with the delegates. 

 tC4• The Convention is free to discuss any Baha'i matter, in addition to those treated in the annual reports. The Convention is responsible for making its own rules of procedure controlling discussion; for example, concerning any limitations the delegates may find it necessary to impose upon the time allotted to or claimed by any one delegate. The National Assembly will maintain the rights of the delegates to confer freely and fully, free from any restricted pressure, in the exercise of their function. 

 5.     The Convention as an organic body is limited to the actual Convention period. It has no function to discharge after the close of the sessions except that of electing a member or members to fill any vacancy that might arise in the membership of the National Spiritual Assembly during the year. 

 ~     The Convention while in session has no independent legislative, executive or judicial  function. 

 Aside from its action in electing the National Spiritual Assembly, its discussions do not represent actions but

 recommendations which shall, according to the Guardian's instructions, be given conscientious s consideration by the National 

Assembly.

 "7. The National Spiritual Assembly is the supreme Baha'i administrative body within the American Baha'i community, and its jurisdiction n continues without interruption during the Convention period as during thz remainder of the year, and independently of the individuals composing its membership. 

 Any matter requiring action of legislative, executive or judicial nature, whether arising during the Convention period or at any other time, is to be referred to the National Spiritual l Assembly. The National Assembly is responsible for upholding the administrative principles applying to the holding of the Annual l Convention as it is for upholding all other administrative principles. If, therefore, , a Convention departs from the principles s laid down for Conventions by the Guardian, and exceeds the limitations of function conferred upon it, in that case, and in that case alone, the National Spiritual Assembly can and must intervene. It is the National Spiritual Assembly, and not the Convention, which is authorized to decide when and why such intervention is required. 

 "8. The National Spiritual Assembly feels that it owes a real duty to the delegates, and to the entire body of believers, in presenting any and all facts that may be required in order to clarify matters discussed at the Convention. There can be no true Baha'i consultation at this important meeting if any incomplete or erroneous view should prevail. 

 (t9• The National Assembly in adopting and issuing this statement does so in the sincere cere effort to assure the constitutional freedom dom of the Convention to fulfill its high mission. The path of true freedom lies in knowing and obeying the general principles given to all Baha'is for the proper conduct of their collective affairs. 'While the entire world plunges forward to destruction, it is the responsibility of the National Spiritual Assembly to uphold that Order on which peace and security solely depends."

            THE NONPOLITICAL CHARACTER OF
                   THE BAHA'I FAITH

 A Statement Prepared by the National Spiritual Assembly in Response to the Request for Clarification of the Subject Voiced by the 1933 Annual Convention IT is the view of the National Spiritual Assembly  that the Guardian's references to the nonpolitical character of the Baha Faith, when studied as a whole, are so clear that they can be fully grasped by all believers and rightly applied by all Local Spiritual Assemblies to any problems they may encounter.  Should special circumstances arise, however, the National Assembly will make every effort to assist any Local Assembly to arrive at fuller understanding of this important  subject. 

 The first reference to consider is taken from the letter written by 

Shoghi Effendi on March    

 21, 1932, published under the title of "The Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah." 

 tq feel it, therefore, incumbent upon ,me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance  of an instruction which, at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or to the West. 

 And this principle is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents of the Faith of IBah~i'u'11ih, whether in their individual capacities or cot-lectively  as local or national Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 ttLet them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective nations,  with the policies of their governments and the schemes and programs of parties and factions. 

 In such controversies they should assign no blame, take no side, further no design,  and identify themselves with no system prejudicial to the best interests of that worldwide  Fellowship which it is their aim to guard and foster. Let them beware lest they allow themselves to become the tools of  unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious among their countrymen. Let them so shape their lives and regulate their conduct that no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery or of intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought against them. 

 It is their duty to strive to distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts and functions as are either diplomatic or political, from those that are purely administrative in character, and which under  no circumstances are affected by the changes and chances that political activities and party government, in every land, must necessarily involve. Let them affirm their unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God's immutable purpose for all men. 

 CCLCt them proclaim that in whatever country they reside, and however advanced their institutions, or profound their desire to enforce the laws and apply the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, they will, unhesitatingly,  subordinate the operation of such laws and the application of such principles to the requirements and legal enactments of their respective governments. Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances,  the provisions of their country's constitution, much less to ~'l1ow the machinery  of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries." 

 This instruction raised the question whether believers should vote in any public election. A Tablet revealed by 'Abdu'1 —  DaM to Mr. Thornton Chase was sent to


<p260>
260             THE BAnAl WORLD

  the Guardian, and the following reply was received, dated January 26, 1933: ttThe Guardian fully recognizes the authenticity  and controlling influence of this instruction from 'Abdu'l-Baha upon the question. 

 He, however, feels under the responsibility  of stating that the attitude taken by the Master (that is, that American Citizens are in duty bound to vote in public elections) implies certain reservations. 

 He, therefore, lays it upon the individual conscience to see that in following the Master's instructions no Baha'i vote for an officer nor Baha'i participation in the affairs of the Republic shall involve acceptance by that individual of a program or policy that contravenes  any vital principle, spiritual or social, of the Faith." 

 The Guardian added to this letter the following postscript: "I feel it incumbent upon me to clarify the above statement, written in my behalf, by stating that no vote cast, or office undertaken, by a Baha'i should necessarily constitute  acceptance, by the voter or office holder, of the entire program of any political party. No Baha'i can be regarded as either a Republican  or Democrat, as such. He is, above all else, the supporter of the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, with which, I am firmly convinced, the program of no political party is completely harmonious.~~ In a letter dated March 16, 1933, the Guardian sent these further details: "As regards the nonpolitical character of the Baha'i 

Faith, Shoghi Effendi      

 feels that there is no contradiction whatsoever between the Tablet (to Thornton Chase, referred to above) and the reservations to which he has referred. 

 The Master surely never desired the friends to use their influence  towards the realization and promotion of policies contrary to any of the principles of the Faith. The friends may vote, if they can do it, without identifying themselves with one party or another. To enter the arena of party politics is surely detrimental to the best interests of the Faith and will harm the Cause. It remains for the individuals  to so use their right to vote as to keep aloof from party politics, and always bear in mind that they are voting on the merits of the individual, rather than because he belongs to one party or another. The matter must be made perfectly clear to the individuals, who will be left free to exercise their discretion and judgment. But if a cer rain person does enter into party politics and labors for the ascendancy of one party over another, and continues to do it against the expressed appeals, and warnings of the Assembly, then the Assembly has the right to refuse him the right to vote in Baha'i elections." 
                           
         CONCERNING MEMBERSHIP IN NON-BAHA'1
               RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS

  THE instruction written by Shoghi Effendi  concerning membership in non-Eah4'i religious organizations, published in the July, 1935, number of Baha'i News, has brought forth some interesting and important communications from local Spiritual Assemblies and also from individual believers, to all of which the National Spiritual Assembly has given careful and sympathetic attention. 

   The National Assembly      

 itself, on receiving that instruction, made it the subject of extensive consultation, feeling exceedingly responsible for its own understanding of the Guardian's words and anxious to contribute to the understanding of the friends. 

 In October, 1935, the Assembly sent in reply to some of these communications a general letter embodying its thoughts on the sublect, and a copy of that letter was forwarded  to Shoghi Effendi for his approval and comment. His references to its contents,  made in letters addressed to the National  Spiritual 

Assembly on November       

 29 and December 11, 1935, are appended to this statement. 

  Now that Shoghi Effendi's  

 approval has been received, the National Assembly feels it desirable to publish, for the information of ~11 the American believers, the substance of the October letter.

  National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Germany, reinstituted April 7, 1946 at Stuttgart. 

  While so fundamental an instruction is bound to raise different questions corresponding  to the different conditions existing throughout the Baha'i community, the most important consideration is our collective need to grasp the essential principle underlying the new instruction, and our capacity to perceive that the position which the Guardian wishes us to take in regard to church membership is a necessary and inevitable  result of the steady development of the World Order of 

Baha'u'llah.              

 This essential principle is made clear when we turn to Shoghi Effendi's further reference  to the subject as published in Baha'i News for October, 193 5 — words written by the Guardian's own hand. 

 In the light of these words, it seems fully evident that the way to approach this instruction  is in realizing the Faith of Baha'u'llah  as an ever-growing organism des. 

 tined to become something new and greater than any of the revealed religions of the past. 'Whereas former Faiths inspired hearts and illumined souis, they eventuated in forma1 religions with an ecclesiastical organization,  creeds, rituals and churches, while the Faith of Baha'u'llah, likewise renewing man's spiritual life, will gradually produce the institutions of an ordered society, fulfilling  not merely the function of the churches of the past but also the function of the civil state. By this manifestation of the Divine Will in a higher degree than in former ages, humanity will emerge from that immature civilization in which church and state are separate and competitive in-stitptions,  and partake of a true civilization in which spiritual and social principles are at last reconciled as two aspects of one and the same Truth. 

 No Baha'i can read the successive World

  Order letters sent us by Shoghi Effendi without perceiving that the Guardian, for many years, has been preparing us to understand and appreciate this fundamental purpose and mission of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. Even when the Master ascended, we were for the most part still considering the Babi'i Faith as though it were only the "return of Christ" and failing to perceive the entirely new and larger elements latent in the 

Teachings of Baha'u'llah.   

 Thus, in the very first of the World Order  letters, written February 27th, 1929, Shoghi Effendi said: tWho, I may ask, when viewing the international character of the Cause, its far-flung ramifications, the increasing complexity of its affairs, the diversity  of its adherents, and the state of confusion that assails on every tide the infant Faith of God, can for a moment question  the necessity of some sort of adniin-istrative  machinery that will insure, amid the storm and stress of a struggling civilization, the unity of the Faith, the preservation  of its identity, and the protection of its interests?" 

 Although for five years the Guardian had been setting forth the principles of Baha'i Administration in frequent letters, in 1927 he apparently felt it necessary to overcome some doubts here and there as to the validity of the institutions the Master bequeathed to the Baha'is in His Will and Testament. The series of 'World Order letters, however, goes far beyond the point of defending and explaining  their validity as an essential element  in the Faith of Baha'u'llah — the Guardian vastly extended the horizon of our understanding by making it clear that the Administrative Order, in its full development, is to be the social structure of the future civilization. 

 Thus, in that same letter quoted above, he wrote: "Not oniy will the presentday Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future, but will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion  of an independent and Sovereign


<p263>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                263

  Power. And as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the 

Universal House of Justice

 attain the plenitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's future super-state." 

 This passage stands as the keystone in the noble structure which Shoghi Effendi has raised in his function as interpreter of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 The Master developed the Cause to the point where this social Teaching, always existent in the Tablets  of Baha'u'llah, could be explained to the believers and given its due significance as the fulfillment of 

Baha'i evolution. As      

 the Guardian expressed it: "That Divine Civilization, the establishment of which is the primary mission of the Baha'i Faith." (World Order of Baha'u'llah, pp. 34.) 

 For us these words mean that a Baha'i is not merely a member of a revealed Religion, he is also a citizen in a "World Order even though that Order today is still in its infancy  and still obscured by the shadows thrown by the institutions, habits and attitudes derived from the past. 

 But since the aim and end has been made known, our devotion and loyalty must surely express itself, not in clinging to views and thoughts emanating from the past, but in pressing forward in response to the needs of the new creation. 

 That true devotion, which consists in conscious knowledge of the "primary mission,"  and unified action to assist in bringing about its complete triumph, recognizes that a Baha'i today must have singleness of mind as of aim, without the division arising when we stand with one foot in the Cause and one foot in the world, attempting to reconcile diverse elements which the Manifestation of God Himself has declared to be irreconcilable. 

 The principle underlying the Guardian's instruction about membership in non-Balfi'i religious bodies has already been emphasized by Shoghi Effendi in another connection —  the instruction about the nonpolitical character of the Faith which he incorporated in his letter entitled ~The Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah." For example: ttj feel it, therefore, incumbent upon me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance of an instruction which, at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or to the West. And this principle is no other than that which involves  the nonparticipation by the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as local or national Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political  affairs of any particular government." 

 Again, when the question was raised as to membership in certain non-Bahi'i organizations  not directly religious or political in character, the Guardian replied: "Regarding association with the 'World Fellowship of Faiths and kindred Societies, Shoghi Effendi wishes to reaffirm and elucidate the general principle that Baha'i elected representatives as well as individuals should refrain from any act or word that would imply a departure  from the principles, whether spiritual, social or administrative, established by Baha'u'llah. Formal affiliation with and acceptance  of membership in organizations whose programs or policies are not wholly reconcilable with the Teachings is of course out of the question." 
(Baha'i News, August, 1933.)

 Thus, not once but repeatedly the Guardian  has upheld the vital principle underlying every type of relationship between Baha'is and other organizations, namely, that the Cause of Baha'u'llah is an ever-growing organism, and as we begin to realize its universality our responsibility is definitely established to cherish and defend that universality  from all compromise, all admixture with worldly elements, whether emanating from our own habits rooted in the past or from the deliberate attacks imposed by enemies from without. 

 It will be noted that in the instruction published in July, 1935, Baha'i News, the Guardian made it clear that the principle involved is not new and unexpected, but rather an application of an established prin


<p264>
264             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  ciple to a new condition. 

 "Concerning membership in nonBahA'i religious associations, the Guardian wishes to reemphasize the general principle already laid down in his communications to your Assembly and also to the individual believers that no Baha'i who wishes to be a wholehearted and sincere  upholder of the distinguishing principles of the Cause can accept full membership in any non-Bahi'i ecclesiastical organization.  For it is oniy too obvious that in most of its fundamental assumptions the Cause of Baha'u'llah is completely at variance  with outworn creeds, ceremonies and institutions. 

 During the days of the Master the Cause was still in a stage that made such an open and sharp dissociation between it and other religious organizations, and particularly the Muslim Faith, not only inadvisable but practically impossible to establish. 

 But since His passing events throughout the Baha'i world, and particularly in Egypt where the Muslim religious courts have formally testified to the independent  character of the Faith, have developed to a point that has made such an assertion of the independence of the Cause not only highly desirable but absolutely essential." 

 To turn now to the Guardian's words published in October Baha'i News: "The separation that has set in between the institutions  of the Baha'i Faith and the Ishmic ecclesiastical organizations that oppose it imposes upon every loyal upholder of the Cause the obligation refraining from any word or action that might prejudice the position which our enemies have of their own accord proclaimed and established. This historic development, the beginnings of which could neither be recognized nor even anticipated in the years immediately preceding 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, may be said to have signalized the Formative Period of our Faith and to have paved the way for the consolidation of its administrative order. 

 Though our Cause unreservedly recognizes the Divine origin of all the religions  that preceded it and upholds the spiritual truths which lie at their very core and are common to them all, its institutions, whether administrative, religious or humanitarian, must, if their distinctive character is to be maintained and recognized,  be increasingly divorced from the outworn creeds, the meaningless ceremonials and manmade institutions with which these religions are at present identified. Our adversaries  in the East have initiated the struggle. 

 Our future opponents in the West will, in their turn, arise and carry it a stage further. Ours is the duty, in anticipation of this inevitable contest, to uphold unequivocally and with undivided loyalty the integrity of our Faith and demonstrate the distinguishing features of its divinely appointed  institutions.~~ Nothing could be clearer or more emphatic.  These words, asserting again the essential universality of the Cause, likewise repeat and renew the warning that the organized  religions, even in America, will become  bitterly hostile to the Faith of Baha'u'llah, denounce and oppose it, and seek its destruction in vain effort to maintain their own outworn creeds" and material power. Informed of this inevitable development, can a Baha any longer desire to retain a connection which, however liberal and pleasing  it now seems, is a connection with a potential foe of the 

Cause of God? The Guardian's

 instruction signifies that the time has come when all American believers must become fully conscious of the implications of such connections, and carry out their ioy-alty to its logical conclusion. 

 Shoglil Effendi's latest words are not merely an approval of the foregoing statement,  but a most helpful elucidation of some of the problems which arise when the friends turn to their local Assemblies for specific advice under various special circumstances. 

 'tThe explanatory statement in connection  with membership in non-Bahi'i religious organizations is admirably conceive4, convincing and in full conformity with the principles underlying and implied in the unfolding world order of Baha'u'llah." (November 29, 1933.) 

 ttThe Guardian has carefully read the copy of the statement you had recently prepared concerning non-membership in non-Bah&i  religious organizations, and is pleased to realize that your comments and explana

  tions are in full conformity with his views on the subject. He hopes that your letter will serve to clarify this issue in the minds of all the believers, and to further convince them of its vital character and importance in the present stage of the evolution of the Cause. 

 In this case,1 as also in that of suffering believers, the Assemblies, whether local or national, should act tactfully, patiently  and in a friendly and kindly spirit. 

 Knowing how painful and dangerous it is for such believers to repudiate their former allegiances and friendships, they should try to gradually persuade them of the wisdom and necessity of such an action, and instead of thrusting upon them a new principle, to make them accept it inwardly, and out of pure conviction and desire. Too severe and immediate action in such cases is not oniy 'A special case involving an aged believer, afflicted with illness, for whom severance of church relations might have been too great a shock. 

 fruitless but actually harmful. It alienates people instead of winning them to the Cause. 

 "The other point concerns the advisability  of contributing to a church. In this case also the friends must realize that contributions to a church, especially when not regular,  do not necessarily entail affiliation. The believers can make such offerings, occasionally,  and provided they are certain that while doing so they are not connected as members of any church. There should be no confusion between the terms affiliation and association. 'While affiliation with ecclesiastical organizations is not permissible, asso-ciatibn with them should not oniy be nil-erated  but even encouraged. There is no better way to demonstrate the universality of the Cause than this. Baha'u'llah, indeed, urges His followers to consort with all religions and nations with utmost friendliness and love. 

 This constitutes the very spirit of His message to mankind." (December 11, 1935.)

 (The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, page 44.) 

 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who incarnates an institution  for which we can find no parallel whatsoever  in any of the world's recognized religious  systems, may be said to have closed the Age to which He Himself belonged and opened the one in which we are now laboring.  His Will and Testament should thus be regarded as the perpetual, the indissoluble link which the mind of Hun Who is the Mystery of God has conceived in order to insure  the continuity of the three ages that constitute the component parts of the Baha'i Dispensation. 

 The creative energies released by the Law of Baha'u'llah, permeating and evolving within the mind of 'Abdu'l-Baha, have, by their very impact and close interaction, given birth to an Instrument which may be viewed as the Charter of the New World Order which is at once the glory and the promise of this most great Dispensation. 

 The Will may thus be acclaimed as the inevitable

  offspring resulting from that mystic intercourse between Him Who communicated the generating influence of His divine PurpoEc and the One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient. 
Being the Child of the     

Covenant                   

 — the Heir of both the Originator and the Interpreter of the Law of God — the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha can no more be divorced from Him Who supplied the original  and motivating impulse dun from the One Who ultimately conceived it. Baha'u'llah's  inscrutable purpose, we must ever bear in mind, has been so thoroughly infused into the conduct of 'Abdu'l-Baha and their motives have been so closely welded together, that the mere attempt to dissociate the teachings of the former from any system which the ideal Exemplar of those same teachings has established would amount to a repudiation of one of the most sacred and basic truths of the Faith. 

 The Administrative Order, which ever since Abdu'l-Baha's ascension has evolved and is taking shape under our very eyes in no fewer than forty countries of the world, may be considered as the framework of the Will itself, the inviolable stronghold wherein this newborn child is being nurtured and developed. 

 This Administrative Order, as it expands and consolidates itself, will no doubt manifest the potentialities and reveal the Lull implications of this momentous Document —  this most remarkable expression of the 'Will of One of the most remarkable Figures of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah. It will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not oniy as the nucleus but 'the very pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind. — Snoorn 

EFFENDI (The Dispensation  
of Baha'u'llah, pages 5152.)

 The Document establishing that Order, the Charter of a future world civilization, which may be regarded in some of its features  as supplementary to no less weighty a Book than the Kitab-i-Aqdas; signed and sealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha entirdy written with His own hand; its first section composed  during one of the darkest periods of His incarceration in the prison4ortress of 'Akka, proclaims, categorically and unequivocally,  the fundamental beliefs of the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah; reveals, in unmistakable language, the twofold  character of the Mission of the DAb; discloses the. full station of the Author of the Baha'i Revelation; asserts that ~~11 others are servants unto Him and do His bidding"; stresses the importance of the Kitab-i-Aqdas; establishes the institution' of the Guardianship as a hereditary off ce and outlines its essential functions; provides the measures for the election of the International House of Justice, defines its scope and sets forth its relationship to that Institution; prescribes the obligations, and emphasizes the responsibilities, of the Hands of the Cause of God; and extolls the virtues of the indestructible Covenant established by DaM'-u'l1Th.  That Document, furthermore, lauds the courage and constancy of the supporters of Baha'u'llah's Covenant; expatiates on the sufferings endured by its appointed Center; recalls the infamous conduct of Mirza Y4yA and his failure to heed the warnings of the B&b: exposes, in a series of indictments, the perfidy and rebellion of Mirza Muhammad-'Ali, and the complicity of his son Shu'~"u'1Uh and of his brother Mirza Baha'u'llah; reaffirms their excommunication, and predicts the frustration of all their hopes; summons the Afn~n (the ]3~b's kindred), the Hands of the Cause and the entire company of the followers of Baha'u'llah to arise unitedly to propagate His Faith, to disperse far and wide, to labor tirelessly and to follow the heroic example of the Apostles of Jesus Christ; warns them against the dangers of association with the Covenant-breakers, and bids them shield the Cause from the assaults of the insincere and the hypocrite; and counsels them to demonstrate  by their conduct the universality of the Faith they have espoused, and vindicate its high principles. In that same Document its Author reveals the significance and purpose  of the ~uqiiqu'lUh (Right of God), already instituted in the Kitab-i-Aqdas; enjoins  submission and fidelity towards all monarchs who are lust; expresses His longing  for martyrdom, and voices His prayers for the repentance as well as the forgiveness of 

His enemies. (God Passes

270            THE BAHA'I WORLD
 
                   FORMATION OF THE
                 ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER

  OBEDIENT to the summons issued by the Author of so momentous a Document; conscious  of their high calling; galvanized into action by the shock sustained through the unexpected and sudden removal of 'Abdu'l-Baha; guided by the Plan which He, the Architect of the Administrative Order, had entrusted to their hands; undeterred by the attacks directed against it by betrayers and enemies, jealous of its gathering strength and blind to its unique significance, the members of the widely-scattered Baha'i communities, in both the East and the West, arose with clear vision and inflexible determination to inaugurate the Formative Period of their Faith by laying  the foundations of that world-embracing Administrative system designed to evolve into a World Order which posterity must acclaim as the promise and crowning glory of all the Dispensations of the past. Not content with the erection and consolidation of the administrative machinery provided for the preservation of the unity and the efficient conduct of the affairs of a steadily expanding community, the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah resolved, in the course of the two decades following 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, to assert and demonstrate by their acts the independent character of that Faith, to enlarge still further its limits and swell the number of its avowed supporters. 

 In this triple worldwide effort, it should be noted, the r6le played by the American Baha'i community, since the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha until the termination of the first Baha'i century, has been such as to lend a tremendous impetus to the development of the Faith throughout the world, to vindicate the confidence placed in its members by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, and to justify the high praise He bestowed upon them and the fond hopes He entertained for their future. Indeed so preponderating has been the influence of its members in both the initiation and the consolidation of Baha'i admrnis-native  institutions that their country may well deserve to be recognized as the cradle of the Administrative 

Order which Baha'u'llah     

 u'llih Himself had envisaged and which the Will of the 

Center of His Covenant      
had called into being.      

 It should be borne in mind in this connection  that the preliminary steps aiming at the disclosure of the scope and working of this Administrative Order, which was now to be formally established after 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, had already been taken by Him, and even by Baha'u'llah in the years preceding His ascension. 

 The appointment by Him of certain outstanding believers in Persia as "Hands of the Cause"; the initiation of local Assemblies and boards of consultation  by 'Abdu'1 — Bah4 in leading Baha'i centers in both the East and the West; the formation of the Baha'i Temple Unity in the United States of America; the establishment of local funds for the promotion of Baha'i activities; the purchase of property dedicated to the Faith and its future institutions;  the founding of publishing societies for the dissemination of Baha'i literature; the erection of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the Baha world; the construction of the Lb's mausoleum on Mt. Carmel; the institution  of hostels for the accommodation of itinerant teachers and pilgrims — these may be regarded as the precursors of the institutions  which, immediately after the closing of the Heroic Age of the Faith, were to be permanently and systematically established throughout the Baha'i world. 

 No sooner had the provisions of that Divine  Charter, delineating the features of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah been disclosed to His followers than they set about erecting, upon the foundations  which the lives of the heroes, the saints and martyrs of that Faith had laid, the first stage of the framework of its administrative institutions. 

 Conscious of the necessity of constructing, as a first step, a broad and solid base upon which the pillars of that mighty structure could subsequently be raised; fully aware that upon these pillars, when firmly established, the dome, the final unit crowning the entire edifice, must even

  tually rest; undeflected in their course by the crisis which the Covenant-breakers had precipitated  in the Holy Land, or the agitation which the stirrers of mischief had provoked in Egypt, or the disturbances resulting from the seizure by the Shi'ah community of the House of Baha'u'llah in Baglid~d, or the growing dangers confronting the Faith in Russia, or the scorn and ridicule which had greeted the initial activities of the American Baha'i community from certain quarters that had completely misapprehended their purpose,  the pioneer builders of a divinely-con-ceived Order undertook, in complete unison, and despite the great diversity in their outlook,  customs and languages, the double task of establishing and of consolidating their local councils, elected by the rank and file of the believers, and designed to direct, coordinate and extend the activities of the followers  of a far-flung Faith. In Persia, in the United States of America, in the Dominion of Canada, in the British Isles, in France, in Germany, in Austria, in India, in Burma, in Egypt, in 'Jriq, in Russian Tiarkist~n, in the Caucasus, in Australia, in New Zealand, in South Africa, in Turkey, in Syria, in Palestine, in Bulgaria, in Mexico, in the Philippine Islands, in Jamaica, in Costa Rica, in Guatemala, in Honduras, in San Salvador, in Argentina, in Uruguay, in Chile, in Brazil, in Ecuador, in Colombia, in Paraguay, in Peru, in Alaska, in Cuba, in Haiti, in Japan, in the Hawaiian Islands, in Tunisia, in Puerto Rico, in Baliichist4n in Russia, in Transjordan, in Lebanon, and in Abyssinia such councils, constituting the basis of the rising Order of a long-persecuted Faith, were gradually established. 

Designated  as "Spiritual 

 Assemblies" — an appellation that must in the course of time be replaced by their permanent and more descriptive  title of ttHouses of Justice," bestowed  upon them by the Author of the Baha'i Revelation; instituted, without any exception, in every city, town and village where nine or more adult believers are resident;  annually and directly elected, on the first day of the greatest Baha'i Festival by all adult believers, men and women alike; invested with an authority rendering them unanswerable for their acts and decisions to those who elect them; solemnly pledged to foilow, under all conditions, the dictates of the CCMGst Great Justice" that can alone usher in the reign of the "Most Great Peace" which Baha'u'llah has proclaimed and must ultimately establish; charged with the responsibility of promoting at all times the best interests of the communities within their jurisdiction, of familiarizing them with their plans and activities and of inviting them to offer any recommendations they might wish to make; cognizant of their no less vital task of demonstrating, through association with all liberal and humanitarian movements, the universality and comprehensiveness of their Faith; dissociated entirely from all sectarian organizations, whether religious or secular; assisted by committees annually appointed  by, and directly responsible to, them, to each of which a particular branch of Baha'i activity is assigned for study and action; supported by local funds to which all believers voluntarily contribute; these Assemblies, the representatives and custodians of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, numbering, at the present time, several hundred, and whose membership is drawn from the diversified races, creeds and classes constituting the worldwide Baha'i community, have, in the course of the last two decades, abundantly demonstrated, by virtue of their achievements, their right to be regarded as the chief sinews of Baha'i society, as well as the ui-nmate  foundation of its administrative structure. 

 reThe Lord bath ordained," is Baha'u'llah's injunction in His KITAB-I-AQDAS, fethat in every city a House of Justice be established, wherein shall gather counsellors to the nuin-ber  of Baha (9), and should it exceed this number, it doth not matter. It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men, and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together, and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly." feThese Spiritual Assemblies," is 'Abdu'l-Baha's testimony, in a Tablet addressed to an American believer, rrare aided by the Spirit of God. 

 Their defender is 'Abdu'l-Baha. Over them He spreadeth His 

Wings. What


<p272>
272             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  bounty is there greater than this?" erThese Spiritual Assemblies," He, in that same Tablet  has declared, reare shining lamps and heavenly  gardens, from which the fragrances of holiness are diffused over all regions, and the lights of knowledge are shed abroad over all created things. From them the spirit of life streameth in every direction. They, indeed, ~zre the potent sources of the progress of man, at all times and under all conditions." 

 Establishing  beyond any doubt their God-given authority, He has written: Nt is incumbent upon every one not to take any stefi without consulting the Spiritual Assembly, and all must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding, and be sit binissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well arranged."  "1/ after discussion," He, furthermore has written, rea decision be carried unanimously, well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices must prevail." 

 Having established the structure of their local Assemblies — the base of the edifice which the Architect of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah had directed  them to erect — His disciples, in both the East and the West, unhesitatingly embarked  on the next and more difficult stage, of their high enterprise. 

 In countries where the local Baha'i communities had sufficiently advanced in number and in influence, measures  were taken for the initiation of National Assemblies, the pivots round which all national  undertakings must revolve. Designated by 'Abdu'1 — Baha in His Will as the Secondary Hcntses of Justice," they constitute  the electoral bodies in the formation of the International House of Justice, and are empowered to direct, unify, coordinate and stimulate the activities of individuals as well as local Assemblies within their jurisdiction. Resting on the broad base of organized local communities, themselves pillars sustaining the institution which must be regarded as the apex of the Baha'i Administrative 

Order, these Assemblies    

 are elected, according to the principle of proportional representation, by delegates representative of Baha'i local communities  assembled at Convention during the period of the Ri4vTh Festival; are possessed of the necessary authority to enable them to insure the harmonious and efficient development ment of Baha'i activity within their respective spheres; are freed from all direct responsibility for their policies and decisions to their electorates; are charged with the sacred duty of consulting the views, of inviting  the recommendations and of securing the confidence and cooperation of the delegates  and of acquainting them with their plans, problems and actions; and are supported  by the resources of national funds to which all ranks of the faithful are urged to contribute. Instituted in the United States of 

America (1925) (the National Assembly

 superseding in that country the institution of Baha'i Temple Unity formed during 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry), in the British  Isles (1923), in Germany (1923), in Egypt (1924), in 'IrAq (1931), in India (1923), in Persia (1934) and in Australia (1934); their election renewed annually by delegates whose number has been fixed, according to national requirements, at 9, 19, 95, or 171 (9 times 19), these national bodies have through their emergence signalized the birth of a new epoch in the Formative Age of the Faith, and marked a further stage in the evolution, the unification and consolidation  of a continually expanding community. Aided by national committees responsible to and chosen by them, without discrimination, from among the entire body of the believers within their jurisdiction, and to each of which a particular sphere of Baha'i service is allocated, these Baha'i National Assemblies have, as the scope of their activities steadily enlarged, proved themselves, through the spirit of discipline which they have inculcated and through their uncompromising adherence to principles which have enabled them to rise above all prejudices of race, nation, class and color, capable of administering,  in a remarkable fashion, the multiplying  activities of a newly-consolidated Faith. 

 Nor have the national cQmmitrees themselves been less energetic and devoted in the discharge of their respective functions. 

 In the defense of the Faith's vital interests, in the exposition of its doctrine; in the dissemination of its literature; in the consolidation of its finances; in the organization of its teaching force; in the furtherance of the solidarity of its component parts; in the

  purchase of its historic sites; in the preserva-don of its sacred records, treasures and relics; in its contacts with the various institutions of the society of which it forms a part; in the education of its youth; in the training of its children; in the improvement of the status of its women adherents in the East; the members of these diversified agencies, operating under the aegis of the elected national representatives of the Baha'i corn-munity,  have amply demonstrated their capacity  to promote effectively its vital and manifold interests. The mere enumeration of the national committees which, originating  mostly in the West and functioning with exemplary efficiency in the United States and Canada, now carry on their activities with a vigor and a unity of purpose which sharply contrast with the effete institutions of a moribund civilization, would suffice to reveal the scope of these auxiliary institutions which an evolving Administrative Order, still in the secondary stage of its development, has set in motion: The Teaching Committee,  the Regidnal Teaching Committees; the

 The establishment of local and national Assemblies and the subsequent formation of local and national committees, acting as necessary adjuncts to the elected representatives  of Baha'i communities in both the East and the West, however remarkable in themselves, were but a prelude to a series of undertakings on the part of the newly formed National Assemblies, which have contributed in no small measure to the unification  of the Baha'i world community and the consolidation of its Administrative Order.  The initial step taken in that direction was the drafting and adoption of a Baha'i National constitution, first framed and promulgated by the elected representatives of the American Baha'i Community in 1927, the text of which has since, with slight variations  suited to national requirements, been translated into Arabic, German and Persian, and constitutes, at the present time, the charter of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada,  of the British Isles, of Germany, of Persia, of 'Iraq, of India and Burma, of Egypt and the Sudan and of Australia and New Zealand. Heralding the formulation of the constitution of the future Baha'i World Conimunity; submitted for the consideration of all local Assemblies and ratified by the entire body of the recognized believers in countries possessing national Assemblies, this national constitution has been supplemented by a similar document, containing the bylaws of Baha'i local assemblies, first drafted by the New York Baha'i community


<p274>
274             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  in November, 1931, and accepted as a pattern for all local Baha'i constitutions. 

 The text of this national constitution comprises a Declaration of Trust, whose articles set forth the character and objects of the national  Baha'i community, establish the functions,  designate the central office, and describe  the official seal, of the body of its elected representatives, as well as a set of bylaws which define the status, the mode of election, the powers and duties of both local and national Assemblies, describe the relation of the National Assembly to the International House of Justice as well as to local Assemblies and individual believers, outline the rights and obligations of the National Convention and its relation to the National Assembly, disclose the character of Baha'i elections, and lay down the requirements of voting membership in all Baha'i communities. 

 The framing of these constitutions, both local and national, identical to all intents and purposes in their provisions, provided the necessa+y foundation for the legal incorporation  of these administrative institutions in accordance with civil statutes controlling religious or commercial bodies. Giving these Assemblies a legal standing, this incorporation greatly consolidated their power and enlarged their capacity, and in this regard the achievement of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada and the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New York again set an example worthy of emulation by their sister Assemblies in both the East and the West. The incorporation of the American National Spiritual Assembly as a voluntary Trust, a species of corporation recognized under the common law, enabling it to enter into contract, hold property and receive bequests  by virtue of a certificate issued in May, 1929, under the seal of the Department of State in Washington and bearing the signature of the Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, was followed by the adoption of similar legal measures resulting in the successive incorporation of the 

National Spiritual  Assembly

 of the Baha'is of India and Burma, in January, 1933, in Lahore, in the state of Punjab, according to the provisions of the 

Societies Registration     

 Act of 1860; of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Egypt and the Sudan, in December,  1934, as certified by the Mixed Court in Cairo; of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand, in January, 1938, as witnessed by the Deputy Registrar at the General Registry Office for the state of South Australia; and more recently  of the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 of the Baha'is of the British Isles, in August, 1939, as an unlimited nonprofit company, under the Companies Act, 1929, and certified by the Assistant Rdgistrar of Companies  in the City of London. 

 Parallel with the legal incorporation of these 

National Assemblies a      
far larger number  of     

Baha'i local Assemblies    

 were similarly incorporated, following the example set by the Chicago Baha'i Assembly in February, 1932, in countries as far apart as the United States of America, India, Mexico, Germany, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Burma, Costa Rica, Bakchist~n and the Hawaiian Islands. 

The Spiritual Assemblies   

 of the Baha'is of Esslingen in Germany, of Mexico City in Mexico, of San Jos6 in Costa Rica, of Sydney and Adelaide in Australia, of Auckland in New Zealand, of Delhi, Bombay,  Karachi, Poona, Calcutta, Secundera —  bad, Bangalore, Nellore, Ahmedabah, 

Seram-pore,  Andlierie     

 and Baroda in India, of Tuet-ta  in Bakchist&n, of Rangoon, Mandalay and Daidanow-Kalazoo in Burma, of Montreal and Vancouver in Canada, of Honolulu in the Hawaiian Islands, and of Chicago, New York, Washington, D. C., Boston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Kenosha, Teaneck, Racine,  Detroit, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Milwaukee,  Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Winnetka, Phoenix, Columbus, Lima, Portland, Jersey City, Wilmette, Peoria, Seattle, Binghamton, Helena, Richmond Highlands, Miami, Pasadena,  Oakland, Indianapolis, St. Paul, Berke-icy,  Urbana, 

Springfield and Flint      

 in the United States of America — all these succeeded, gradually and after submitting the text of almost identical Baha'i local constitutions to the civil authorities in their respective states or provinces, in constituting themselves into societies and corporations recognized by law, and protected by the civil statutes operating in their respective countries.


<p275>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 275

  Just as the formulation of Baha'i constitutions had provided the foundation for the incorporation of Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies, so did the recognition accorded by local and national authorities to the elected representatives  of Baha'i communities pave the way for the establishment of national and local Baha'i endowments — a historic undertaking  which, as had been the case with previous achievements of far-reaching importance,  the American Baha'i Community was the first to initiate. 

 In most cases these endowments, owing to their religious character,  have been exempted from both government and municipal taxes, as a result of representations made by the incorporated Baha'i bodies to the civil authorities, though the value of the properties thus exempted has, in more than one country, amounted to a considerable sum. 

 In the United States of America the national endowments of the Faith, already representing one and three-quarter million dollars  of assets, and established through a series of Indentures of Trust, created in 1928, 1929, 1935, 1938, 1939, 1941 and 1942 by the 

National Spiritual Assembly

 in that country, acting as Trustees of the American Baha'i Community, now include the land and structure of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and the caretaker's cottage in 'Wilmette, Ill.; the adjoining 

Jjaziratu'1-Quds (Baha'i    
National Headquarters)     

 and itssupplementary administrative  office; the Inn, the Fellowship House, the Baha'i Hall, the Arts and Crafts Studio, a farm, a number of cottages, several parcels of land, including the holding on Monsalvat, blessed by the footsteps of 'Abdu'l-Baha, in Green Acre, in the state of Maine; Bosch House, the Baha'i Hall, a fruit orchard, the Redwood Grove, a dormitory and Ranch Buildings in Geyserville, Calif.; Wilhelm House, Evergreen Cabin, a pine grove and seven lots with buildings at West Englewood, N. J., the scene of the memorable  Unity Feast given by 'Abdu'l-Baha, in June, 1912, to the 

Baha'is of the New York Metropolitan

 district; Wilson House, blessed by His presence, and land in Maiden, Mass.; Mathews 

House and Ranch Buildings  
in Pine Valley, Cob.;      

 land in Muskegon, Mich., and a cemetery lot in Portsmouth, N. H. Of even greater importance, and in their aggregate f at surpassing in value the national endowments of the American Baha'i corn-munity,  though their title-deeds are, owing to the inability of the Persian Baha'i corn-munity to incorporate its national and local assemblies, held in trust by individuals, are the assets which the Faith now possesses in the land of its origin. To the House of the Mb in Shir&z and the ancestral Home of Baha'u'llah in T6tur, M~zindarAn, already in the possession of the community in the days of 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry, have, since His ascension, been added extensive properties,  in the outskirts of the capital, situated on the slopes of Mt. Alburz, overlooking the native city of Baha'u'llah, including a farm, a garden and vineyard, comprising an area of over three million and a half square meters, preserved as the future site of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Persia. Other acquisitions that have greatly extended the range of Baha'i endowments in that country include the House in which Baha'u'llah was born in Tihrin; several buildings adjoining the House of the Bib in Shir~z, including the house owned by His maternal uncle; the Haziratu'1-Quds in Tihr4n; the shop occupied by the BTh during the years He was a merchant in B&shihr; a quarter of the village of Chihriq, where He was confined; the house of Ijiji Mirza. 

 JSni, where He tarried on His way to Tabriz; the public bath used by Him in Shiriz and some adjacent houses; half of the house owned by Val?id in Nayriz and part of the house owned by kluiiat in Zanj An; the three gardens 'jented by Baha'u'llah  in the hamlet of Badasht; the burial-place  of Qudcks in BArfunish; the house of Kalantar in Tihdn, the scene of T&hirih's confinement; the public bath visited by the Bib when in IJriimiyyih, AdhirbAyj An; the house owned by Mirza Husayn — 'Aliy-i-N&, where the B&b's remains had been concealed; the Wibiyyih and the house owned by 

Mulk ~usayn in Masbhad;    

 the residence of the SultAnu'sh-Shuhad& (King of Martyrs) and of the Mahbiibu'sh-ShuhadA (Beloved of Martyrs) in IsftMn, as well as a considerable number of sites and houses, including burial-places,  associated with the heroes and martyrs of the Faith. These holdings which, with very few exceptions, have been recently acquired in Persia, are now being preserved

  and yearly augmented, and, whenever necessary, carefully restored, through the assiduous  efforts of a specially appointed national committee, acting under the constant and general supervision of the elected representatives  of the Persian believers. 

 Nor should mention be omitted of the varied and multiplying national assets which, ever since the inception of the 

Administrative  Order    

 of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, have been steadily acquired in other countries  such as India, Burma, the British Isles, Germany, 'Jriq, Egypt, Australia, 

Trans-jordan  and Syria.  

 Among these may be specially mentioned the Flaziratu'1-Quds of the Baha'is of 'Iraq, the Haziratu'1-Quds of the Baha'is of Egypt, the Haziratu'I-Quds of the Baha'is of India, the Haziratu'1-Quds of the Baha'is of Australia, the Baha'i Home in Esslingen, the Publishing Trust of the Baha'is of the British 

Isles, the Baha'i Pilgrim 

 House in Baghd&d, and the Baha'i Cemeteries established in the capitals of Persia, 

Egypt and Turkistin.      

 Whether in the form of land, schools, administrative headquarters,  secretariats, libraries, cemeteries, hostels or publishing companies, these widely scattered assets, partly registered in the name of incorporated National Assemblies, and partly held in trust by individual recognized believers, have contributed their share to the uninterrupted expansion of national Baha enflowments in recent years as well as to the consolidation of their foundations. 

 Of vital importance, though less notable in significance, have been, moreover, the local endowments which have supplemented the national  assets of the Faith and which, in consequence of the incorporation of Baha'i local Assemblies, have been legally estab-fished  and safeguarded in various countries in both the East and the West. Particularly in Persia these holdings, whether in the form of land, administrative buildings, schools or other institutions, have greatly enriched and widened the scope of the local endowments of the worldwide Baha'i community. 

 Simultaneous with the establishment and incorporation of local and national Baha'i Assemblies, with the formation of their respective  committees, the formulation of national and local Baha'i constitutions and the founding of Baha'i endowments, undertak ings of great institutional significance were initiated by these newly founded Assemblies, among which the institution of the Hazi-ratu'1-Quds  — —  the seat of the Baha'i National Assembly and pivot of all Baha'i administrative  activity in future — must rank as one of the most important. 

 Originating first in Persia, now universally known by its offi —  cial and distinctive title signifying Ctthe Sacred rold," marking a notable advance in the evolution of a process whose beginnings may be traced to the clandestine gatherings held at times underground and in the dead of night, by the persecuted followers of the Faith in that country, this institution, still in the early stages of its development, has already lent its share to the consolidation of the internal functions of the organic Baha'i community, and provided a further visible evidence of its steady growth and rising power. Complementary in its functions  to those of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar —  an edifice exclusively reserved for Baha'i worship — this institution, whether local or national, will, as its component parts, such as the Secretariat, the Treasury, the Archives, the 

Library, the Publishing   
Office, the Assembly     

 Hall, the Council Chamber, the Pilgrims'  Hostel, are brought together and made jointly to operate in one spot, be increasingly regarded as the focus of all Baha'i administrative  activity, and symbolize, in a befitting manner, the ideal of service animating  the Baha'i community in its relation alike to the Faith and to mankind in general. 

   From the Mashriqu'1 — Adhkir

 ordained as a house of worship by Baha'u'llah in the Kinib-i-Aqdas, the representatives of Baha'i communities, both local and national, together with the members of their respective committees, i{rill, as they gather daily within its walls at the hour of dawn, derive the necessary inspiration that will enable them to discharge, in the course of their day-to-day exertions in the Haziratu'1-Quds — the scene of their administrative activities — their duties and responsibilities as befits the chosen stewards of His Faith. 

 Already on the shores of Lake Michigan, in the outskirts of the first Baha center established in the American continent and under the shadow of the first Mashriqu'1-

               BAHA'I RELATIONS WITH
                  CIVIL AUTHORITY

  IN view of recent inquiries on the subject,  the National Spiritual Assembly feels it most desirable at this time for members of the American Baha'i community to main-tim  a common understanding of the principles  which underlie our relations with different departments of the civil government. 

 in dealing with this matter, the Assembly has no intention of adding to procedure or laying down its own regulations but rather of examining the teachings themselves and bringing forth the principles expressed in the writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the advices and directions of the Guardian. 

 We find that from the very beginnings of the American Baha'i community the wise and loving Master counseled the believers to entertain no discussion of political matters in their gatherings. "During the conference no hint must be entertained regarding political affairs. All conferences (i.e., all consultation and discussion) must be regarding the matters of benefit, both as a whole ahd individually, such as the guarding of all in all cases, their protection and preservation, the improvement of character, the training of children, etc. CcJf any person wishes to speak of government affairs, or to interfere with the order of government, the others must not combine with him because the Cause of God is withdrawn  entirely from political affairs; the political realm pertains only to the Rulers of those matters; it has nothing to do with the souL who are exerting their utmost energy to harmonizing affairs, helping character  and inciting (the people) to strive for perfections. 

 Therefore no soul is allowed to interfere with (political) matters, but only in that which is commanded." 

 (BWF, p. 407) t~Let them not introduce any topic in the meeting except the mentioning of the True One, neither must they confuse that merciful  assembly with perplexed outside questions. 

 Make ye an effort that the Lord's Supper may become realized and the heavenly  food descend. 

 This heavenly food is knowledge, understanding, faith, assurance, love, affinity, kindness, purity of purpose, attraction of hearts and the union of souls." (BWF, pp. 407408) The penetrating power of these words continues through the years. They guide and inspire  Baha'i gatherings today as they did when revealed thirtyfive or forty years ago. 'What the Master tells us is a twofold truth: first, the positive definition of the purpose of Baha'i meetings and consultation which confines it to spiritual matters; and second, the inherent limitation implied in the accomplishments of the political realm. 

 The aim of the Faith is to produce the reality of virtue and quality in souis and evolve institutions capable of dealing with social matters justly, in the light of the revealed truths. This is entirely distinct from the province filled by civil institutions. 

 Many years later, in 1932, Shoghi Effendi gave us the message now entitled "The Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah," at a time when our ranks were being swelled with new believers who had not been trained by the Master's Tablets, when the local and National Assemblies were developing power, and the conditions of the Baha'i community had become less simple and primitive, less hidden from the prevailing influences of civilization. In that message he reminded

  Water tower which has been erected to suppiy the National Baha'i Headquarters building, and surrounding gardens, with water, in TihrAn, Persia. 

  us of an instruction deemed very important. ~cAnd this principle is no other than that which involves the nonparticipation by the adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as local or national Assemblies. in any form of activity that might be interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any particular government. 

 Whether it be in the publications which they initiate and supervise; or in their official and public deliberations; or in the posts they occupy and the services they render; or in the communications  they address to their fellow-disciples or in their dealings with men of eminence and authority; or in their affiliations  with kindred societies and organizations, it is, I am firmly convinced, their first and sacred obligation to abstain from any word or deed that might be construed as a violation of this sacred principle. Theirs is the duty to demonstrate, on one hand, their unqualified loyalty and obedience to whatever is the considered judgment of their respective governments. 

 t'Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective nations,  with the policies of their governments and the schemes and programs of parties and factions. 

 Let them affirm their unyielding  determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God's immutable  Purpose for all mankind. 

 tiet them beware lest, in their eagerness to further the aims of their beloved Cause, they should be led unwittingly to bargain with their Faith, to compromise with their essential principles, or to sacrifice, in return for any material advantage which their institutions  may derive, the integrity of their spiritual ideals." ('WOB, pp. 64, 65) The application of this principle has produced a series of explanations by the Guard-tan  and the National Spiritual Assembly, as recorded in "IBah6N Procedure": on the subject of the voting right in civil elections; on the status of believers in relation to military duty, etc. The National Assembly has also felt it advisable to retain the function of contact with the civil government. 

 Now we have another application of the same principle to consider with respect to the right, propriety or usefulness of exerting Baha'i influence for the enactment of certain legislative measures which more or less reflect  the aim of some Baha'i principle or teaching. Should the Baha'i community, local or national, lend the name of the Cause to support legislation, for example, which seeks to abolish race and religious discrimination in matters of industrial employment, or intervene when measures concerning military  training of youth are before a legislature? 

 The National Spiritual     

 Assembly feels that, as a general policy subject to the Guard-tan's  specific direction in special cases, Baha and their administrative institutions should not feel obligated to adopt a ttBahA'i" attitude or course of action on matters of


<p279>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                279

  civil legislation. Our teachings and basic principles speak for themselves. 

 These we can always declare and set forth with all possible energy whenever occasions arise. But a truth which is sundered from its sus-raining  spiritual Source, lifted out of its organic relationship to the Baha community, broken off from the other truths, and made subject to the storm and stress of secular controversy, is no longer a truth with which we can usefully have concern. It has become an enactment to be carried out by institutions and groups committed to other enactments, other aims and purposes and methods not in conformity with the "Divine Polity" entrusted to those alone who give full loyalty to Baha'u'llah. Far better for us to strive to mirror forth radiantly the individual and community virtues of a new era than to hope others than believers will achieve the holy mission of the Faith. 

 We Baha'is have in reality accepted a world order and not merely a new decalogue of truths or commands. 

 On the other hand, obedience to civil government, is an obligation laid by Baha'u'llah upon every Baha'i. 
   tDearly-beloved friends!"  

 the Guardian called out to us as long ago as 1931, ttHu-inanity,  whether viewed in the light of man's individual conduct or in the existing relationships between organized communities and nations, has, alas, strayed too far and suffered too great a decline to be redeemed through the unaided effort of the best among its recognized rulers and statesmen — however  disinterested their motives, however concerted their action, however unsparing in their zeal and devotion to its cause. 

 No scheme which the calculations of the highest  statesmanship may yet devise; no doctrine which the most distinguished exponents of economic theory may hope to advance; no principle which the most ardent of moralists may strive to inculcate, can provide, in the last resort, adequate foundations upon which the future of a distracted world can be built." (WOB, pp. 3 334) Because our hope is firmly founded, our trust complete, our vision clarified, we Baha'is can tread the path of assurance through all the troubles of these days, knowing  that the goal is secure. 
                           
             EXCERPTS FROM THE WRITINGS
                  OF SHOGHI EFFENDI

  J HAVE been acquainted by the perusal of your latest communications with the nature of the doubts that have been publicly expressed,  by one who is wholly misinformed as to the true precepts of the Cause, regarding the validity of institutions that stand inextricably interwoven with the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Not that I for a moment view such faint misgivings in the light of an open challenge to the structure that embodies the Faith, nor is it because I question in the least the unyielding tenacity of the faith of the American believers, if I venture to dwell upon what seems to me appropriate observa-dons  at the present stage of the evolution of our beloved Cause. 

 I am indeed inclined to welcome these expressed apprehensions inasmuch as they afford me an opportunity to familiarize the elected representatives of the believers with the origin and character of the institutions which stand at the very basis of the world order ushered in by Baha'u'llah. We should feel truly thankful for such futile attempts to undermine our beloved Faith —  attempts that protrude their ugly face from time to time, seem for a while able to create a breach in the ranks of the faithful, recede finally into the obscurity of oblivion, and are thought of no more. Such incidents we should regard as the interpositions of Providence, designed to fortify our faith, to clarify our vision, and to deepen our understanding  of the essentials of His 

Divine Revelation.         

 It would, however, be helpful and instructive to bear in mind certain basic principles with reference to the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, which together with the Kitab-i-Aqdas, constitutes the chief depository  wherein are enshrined those priceless elements of that Divine Civilization, the establishment  of which is the primary mission


<p280>
280             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of the Baha'i Faith. A study of the provisions of these sacred documents will reveal the close relationship that exists between them, as well as the identity of purpose and method which they inculcate. Far from regarding their specific provisions as incompatible  and contradictory in spirit, every fair-minded inquirer will readily admit that they are not oniy complementary, but that they mutually confirm one another, and are inseparable parts of one complete Unit. A comparison of their contents with the rest of Baha'i Sacred Writings will similarly establish  the conformity of whatever they contain with the spirit as well as the letter of the authenticated writings and sayings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 In fact, h~ who reads the Aqdas with care and diligence wiii not find it hard to discover that the Most Holy Book JAqdas] 

 itself anticipates in a number of passages the institutions which 'Abdu'l-Baha ordains in His Will. By leaving certain matters unspecified and unregulated  in His 

'Book of Laws [Aqdasj, Baha'u'llah

 seems to have deliberately left a gap in the general scheme of Baha'i Dispensation, which the unequivocal provisions of the Master's Will has filled. To attempt to divorce the one from the other, to insinuate that the Teachings of Baha'u'llah have not been upheld, in their entirety and with absolute integrity, by what 'Abdu'l-Baha has revealed in his Will, is an unpardonable  affront to the unswerving fidelity that has characterized the life and labors of our beloved Master. 

 I will not attempt in the least to assert or demonstrate the authenticity of the Will and Testament of ~ for that in itself would betray an apprehension on my part as to the unanimous confidence of the believers in the genuineness of the last written wishes of our departed Master. 

 I will only confine my observations to those issues which may assist them to appreciate the essential unity that underlies the spiritual, the humanitarian, and the administrative principles enunciated by the Author and the Interpreter  of the Baha'i 

Faith.                     

 I am at a ioss to explain that strange mentality that inclines to uphold as the sole criterion on the truth of the Baha'i Teachings what is admittedly oniy an obscure and un authenticated translation of an oral statement made by 'Abdu'l-Baha, in defiance and total disregard of the available text of all of His universally recognized writings. 

 I truly deplore the unfortunate distortions that have resulted in days past from the incapacity of the interpreter to grasp the meaning of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and from his incompetence to render adequately such truths as have been revealed to him by the Master's statements. Much of the confusion that has obscured the understanding of the believers should be attributed to this double error involved in the inexact rendering of an only partially understood statement. Not infrequently has the interpreter even failed to convey the exact purport of the inquirer's specific questions, and, by his deficiency of understanding and expression in conveying the answer of 'Abdu'l-Baha, has been responsible for reports wholly at variance with the true spirit and purpose of the Cause. It was chiefly in view of this misleading nature of the reports of the informal conversations of 'Abdu'l-Baha with visiting pilgrims, that I have insistently urged the believers of the West to regard such statements as merely personal impressions of the sayings of their Master, and to quote and consider as authentic only such translations as are based upon the authenticated  text of His recorded utterances in the original tongue. 

 It should be remembered by every follower  of the Cause that the system of Baha'i administration is not an innovation imposed arbitrarily upon the Baha'is of the world since the Master's passing, but derives its authority from the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, is specifically prescribed in unnumbered Tablets, and rests in some of its essential features upon the explicit provisions  of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. 

 It thus unifies and correlates the principles separately laid down by Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, and is indissolubly bound with the essential verities of the Faith. To dissociate the administrative  principles of the Cause from the purely spiritual and humanitarian teachings would be tantamount to a mutilation of the body of the Cause, a separation that can only result in the disintegration of its component  parts, and the extinction of the Faith itself.

LOCAL AND NATIONAL HOUSES  
OF JUSTICE                 

  It shoulcf be carefully borne in mind that the local as well as the International Flouses of Justice have been expressly enjoined by the Kitab-i-Aqdas; that the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly, as an intermediary body, and referred to in the Master's Will as the "Secondary House of Justice," has the express sanction of 'Abdu'l-Baha; and that the method to be pursued for the election of the International and National Houses of Justice has been set forth by Him in His W7iil, as well as in a number of His Tablets. Moreover, the institutions of the local and national Funds, that are now the necessary adjuncts to all Local and National Spiritual Assemblies, have not only been established by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets He revealed to the Baha'is of the Orient, but their importance and necessity have been repeatedly emphasized by Him in His utterances  and writings. 

 The concentration of authority in the hands of the elected representatives  of the believers; the necessity of the submission of every adherent of the Faith to the considered judgment of Baha'i Assemblies; His preference for unanimity in decision; the decisive character of the ma-iority vote; and even the desirability for the exercise of close supervision over all Baha'i publications, have been sedulously instilled by 'Abdu'l-Baha, as evidenced by His authenticated and widely-scattered Tablets. 

 To accept His broad and humanitarian Teachings on one hand, and to reject and dismiss with neglectful indifference His more challenging and distinguishing precepts, would be an act of manifest disloyalty to that which He has cherished most in His life. 

   That the Spiritual Assemblies

 of today will be replaced in time by the Houses of Justice, and are to all intents and purposes identical and not separate bodies, is abundantly  confirmed by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself. He has in fact in a Tablet addressed to the members of the first Chicago Spiritual Assembly,  the first elected Baha body instituted  in the United States, referred to them as the members of the cCfl of Justice" for that city, and has thus with His own pen established beyond any doubt the identity of the present Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies with the Houses of Justice referred to by Baha' —  u'llih. For reasons which are not difficult to discover, it has been found advisable to bestow upon the elected representatives of Baha'i communities throughout the world the temporary appellation of Spiritual Assemblies, a term which, as the position and aims of the Baha'i Faith are better understood  and more fully recognized, will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more appropriate designation of House of Justice. Not only will the presentday Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in the future, but will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an independent and 

Sovereign Power. And       

 as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties; and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's future superstate. 

 It must be pointed out, however, in this connection that, contrary to what has been confidently asserted, the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice is in no way dependent upon the adoption of the Baha'i Eaith by the mass of the peoples of the world, nor does it presuppose its acceptance by the majority of the inhabitants of any one country. In fact, 'Abdu'l-Baha, Himself, in one of His earliest Tablets, contemplated the possibility of the formation of the Uni-~ versal House of Justice in His own lifetime, and but for the unfavorable circumstances prevailing under the Turkish r~gime, would have, in all probability, taken the preliminary steps for its establishment. 

 It will be evident, therefore, that given favorable circumstances,  under which the Baha'is of Persia and of the adjoining countries under Soviet Rule may be enabled to elect their national representatives, in accordance with the guiding principles laid down in 'Abdu'1-


<p282>
282             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Baha'is writings, the only remaining obstacle in the way of the definite formation of the International House of Justice will have been removed. For upon the National Houses of Justice of the East and 'West devolves the task, in conformity with the explicit provisions  of the Will, of electing directly the members of the International House of Justice.  Not until they are themselves fully representative of the rank and file of the believers in their respective countries, not until they have acquired the weight and the experience that will enable them to function vigorously in the organic life of the Cause, can they approach their sacred task, and provide  the spiritual basis for the constitution of so august a body in the Baha'i world. 
                           
THE INSTITUTION OF GUARDIANSHIP

  It must be also clearly understood by every believer that the institution of Guardianship does not under any circumstances abrogate, or even in the slightest degree detract from, the powers granted to the Universal House of 

Justice by Baha'u'llah      

 in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and repeatedly and solemnly confirmed  by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will. It does not constitute in any manner a contradiction to the Will and Writings of Baha'u'llah, nor does it nullify any of His revealed instructions. 

 It enhances the prestige of that exalted assembly, stabilizes its supreme position, safeguards its unity, assures the continuity of its labors, without presuming in the slightest to infringe upon the inviolability of its clearly defined sphere of jurisdiction. We stand indeed too close to so monumental a document to claim for ourselves a complete  understanding of all its implications, or to presume to have grasped the manifold mysteries it undoubtedly contains. 

 Only future generations can comprehend the value and the significance attached to this Divine Masterpiece, which the hand of the Master-builder  of the world has designed for the unification and the triumph of the worldwide 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.      

 Only those who come after us will be in a position to realize the value of the surprisingly strong emphasis that has been placed on the institution of the House of Justice and of the Guardianship. 

 They only will appreciate the significance  of the vigorous language employed by 'Abdu'l-Baha with reference to the band of Covenant-breakers that has opposed Him in His days. To them alone will be revealed the suitability of the institutions initiated by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the character of the future society which is to emerge out of the chaos and confusion of the present age.

       INSTITUTIONS               

  And now, it behooves us to refle~t on the animating purpose and the primary functions  of these divinely-established institutions,  the sacred character and the universal efficacy of which can be demonstrated oniy by the spirit they diffuse and the work they actually achieve. 

 I need not dwell upon what I have aLready reiterated and emphasized  that the administration of the Cause is to be conceived as an instrument and not a substitute for the Faith of Baha'u'llah, that it should be regarded as a channel through which His promised blessings may flow, that it should guard against such rigidity as would clog and fetter the liberating forces released by His Revelation Who, I may ask, when viewing the international character of the Cause, its far-flung ramifications,  the increasing complexity of its affairs, the diversity of its adherents, and the state of confusion that assails on every side the infant Faith of God, can for a moment question the necessity of some sort of administrative machinery that will insure, amid the storm ~and stress of a struggling civiliza-non, the unity of the Faith, the preservation of its identity, and the protection of its interests?  To repudiate the validity of the assemblies of the elected ministers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah would be to reject these countless 

Tablets of Baha'u'llah     

 and 'Abdu'l-Baha,  wherein they have extolled their privileges  and duties; emphasized the glory of their mission, revealed the immensity of their task, and warned them of the attacks they must needs expect from the unwisdom of friends, as well as from the malice of their enemies. 

 It is surely for those to whose hands so priceless a heritage has been committed to prayerfully watch lest the tool should supersede the Faith itself, lest undue concern for the minute details arising from the administration of the Cause obscure the

  vision of its promoters, lest partiality, ambition, and worldliness tend in the course of time to becloud the radiance, stain the purity, and impair the effectiveness of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 
February 27, 1929.        

 With the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha the first century of the Baha'i era, whose inception had synchronized with His birth, had run more than three quarters of its course. Sev-enty-seven years previously the light of the Faith proclaimed by the BTh had arisen above the horizon of Shir~z and flashed across the firmament of Persia, dispelling the agelong gloom which had enveloped its peopie. A blood bath of unusual ferocity, in which government, clergy and people, heedless of the significance of that light and blind to its splendor, had jointly participated, had all but extinguished the radiance of its glory in the land of its birth. 

 Baha'u'llah had at the darkest hour in the fortunes of that Faith been summoned, while Himself a prisoner in Tihr~n, to reinvigorate its life, and been commissioned to fulfil its ultimate purpose. 

 In Baghchid, upon the termination of the ten-year delay interposed between the first intimation of that Mission and its Declaration,  He had revealed the Mystery enshrined in the Bib's embryonic Faith, and disclosed the fruit which it had yielded. 

In Adrianople Baha'u'llah's

 Message, the promise of the Bab as well as of all previous Dispensations, had been proclaimed to mankind,  and its challenge voiced to the rulers of the earth in both the East and the West. Behind the walls of the prison-fortress of 'Akka the Bearer of 

God's newborn Revelation 

 had ordained the laws and formulated the principles that were to constitute the warp and woof of His World Order. He had, moreover, prior to His ascension, instituted  the Covenant that was to guide and assist in the laying of its foundations and to safeguard the unity of its builders. 

 Armed with that peerless and potent Instrument, 'Abdu'l-Baha, His eldest Son and Center of His Covenant, had erected the standard of His Father's Faith in the North American continent, and established an impregnable basis for its institutions in 'Western Europe, in the Far East and in Australia. 

 He had, in His works, Tablets and addresses, elucidated  its principles, interpreted its laws, amplified its doctrine, and erected the rudimentary institutions of its future 

Administrative  Order.   

 In Russia He had raised its first House of Worship, whilst on the slopes of Mt. Carmel He had reared a befitting mausoleum for its Herald, and deposited His remains therein with 

His Own hands. Through    

 His visits to several cities in Europe and the North American continent He bad broadcast Baha'u'llah's Message to the peo-pies of the West, and heightened the prestige of the Cause of God to a degree it had never previously experienced. 

 And lastly, in the evening of His life, He had through the revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan issued His mandate to the community which He Himself had raised up, trained and nurtured, a Plan that must in the years to come enable its members to diffuse the light, and erect the administrative fabric, of the Faith throughout the five continents of the globe. 

 The moment had now arrived for that undying,  that world-vitalizing Spirit that was born in Shidtz, that had been rekindled in TihrAn, that had been fanned into flame in Bagfid~id and Adrianople, that had been carried  to the West, and was now illuminating the fringes of five continents, to incarnate itself  in institutions designed to canalize its outspreading energies and stimulate its growth. 

 The Administrative Order  

 which this historic  Document has established, it should be noted, is, by virtue of its origin and character, unique in the annals of the world's religious systems. No Prophet before Baha'u'llah,  it can be confidently asserted, not even Muhammad Whose Book clearly lays down the laws and ordinances of the Islamic Dispensation, has established, authoritatively and in writing, anything comparable to the Administrative Order which the authorized Interpreter of Baha'u'llah's teachings has instituted, an Order which, by virtue of the administrative principles which its Author has formulated, the institutions He has established,  and the right of interpretation with which He has invested its Guardian, must and will, in a manner unparalleled in any previous religion, safeguard from schism the Faith from which it has sprung. Nor is the principle governing its operation similar  to that which underlies any system,


<p284>
284             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  whether theocratic or otherwise, which the minds of men have devised for the government  of human institutions. Neither in theory nor in practice can the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah be said to conform to any type of democratic government, to any system of autocracy, to any purely aristocratic order, or to any of the various theocracies, whether Jewish, Christian or Islamic which mankind has witne~sed in the past. 

 It incorporates within its structure certain elements which are to be found in each of the three recognized forms of secular government, is devoid of the defects which each of them inherently possesses, and blends the salutary truths which each undoubtedly contains without vitiating in any way the integrity of the Divine verities on which it is essentially founded. 

 The hereditary authority which the Guardian of the Administrative Order is called upon to exercise, and the right of the interpretation of the Holy Writ solely conferred upon him; the powers and prerogatives  of the Universal House of Justice, possessing the exclusive right to legislate on matters not explicitly revealed in the Most Holy Book; the ordinance exempting its members from any responsibility to those whom they represent, and from the obligation to conform to their views, convictions or sentiments; the specific provisions requiring  the free and democratic election by the mass of the faithful of the Body that constitutes the sole legislative organ in the worldwide Baha'i community — these are among the features which combine to set apart the Order identified with the Revela-don  of Baha'u'llah from any of the existing systems of human government. 

 Nor have the enemies who, at the hour of the inception of this Administrative Order,  and in the course of its twenty-three year existence, both in the East and in the West, from within and from without, misrepresented its character, or derided and vilified  it, or striven to arrest its march, or contrived to create a breach in the ranks of its supporters, succeeded in achieving their malevolent purpose. The strenuous exertions of an ambitious Armenian, who, in the course of the first years of its establishment  in Egypt, endeavored to supplant it by the "Scientific Society" which in his shortsightedness he had conceived and was sponsoring,  failed utterly in its purpose. 

 The agitation provoked by a deluded woman who strove diligently both in the United States and in England to demonstrate the unau-thenticity of the Charter responsible for its creation, and even to induce the civil authorities  of Palestine to take legal action in the matter — a request which to her great chagrin was curtly refused — as well as the defection of one of the earliest pioneers and founders of the Faith in Germany, whom that same woman had so tragically misled, produced no effect whatsoever. The volumes which a shameless apostate composed and disseminated, during that same period in Persia, in his brazen efforts not oniy to disrupt that Order but to undermine the very Faith which had conceived it, proved similarly abortive. The schemes devised by the remnants  of the Covenant-breakers, who immediately  the aims and purposes of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will became known arose, headed by Mirza Baha'u'llah, to wrest the custodianship of the holiest shrine in the Baha'i world from its appointed Guardian, likewise came to naught and brought further discredit upon them. The subsequent attacks launched by certain exponents of Christian orthodoxy,  in both Christian and non-Christian lands, with the object of subverting the foundations, and distorting the features, of this same Order were powerless to sap the loyalty of its upholders or to deflect them from their high purpose. 

 Not even the infamous and insidious machinations of a former  secretary of 'Abdu'1 — Bah&, who, untaught  by the retribution that befell Baha'u'llah's amanuensis, as well as by the fate that overtook several other secretaries and interpreters of His Master, in both the East and the West, has arisen, and is still exerting himself, to pervert the purpose and nullify the essential provisions of the immortal Document from which that Order derives its authority, have been able to stay even momentarily the march of its institutions along the course set for it by its Author, or to create anything that might, however remotely,  resemble a breach in the ranks of its assured, its wide-awake and stalwart supporters.

                  TO THE CONVENTION

  J ADVISE you to share the following facts with the believers at Convention celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Baha'is have established residence in sev-enty-eight countries, fifty-six of which are sovereign states. Baha'i literature has been translated and published in forty-one languages.  Translations have been undertaken in twelve additional languages. 

 Thirty-one races are represented in the Baha'i world community. 

Five National Assemblies   

 and sixty-one local Assemblies belonging to ten countries are incorporated and legally empowered  to hold property. The Baha'i international  endowments held in the Holy Land are estimated at a half million pounds sterling. 

 National Baha'i endowments in the United States are estimated at one million, seven hundred thousand dollars. 

 The area of land in the Jordan Valley dedicated to the Baha'i Shrines is over five hundred acres. The site purchased for future Baha'i Temple of Persia comprises three and a half million square meters. The cost of the structure of the first Baha'i Temple in the West has been one million, three hundred  thousand dollars. 

 In every state and province of North America IBahA'i Assemblies are functioning. In thirteen hundred localities of the United States and Canada Baha'is reside. 

 Baha'i Centers have been established in every republic  of Latin America, fifteen of which possess 

Spiritual Assemblies.      

 The Faith in the Western Hemisphere now stretches from Anchorage, Alaska, to Magallanes, the world's southernmost city. Sixty-two Centers  have been established in India, twenty-seven with Spiritual Assemblies. 

 Among the historic sites purchased in Persia are the Tihr&n home of Baha'u'llah, the BAt's shop in Bushire, the burial place of Quddfis, part of the village of Chiriq, three gardens in Badasht, and the place where Tihirili was confined. 

 Baha'i administrative headquarters have been founded in Tihrin, Delhi, Cairo, Bat-dad,  Wilmette and Sydney. Baha'i endowments in the Holy Land and the United States have been exempted from taxes by the civil authorities. 

 Civil recognition has been extended to Baha Assemblies in five states of the United States to solemnize Baha'i marriages. 

 I suggest you utilize the above informa-don for publicity purposes wherever advig-able. 

May 9, 1944                

  Hail with glad, grateful heart the historic Assembly of the elected representatives of the followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah throughout the Western Hemisphere participating  in the first All-America Convention gathered in the vicinity of the first Baha'i Center of the Western World beneath the dome of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West to commemorate alike the Anniversary of the founding of the Faith of Baha'u'llah and the Birth of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Anniversary  of its establishment in the Occident and to celebrate the completion of the exterior ornamentation of the most hallowed House of Worship in the entire Baha'i world. I recall with profound emotion on this solemn,  auspicious occasion the milestones in the progress of the community whose rise constitutes one of the noblest episodes in the history of the 

First Baha'i Century. Called

 into being through the operation of the will of the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant,  energized at the hour of its birth by dynamic spirit communicated to it by the band of first returning pilgrims, purged in its infancy by fiery tests involving the defection of its acknowledged founder, nursed through the dispatch of unnumbered

  Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Birmingham, Alabama, incorporated August 24, 1944. 

  Tablets by the vigilant Master, as well as by the successive messengers designed to support  its infant strength, launched upon its rapid career through series of institutional acts and missionary journeys signalizing the first stirrings of its community life, infinitely  enriched by priceless benefits conferred  upon its members in the course of 'Abdu'l-Baha's sojourn in their midst, invested  with a unique mission through the revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, firmly knit through processes proclaiming the emergence of the Divinely appointed Administrative Order, immortalized through the signal acts of its illustrious member who succeeded in winning the allegiance of royalty to its cause, consummating its record of achievements through total victory of the Seven Year Plan thereby sealing the triumph of the first stage in the Mission bestowed by 'Abdu'l-Baha, this repeatedly blessed, much envied community deserves to be acclaimed the Torchbearer of the civilization, the foundations of which the Faith of Baha'u'llah is destined unassailably to establish in the course of the Second Baha'i Century. I am moved to pay a well deserved tribute at this great turning point in the career of so privileged a community to the gallant band of its apostolic founders whose deeds heralded the dawn of the Day of the Covenant in the ~West, to its intrepid pioneers who labored to enlarge the bounds of the Faith in the five continents, to its indefatigable administrators  whose hands reared the fabric of the Administrative Order, to its heroic martyrs who followed in the footsteps of the Dawn-Breakers  of the heroic age, to its itinerant teachers who with written and spoken word pleaded its cause and repulsed the attacks of its adversaries, to its munificent supporters whose liberality accelerated the expansion of its manifold activities, and last but not least to the mass of its stouthearted, self-denying  members whose strenuous, ceaseless, concerted efforts so decisively contributed to the consolidation and broadening of its foundations.  I desire to direct a particular appeal to the Latin American representatives participating in the Centennial Convention to deliberate on measures to reinforce the ties binding them to their Sister Community, unitedly devise means for the inauguration of teaching campaigns in their respective

  Republics, the dissemination of Baha'i literature, the multiplication of Baha'i administrative centers as preliminary steps in the formation of Baha'i National Assemblies, and lend impetus to the prosecution of any enterprise launched to carry still further the Plan conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha for the American 

Baha'i Community.           
May 13, 1944               

  I am overjoyed by the auspicious opening of the Centennial Convention. 

The dearly-beloved  American

 Baha'i community was remembered during the historic night of the glorious Declaration at the ;B~b's Holy Shrine. Announce to the friends the joyful tidings that the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of the Mission of the martyred Herald of the Faith was signalized by historic decision to complete the structure of His sepulcher erected by 'Abdu'l-Baha on the site chosen by Baha'u'llah. The recently designed model of the dome has been unveiled  in the presence of assembled believers. Praying for early removal of obstacles to the consummation of the stupendous Plan conceived by the Founder of the Faith and the hopes cherished by the Center of His 

Covenant.

         TO THE NATIONAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY

  THE one remaining and indeed the most challenging task confronting the 

American Baha'i Community  

 has at long last been brilliantly  accomplished. 

 The structural basis of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah has, through this superb victory, and on the very eve of the worldwide celebrations  of the Centenary of His Faith, been firmly laid by the champion-builders of His World Order in every state of the Great Republic of the West and in every Province of the Dominion of Canada. In each of the Republics of Central and South America, moreover, the banner of His undefeatable Faith has been implanted by the members of that same community, while in no iess than thirteen Republics of Latin America as well as in two Dependencies in the West Indies, Spiritual Assemblies have been established and are already functioning — a feat that has outstdpped the goal originally fixed for the valiant members of that Community in their intercontinental sphere of Baha activity. The exterior ornamentation of the first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West — the culmination of a forty year old enterprise repeatedly  blessed and continually nurtured by 'Abdu'l-Baha has, furthermore, through a remarkable manifestation of the spirit of Baha'i solidarity and self-sacrifice so powerfully  animating the members of that stalwart community, been successfully completed,  more than a year in advance of the time set for its termination. 

 The triple task undertaken with such courage, confidence, zeal and determination — a task which ever since the inception of the Seven Year Plan has challenged and galvanized into action the entire body of the American believers and for the efficient prosecution of which processes of a divinely appointed Administrative Order had, during no less than sixteen years, been steadily evolving — is now finally accomplished and crowned with total victory. 

 The greatest collective enterprise ever launched by the Western followers of Baha'u'llah  and indeed ever undertaken by any Baha'i community in the course of an entire  century, has been gloriously consummated. 

 A victory of undying fame has marked the culmination of the fifty year long labors of the American Baha'i community  in the service of Baha'u'llah and has shed imperishable lustre on the immortal records of His Faith during the first hundred years of its existence. The exploits that have marked the progress of this prodigious, this threefold enterprise, covering a field stretching  from Alaska in the North to the extrem-Thy  of Chile in the South, affecting the destinies  of so great a variety of peoples and nations, involving such a tremendous expenditure of treasure and effort, calling forth so remarkable a spirit of heroism and self-sacrifice,  and undertaken notwithstanding the vicious assaults and incessant machinations  of the breakers of 'Abdu'l-Baha's


<p289>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 289

  Covenant, and despite the perils, the trials and restrictions of a desolating war of unexampled  severity, augur well for the successful prosecution, and indeed assure the ultiffiate victory, of the remaining stages of the Plan conceived, a quarter of a century ago, by 'Abdu'l-Baha for the followers of Baha'u'llah in the North American continent. 

 To the band of pioneers, whether settlers or itinerant teachers, who have forsaken their homes, who have scattered far and wide, who have willingly sacrificed their comfort, their health and even their lives for the prosecution of this Plan; to the several committees  and their auxiliary agencies that have been entrusted with special and direct responsibility for its efficient and orderly development  and who have discharged their high responsibilities with exemplary vigor, courage and fidelity; to the national representatives of the community itself, who have vigilantly and tirelessly supervised, directed and coordinated the unfolding processes of this vast undertaking ever since its inception; to all those who, though not in the forefront of battle, have through their financial  assistance and through the instrumental-fry of their deputies, contributed to the expansion  and consolidation of the Plan, I myself,  as well as the entire Baha'i world, owe a debt of gratitude that no one can measure or describe. To the sacrifices they have made, to the courage they have so consistently shown, to the fidelity they have so remarkably  displayed, to the resourcefulness, the discipline, the constancy and devotion they have so abundantly demonstrated, future generations viewing the magnitude of their labors in their proper perspective, will no doubt pay adequate tribute — a tribute no less ardent and well-deserved than the recognition extended by the piesent-day builders  of the World 

Order of' Baha'u'llah      

 to the Dawn-Breakers, whose shining deeds have signalized the birth of the Heroic 

Age of His Faith.         

 To the elected representatives of all the Baha'i communities of the New World, assembled beneath the Dome of the Mother Temple of the West, on the occasion of the historic, first All-American 

Baha'i Convention  — a Convention

 at which every state and province in the North American continent is represented, in which the representatives of every Republic of Latin America have been invited to participate, whose delegates have been elected, for the first time in American Baha'i history, by all local conununitics already  possessing Assemblies, by all groups and isolated believers throughout the United States and Canada, and whose proceedings will be for ever associated with the celebration of the Centenary of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, of the Hundredth anniversary of the birth of 'Abdu'l-Baha, of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Baha'i Faith in the Western Hemisphere, and of the completion  of the exterior ornamentation of the First Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the West — to all the privileged attendants of such an epochmaking  Convention, I, on my own behalf, as well as in the name of all Baha'i Communities sharing with them, at this great turning point in the history of our Faith, the joys and triumphs of this solemn hour, feel moved to convey the expression of our loving admiration, our joy and our gratitude for the brilliant conclusion of what posterity will no doubt acclaim as one of the most stirring episodes in the history of the Formative  Age of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, as well as one of the most momentous enterprises undertaken during the entire course of the first Century of the Baha'i Era. 

 Haifa, April 15, 1944 The splendid and unique success that has attended the Centenary celebrations so admirably  conducted by the American Baha'i community, has befittingly crowned not only the fifty year record of services rendered by its valiant members, but the labors associated with the entire body of their fel-low-workers in East and West in the course of an entire century. 

 The consummation of the Seven Year Plan, immortalizing the fame of this richly blessed community, set the seal of complete spiritual triumph on these historic celebrations. A memorable chapter in the history of the Faith of 113aM'-u'11&h in the West has been closed. A new


<p290>
290             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  chapter is now opening, a chapter which, eve its termination, must eclipse the most shining  victories won so heroically by those who have so fearlessly launched the first stage of the Great Plan conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha for the 

American believers. The    

 prizes won so painstakingly in both the North and South American continents must be preserved at all costs. A mighty impetus should, at however  great a sacrifice, be lent to the multiplication of Baha'i centers in Latin America, to the expansion of Baha'i literature, to the translation of the Baha'i sacred writings, to the proclamation of the verities of the Faith to the masses, to the strengthening of the bonds binding the newly-fledged communities to each other, and to the deepening of the spiritual life of their members. 

 The task so marvelously initiated in the Latin Republics must be further consolidated ere the prosecutors of the World Plan bequeathed by 'Abdu'l-Baha can embark on further stages, of still greater significance, in their world teaching mission. The cessation of hostilities will open before them fields of service of tremendous fertility and un-dreamed-of magnitude. The advantages and opportunities these fields will offer them cannot  be exploited uniess and until the work to which they have already set their hand in the Western Hemisphere is sufficiently advanced and consolidated. Time is pressing. The new tasks are already beginning to loom on the horizon. 

 The work that still remains to be accomplished ere the next stage is ushered in is still considerable and exacting. I feel confident that the American Baha'i community will, as it has in the past, rise to the occasion and discharge its high duties as befits the unique position it occupies. 

August 18, 1944            

  Comforted, strengthened by assurance of sympathy and loyalty of American believers in the deplorable, delicate situation created by dishonorable alliances made by members of my family, first with Covenant-breakers and now with external enemies of the Faith. 

 The marvelous, rapid, sound evolution of the institutions of the Faith in five continents,  particularly in the Western Hemisphere, constitutes best monition, most effective  counteraction to the detrimental influence of those whose acts proclaim their severance from the Holy Tree and their forfeiture of their sacred birthright. 

 The occasion demands that you direct special attention to passages in "God Passes By" indicating the gravity of the past crises precipitated since the inception of the Faith by kinsmen both of the Manifestation and the Center of His Covenant, demonstrating the pitiful futility of their nefarious activities and the sad fate overtaking defectors and betrayers. 

 The present hour calls for unrelaxing vigilance, continued heroism, redoubled efforts,  renewed dedication by rank and file of the community enjoying preponderating share alike in the erection, the defense, and the consolidation of the worldwide Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah since the passing of the Center of His Covenant. 

 I urge the entire Baha'i community of the Western Hemisphere to focus its attention during the remaining months of the opening year of the second century on the formation  of local Assemblies in the remaining Republics of Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela, Bolivia and San Domingo, guard against dissolution  of Assemblies already painstakingly established throughout the Americas, exert effort on further multiplication of groups, wider dissemination of literature, greater use of radio, closer contact with masses, more audacious proclamation of the Faith, more effective coordination of local and national activities aiming at fuller demonstration of the rights and claims of the Faith to be regarded as sole refuge of humanity in its hour of bitterest agony. 

 The American believers' meritarious activities, individual, local, interstate, intercontinental,  will be the object of my special prayers during the approaching Anniversary of 'Abdu'l-Baha's 

Ascension.                 
November 21, 1944          

  1944, a year memorable for the sharp contrast between the rising tide of spiritual victories culminating in the Centenary celebrations  of a world-embracing Faith and the swiftly ebbing fortunes of a war-ravaged, disillusioned and bankrupt society, is drawing  to a close. 

 In every continent of the


<p291>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 291

  globe; in the Holy Land, the Heart and Center of our Faith and Pivot of its institutions;  in the land of its birth; in the adjoining territory of 'Ir~iq; throughout the Western Hemisphere; in the British Isles, so severely subjected to the violence of a world tempest; throughout the length and breadth of India; in far-off Australasia and in the Nile Valley — all with the soic exception of the distant Republics of the West subjected in varying degrees to the imminent  danger of becoming the theatre of war — the communities laboring for the promotion of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have, throughout five tumultuous years, been providentially  spared to hold aloft its banner, to preserve its integrity, to maintain the continuity of its institutions, to enrich its annals, to consolidate its structure, to further  disseminate its literature and to befittingly  celebrate its centenary. Preponderant indeed has been the share of that privileged community, which has been invested by the Pen of the Center of the Covenant with a worldwide mission, in the prosecution of a task which, ever since the onset of this world upheaval and despite its mounting horrors, the builders of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have so unflaggingly pursued. 

 Neither the participation of the Great Republic of the West in this fierce contest, nor the sorrows, burdens  and restrictions which such direct association with the agonies of a travailing age has entailed have thus far been capable of dimming the splendor of the exploits that have immortalized the record of the services of this community since the ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Indeed, coincident with the period of America's direct participation in this world struggle and in direct  proportion to the turmoil and the tribulations which such a participation has engendered, the members of this community have evinced a heroism and proved themselves  capable of a concerted effort that have eclipsed the notable achievements that have heralded the establishment of the 

Administrative  Order     

 of the Faith as well as the first stage in the development of the 

Seven Year Plan.           

 What the year 1945, on whose threshold we now stand, has in store for the members of this determined, this valiant, this watchful, this exemplary community only the future can reveal. 

 That the trials and ailhic-tions suffered by their country and its peo-pie  must wax as this world upheaval moves towards a climax no one can any longer doubt. 

 The challenge that will face this stalwart community will no doubt be severe. To allow the prizes so nobly won, over so vast a field, at so great a cost, at so critical an hour, to fall into jeopardy would be unworthy of a career so auspiciously initiated, so completely dedicated to the Cause of God, so rich in promise and so brilliant in almost every phase of its evolution.  Every local Assembly, the ordained pivot of a divinely-ordained System, which has been established in the States and Provinces  of the North American continent, as well as in the Republics of Latin America, must, through a supreme effort on the part of pioneers, visiting teachers and Regional Committees, be steadfastly maintained. 

 Simultaneously  a no less determined effort should be exerted to enable the admittedly large number of groups scattered throughout the Americas to attain Assembly status. No less urgent is the obligation to proclaim the verities enshrined in the Faith of RaM'-u'llAh  by every means which individuals, Assemblies  and committees can devise, through the press and radio, through an unprecedented  dissemination of literature, through its systematic translation into Spanish and Portuguese and above all through active association  with leaders of public thought as well as direct contact with the masses of the people. Through such means as these, and through such means only can the members  of the American Baha'i Community, who have so audaciously and successfully launched the first stage of the Divine Plan, be enabled to pave the way and usher in, soon after the cessation of hostilities, the succeeding stage in the evolution of their world mission. 

 My prayers and loving thoughts surround them continually in their devoted labors. 

December 24, 1944          

  The Divine Plan conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha  for the American Baha'i community, in the midst of one of the darkest periods


<p292>
292             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  in human history and with which the destinies  of the followers of Baha'u'llah in the North American continent must for generations to come remain inextricably interwoven,  has, during the concluding years of the first Baha'i Century, triumphantly emerged from the first stage of its evolution.  Its initiation, officially and on a vast scale, had, for well nigh twenty years, been held in abeyance, while the processes of a slowly emerging administrative Order, were, under the unerring guidance of Providence, creating and perfecting the agencies for its efficient and systematic prosecution. 

 The next stage in the evolution of the Plan cannot, however, be embarked upon, until the external causes, hampering its further unfoldment  in other continents of the globe, are removed through the cessation of hostilities and the signal victories already won through its initial development are sufficiently  consolidated throughout the Western Hemisphere. The tasks confronting those who have so valiantly and brilliantly inaugurated the first stage in the execution of the Great Design unfolded by 'Abdu'1 —  BaM for the promulgation of the Faith of His Father, during this transitional period, are manifold, exacting, urgent, and sacred. The local administrative units, so laboriously constituted throughout the Americas, must needs, as already pointed out and repeatedly stressed, be maintained, reinforced, closely integrated and their number steadily multiplied.  The spirit that has inflamed the pioneers  who have set the seal of triumph on the Seven Year Plan, must under the vigilant care of the national representatives of the American Baha'i community be constantly watched, kept alive and nourished. 

 The literature  of the Faith, particularly in Spanish and Portuguese, must be widely disseminated in both Central and South America, as a necessary adjunct to the systematic consolidation of the work that his been undertaken. Above all, the healing Message of Baha'u'llah must during the opening years of the second Baha'i Century, and through the instrumentality of an already properly functioning Administrative Order, whose ramifications have been extended to the four corners of the Western Hemisphere,  be vividly, systematically brought to the attention of the masses, in their hour of grief, misery and confusion. 

 A more audacious assertion of the challenging yen-tics of the Faith; a more convincing presentation of its distinguishing truths; a fuller exposition of the character, the aims and the achievements of its rising Administrative system as the nucleus and pattern of its future world-embracing order; a more direct and intimate contact and• association with the leaders of public thought, whose activities and aims are akin to the teachings of Baha'u'llah, for the purpose of demonstrating the universality, the comprehensiveness,  the liberality and the dynamic power of I-lb Divine Message; a closer scrutiny of the ways and means whereby its claims can be vindicated, its defarners and detractors silenced, and its institutions safeguarded; a more determined effort to exploit, to the fullest extent possible, the talents and abilities of the rank and file of the believers for the purpose of achieving these ends —  these stand out as the paramount tasks summoning  to a challenge, during these years of transition and turmoil, the entire body of the American believers. 

 The facilities which the radio and press furnish must be utilized to a degree unprecedented in American  Baha'i history. 

 The combined resources of the much-envied exemplary American Baha'i community must be harnessed for the effectual promotion of these meritorious purposes. 

 Blessings undreamt of in their scope and plenteousness, are bound to be vouchsafed to those who will, in these dark yet pregnant times, arise to further these noble ends and to hasten through their acts the hour at which a still more momentous stage in the evolution of a Divine and worldwide Plan can be launched. 
     There is no time to lose.  

 The hour is ripe for the proclamation, without fear, without reserve, and without hesitation, and on a scale never as yet undertaken, of the One Message that can alone extricate humanity  from the morass into which it is steadily sinking, and from which they who claim to be the followers of the Most Great Name can and will eventually rescue it. The sooner they who labor for the recognition and triumph of His Faith in the new world arise to carry out these inescapable

  duties, the sooner will the hopes, the aims and objectives of 'Abdu'l-Baha as enshrined in His own Plan, be translated from the realm of vision to the plane of actuality and manifest the full force of the potentialities with which they have been endued. 

March 29, 1945             

  Assure newly-elected members of my fervent prayers for divine gpidance and strength to accomplish the tasks confronting American Baha'i community in the second year of the second Baha'i century. I appeal to National Teaching, Regional and 

Inter-America  Committees  

 to intensify efforts for multiplication of groups and Assemblies the length and breadth of the western hemisphere. 

 An ever-increasing flow of pioneers is indispensable to meet the urgent requirements of the present hour. 

 Renewed, determined, continued exertions by individuals aimed at an unprecedented increase in the number of enrolled believers is vital to the consolidation of activities undertaken by pioneers. 

 Systematic, well-conceived, carefully coordinated plans, nationwide and intercontinental, devised by elected national representatives of the community, are likewise a necessary preliminary to a seed-sowing unexampled both in range and effectiveness in American Baha'i history. 

 The attainment of this threefold objective in 

North, Central and South   

 America will signalize the initiation,  in other continents, of the world mission constituting the sacred birthright of the American followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

Received May 8, 1945       

  The followers of Baha'u'llah throughout five continents unanimously rejoice in the partial emergence of a wartorn humanity from the titanic upheaval unerringly predicted seventy years ago by the Pen of the Author of their Faith. The cessation of hostilities in the European continent signalizes yet another chapter in the tragic tale of fiery trials providentially decreed by inscrutable wisdom designed ultimately to weld the mutually antagonistic elements of human society into a single, organically-united, unshatterable world commonwealth. They gratefully acclaim the signal evidence of the interposition of divine 

Providence

294             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  which during such perilous years enabled the World Center of our Faith to escape what posterity will recognize as one of the gravest dangers which ever confronted the nerve center of its institutions. They are profoundly aware of the bountiful grace vouchsafed by that same Providence insuring, unlike the previous world conflict, uninterrupted intercourse between the spiritual Center and the vast majority of the communities  functioning within the orbit of a far-flung Faith. They are immeasurably thankful for the miraculous preservation of the Indian, Persian, Egyptian, British and 'IrAqi communities, long threatened by dire perils owing to their proximity to the theatre of military operations. 

 They are deeply conscious that the progress achieved, despite six tempestuous years, in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres through the cob lective enterprises launched by these communities outshines the sum total of the accomplishments since the inception of the Formative Age of the 

Faith.                     

 The Seven Year Plan inaugurated by the American Baha'i community under the lowering clouds of the approaching conflict victoriously completed the exterior ornamentation  of the Mother Temple of the West, established the structural basis of the Faith in every State and Province of the North American continent, and hoisted its banner in every Republic of Latin America. The 

Indian believers' Six      

 Year Plan, launched on the eve of hostilities, more than quadrupled the centers functioning within the pale of the 

Administrative Order.      

 The edifices  consecrated to the administrative affairs of an ever-advancing Cause, involving the expenditure of over a hundred thousand dollars, were erected, purchased or completed  in the Capital Cities of India, 'IrAq and Egypt as well as Sydney, Australia. The acquIsition of numerous properties in Baha'u'llah's  native land, on Mount Carmel and in the Jordan Valley, as well as the purchase of several important historic sites associated with the Lives of both the Herald and the Author of the Faith, swelled to an unprecedented  degree our Baha'i endowments. 

 Preliminary steps for the completion of the Bib's Sepulchre and the establishment of the World 

Administrative Center      

 through the removal of the Remains of the Brother and the Mother of 'Abdu'l-Baha were undertaken.  The termination of the First Century of the Baha'i Era, synchronizing with the climax of the raging storm, was publicly and befittingly celebrated, despite the multiplication of restrictions. Above all, the unity and integrity of an incorruptible world community was consistently safeguarded  in face of the insidious opposition of avowed enemies without and the Cove-nant-breakers within. 

 Such splendid victories, over so vast a field, amidst such tribulations during so prolonged an ordeal, augur well for the colossal tasks destined to be accomplished during the course of the peaceful years ahead by the builders of the embryonic World Order of Baha'u'llah amidst the wreckage of a disrupted, disillusioned society. Received 

May 12, 1945               

  Our hearts are uplifted in thanksgiving for complete cessation of the prolonged, unprecedented  world conflict. 

 I hail the prospects of the #removal of the restrictions enabling 

American Baha'i Community   

 to expedite the preliminary measures required to launch the second stage of the Divine Plan. I appeal focus attention upon the requirements of the all-important Latin American work. The adequate fulfillment of this vital task preludes the assumption of collective responsibility by triumphant Community of the spiritual enlightenment and ultimate redemption of sorely-tried, war-ravaged European continent, destined to be associated with exploits which must immortalize the second stage of the World Mission entrusted by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the apostles of His Father's Faith in the western world. The opportunities of the present hour are infinitely precious, the time is pressing, the call of the distressed, groping peoples of Europe pitiful, insistent. The work still to be accomplished to consummate the mighty enterprise undertaken in Latin America is considerable. The Almighty's sustaining grace is assured, unfailing. I am praying from the depths of a joyful, thankful heart for the outpouring of blessings no less remarkable  than the divine bounties vouchsafed unto the valiant prosecutors of the

  Plan in the course of the opening phase of their 

World Mission.             
Message received August    

 20, 1945 Dear and valued coworkers: The cessation  of hostilities on the continent of Europe, the prospect of an early termination of the bloody conflict raging in the Far East, invest the members of the world Baha'i community, and particularly its standard-bearers in the great Republic of the West, with a great, a unique, and inescapable responsibility.  The first stage of the mission laid upon them by 'Abdu'l-Baha, the inauguration of which has been so long retarded while the processes of a siowiy emerging administrative order were being set in motion, and which coincided with one of the darkest and most tragic periods in human history, has been brought to a triumphant conclusion,  and added a golden page to the annals of the closing years of the first Baha'i century. 

 As a new phase in the painful evolution of a sorely-tried and wayward humanity opens, a new challenge summons the prosecutors  of a Divine Plan to gird up their loins, muster their resources, and prepare themselves for the launching of the second stage of an enterprise which, as it reveals its full potentialities, must stretch to embrace  the five continents of the globe. World turmoil, grave dangers, severe restrictions, the lethargy of the public engrossed in its war problems, have failed to dampen the zeal, or to undermine the resolve, or to interfere with the suc)cessful discharge of the duty assumed by those who have so determinedly embarked on the opening stage of their world encircling, divinely appointed mission. 

 With the return to more normal conditions, with the improvement of the means of travel and communication, with the lifting of the deadening weight of fear and care and the growing receptivity of the masses schooled in adversity and groping for the means of ultimate salvation, opportunities without number and unprecedented in their significance, present themselves to those whose privilege and obligation it is to pave the way for the launching of the succeeding stage of their historic and ever unfolding task. 

 Not until, however, normal conditions are fully restored and the world situation is stabilized, and, above all, the prizes won through the operation of the Seven-Year Plan are adequately safeguarded and the basis of the newly established Administration Order sufficiently consolidated throughout  the Western Hemisphere, can the ambassadors of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, carrying aloft the banner of His Name in the American continent, be called upon to undertake, unitedly and systematically, collective  responsibility for the diffusion of His Message, and for the erection of the fabric of His Administrative Order, amidst the sorrow-stricken, war-lacerated, sorely bewildered nations and peoples of the European  continent. 

 The sooner the home tasks are fully discharged, and the newly fledged Assemblies in Central and South America enabled to function adequately and vigorously, the sooner will the stalwart members of the American Baha'i community, who, during so brief a period, and despite the prevailing darkness, achieved such wonders throughout the Americas, extend the healing influence of their Faith, on a scale as yet unprecedented, to the waiting masses of that agitated continent. 

 As already observed, an intensification of effort is imperatively required aiming at a bolder proclamation of the verities of a God-given Faith, at a systematic and con-tinent-wide  dissemination of its authentic literature, at a closer contact with the masses as well as the leaders of public thought, at a further consolidation and  multiplication  of the administrative centers scattered throughout the new world, and constituting the nuclei of its future World Order, and, above all, at a more convincing revelation of Baha'i love, unity, solidarity and self-sacrifice,  which alone can hasten the consummation of the preliminary undertakings required to terminate the period of transition intervening between the first and second stages of the greatest crusade ever launched in the history of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 Time is. pressing, the work that still remains to be accomplished in the new world is vast and urgent, the need of the suffering

  masses, the world over, and particularly in Europe, is pitiable, the sustaining grace destined  to be vouchsafed from on high to those who will arise to achieve that task and fulfil this need is boundless and assured. 

 Its potency  has been already fully experienced, and abundantly demonstrated in the years that have witnessed the most prodigious efforts exerted by the American believers. 

 A still more powerful display of its mirac-uious force can be confidently anticipated, if those who have felt its impact in the past arise to carry out, in the years that lie immediately ahead, the sublime and twofold task of the redemption of mankind and the establishment of the world sovereignty of Baha'u'llah.

             THE MESSAGE OF BAHA'U'LLAH

  B AHA'U'LLAH'S incarceration in the prison-fortress of 'Akka, the manifold tribulations  He endured, the prolonged ordeal to which the community of His followers in Persia was being subjected, did not arrest, nor could they even impede, to the slightest degree, the mighty stream of Divine Revelation,  which, without interruption, had been flowing from His pen, and on which the future orientation, the integrity, the expansion and the consolidation of His Faith directly depended. 

 Indeed, in their scope and volume, His writings, during the years of His confinement in the Most Great Prison, surpassed the outpourings of His pen in either Adrianople or Baglid~d. More remarkable than the radical transformation in the circumstances of His own life in 'Akka, more far-reaching in its spiritual consequences  than the campaign of repression pursued so relentlessly by the enemies of His Faith in the land of His birth, this unprecedented extension in the range of His writings, during His exile in that Prison, must rank as one of the most vitalizing and fruitful stages in the evolution of His Faith. 

 The tempestuous winds that swept the Faith at the inception of His ministry and the wintry desolation that marked the beginnings of His prophetic career, soon after His banishment from TihrAn, were followed during the latter part of His sojourn in Bash&d, by what may be described as the vernal years of His Mission — years which witnessed the bursting into visible activity of the forces inherent in that Divine Seed that had lain dormant since the tragic removal  of 

His Forerunner. With His   

 arrival in Adrianople and the proclamation of His Mission the Orb of His Revelation climbed as it were to its zenith, and shone, as witnessed  by the style and tone of His writings, in the plenitude of its summer glory. The period of His incarceration in 'Akka brought with it the ripening of a siowiy maturing process, and was a period during which the choicest fruits of that mission were ultimately garnered. 

 The writings of Baha'u'llah during this period, as we survey the vast field which they embrace, seem to fall into three distinct categories. 

 The first comprises those writings  which constitute the sequel to the proc-larnation of His Mission in Adrianople. 

 The second includes the laws and ordinances of His Dispensation, which, for the most part, have been recorded in the KITAB-I-AQDAS; His Most Holy Book. To the third must be assigned those Tablets which partly enunciate  and partly reaffirm the fundamental tenets and principles underlying that Dispensation. 

 The Proclamation of His    

 Mission had been, as already observea, directed particularly to the kings of the earth, who, by virtue of the power and authority they wielded, were invested with a peculiar and inescapable responsibility for the destinies of their subjects. It was to these kings, as well as to the world's religious leaders, who


<p297>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH                                 297

  exercised a no iess pervasive influence on the mass of their followers, that the Prisoner of 'Akka directed His appeals, warnings, and exhortations during the first years of His incarceration in that city. rrUpon Our arrival  at this Prison," He Himself affirms, rrwe purposed to transmit to the kings. the messages of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised.  Though We have transmitted to them, in several Tablets, that which We were commanded, yet We do it once again, as a token of God's grace." 

 To the kings of the earth, both in the East and in the 'West, both Christian and Muslim, who had already been collectively admonished and warned in the Sfiriy — i-M~1fik revealed in Adrianople, and had been so vehemently summoned by the Bib, in the opening chapter of the Qayyiamu'1-AsmA', on the very night of the Declaration of His Mission, Baha'u'llah, during the darkest  days of His confinement in 'Akka, addressed  some of the noblest passages of His Most Holy Book. 

 In these passages He called upon them to take fast hold of the erMost Great 

Law"; proclaimed Himself   

 to be the King of Kings" and ~rthe Desire of all Nations"; declared them to be His revas sals" and reeinblems of His sovereignty"; disclaimed any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; bade them forsake their palaces, and hasten to gain admittance into His Kingdom; extolled the king who would arise to aid His Cause as "the very eye of mankind"; and finally arraigned them for the things which had befallen Him at their hands. 

     In His Tablet to Queen     

 Victoria He, moreover, invites these kings to hold fast to rethe Lesser Peace," since they had refused ~~the Most Great Peace"; exhorts them to be reconciled among themselves, to unite and to reduce their armaments; bids them refrain from laying excessive burdens on their subjects,  who, He informs them, are their ~~wards" and ~~treasures'~~ enunciates the principle that should any one among them take up arms against another, all should rise against him; and warns them not to deal with Him as the CCKing of Isidin" and his ministers had dealt. 

 To the emperor of the French, Napoleon HI, the most prominent and influential mon arch of his day in the West, designated by Him as the crchief of Sovereigns," and who, to quote His words, had cecast behind his back" the Tablet revealed for him in Adri-anople, He, while a prisoner in the army barracks, addressed a second Tablet and transmitted it through the French agent in 'Akka. 

 In chis He announces the coining of Him Who is the Unconstrained," whose purpose is to ~quicken the world" and unite its peoples; unequivocally asserts that Jesus Christ was the Herald of His Mission; proclaims  the fall of !7hC stars of the firmament of knowledge," who have turned aside from Him; exposes that monarch's insincerity; and clearly prophesies that his kingdom shall be rrthrown into confusion," that his f!en$ fire shall pass" from his hands, and that commotions shall seize all the people in that land," unless he arises to help the Cause of God and follow 

Him Who is His Spirit.     

 In memorable passages addressed to "the Rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics therein" He, in His KITAB-I-AQDAS, calls upon them to rradorn the temple of dominion with the ornament of justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of remembrance" of their Lord; declares that erthe Promised One" has been made manifest; counsels them to avail themselves  of the !!Day of God"; and bids them bind with the hands of justice the broken" and rrcrush~~ the rroppressor~~ with ~~the rod of the commandments of their Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.~~ 

   To Nicolacyitch Alexander  

 H, the all-powerful  Czar of Russia, He addressed, as He lay a prisoner in the barracks, an Epistle wherein He announces the advent of the promised Father, Whom rrthe tongue of Isaiah loath extolled," and with Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were adorned"; commands him to C Carise and summon the nations unto God"; warns him to beware lest his sovereignty withhold him from rrHim Who is the Supreme Sovereign"; acknowledges the aid extended by his 

Ambassador  in Tihrin;    

 and cautiohs him not to forfeit the station ordained for him by God. 

 To Queen Victoria He, during that same period, addressed an Epistle in which He calls upon her to incline her ear to the voice


<p298>
298             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of her Lord, the Lord of all mankind; bids her ~~cast away all that is on earth," and set her heart towards her Lord, the Ancient of Days; asserts that ~~ail that hath been mentioned in the Gospel bath been flU-ft  lied"; assures her that God would reward her for having rrforbidden the trading in slaves," were she to follow what has been sent unto her by Him; commends her for having frentrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the refiresentatives of the peo-ftle";  and exhorts them to erregard themselves as the representatives of all that dwell on earth," and to judge between men with frpure justice." 

 In a celebrated passage addressed to Wil-ham  I, King of Prussia and newly-acclaimed emperor of a unified Germany, He, in His Kiuib-i-Aqdas, bids the sovereign hearken to 

His Voice, the Voice       

 of God Himself; warns him to take heed lest his pride debar him from recognizing the DaySpring of Divine Revelation," and admonishes him to rrreineinber the one (Napoleon III) whose power transcended" his power, and who rrwent down to dust in great loss." Furthermore,  in that same Book, apostrophizing the rrbanks of the Rhine," He predicts that rethe swords of retribution" would be drawn against them, and that eethe lamentations of Berlin" would be raised, though at that time she was ~in conspicuous glory." 

 In another notable passage of that same Book, addressed to Francis-Joseph, the Austrian  Emperor and heir of the Holy Roman Empire, Baha'u'llah reproves the sovereign for having neglected to inquire about Him in the course of a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; takes God to witness that He had found him ~~ clinging unto the Branch and heedless of the Root"; grieves to observe his waywardness; and bids him open his eyes and gaze on !!the Light that shineth above this luminous Horizon." 

   To 'Au PAsh~ the Grand     

 Vizir of the Sulvdn of Turkey He addressed, shortly after His arrival in 'Akka, a second Tablet, in which He reprimands him for his cruelty C!that haM made hell to blaze and the Spirit to lament"; recounts his acts of oppression; condemns him as one of those who, from time immemorial, have denounced the Prophets as stirrers of mischief; prophesies his downfall; expatiates on His own sufferings and those of His fellow-exiles; extolls their fortitude and detachment; predicts that God's ~~wrathful anger" will seize him and his government, that r~sed;tion will be stirred up" in their midst, and that their ado-minions  will be disrupted"; and affirms that were he to awake, he would abandon all his possessions, and would e!choose to abide in one of the dilapidated rooms of this Most Great Prison." 

 In the Lawh-i-Fu'&d, in the course of His reference to the premature death of the SultAn's Foreign 

Minister, Fu'5d P~sh~      

 He thus confirms His above-men-tioned  prediction: rrso~ will We dismiss the one (tAll PisM) who was like unto him and will lay hold on their 

Chief (Su1~An 'Abdu'1-'Aziz)

 who ruleth the land, and I, verily, am the Almighty, the All-Com-pelling." 

 No less outspoken and emphatic are the messages, some embodied in specific Tablets, others interspersed through His writings, which Baha'u'llah addressed to the world's ecclesiastical leaders of all denominations —  messages in which He discloses, clearly and unreservedly, the claims of His Revelation, summons them to heed His call, and denounces,  in certain specific cases, their perversity,  their extreme arrogance and tyranny. 

 In immortal passages of His KITAB-I-AQDAS  and other Tablets He bids the entire company of these ecclesiastical leaders to i•e fear God," to ~rezn in" their pens, er jUng away idle fancies and imaginings, and turn then towards the Horizon of Certitude"; warns them to !f weigh not the Book of God (Kitab-i-Aqdas) with such standards and sciences as are current" amongst them; designates  that same Book as the CeUnerring Balance established amongst men"; laments over their blindness and waywardness; asserts His superiority in vision, insight, utterance and wisdom; proclaims His innate and God. given knowledge; cautions them not to ~shut out the people by yet another veil," after He Himself had errent the veils asunder";  accuses them of having been e!the cause of the repudiation oji the Faith in its early days"; and adjures them to feperuse with fairness and justice that which bath been sent down" by Him, and to !Cnullify not the Truth" with the things they possess.

  The Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Baltimore, Maryland, incorporated in August, 1945. 

  To Pope Pius IX, the undisputed head of the most powerful Church in Christendom, possessor of both temporal and spiritual authority, He, a Prisoner in the army barracks  of the penal-colony of 'Akka, addressed  a most weighty Epistle, in which He announces that C!He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed with clouds," and that a the Word which the Son concealed  is made manifest." He, moreover, warns him not to dispute with Him even as the Pharisees of old disputed with Jesus Christ; bids him leave his palaces unto such as desire them, fCseIl all the embellished ornaments" in his possession, ~~expend them in the path of God," abandon his kingdom unto the kings, !rarise amidst the peoples of the earth," and summon them to His Faith. Regarding him as one of the suns of the heaven of God's names, He cautions him to guard himself lest rrdarkness spread it veils" over him; calls upon him to erexh,Jrt the kings" to ~~deal equitably with men"; and &ounsels him to walk in the footsteps of his Lord, and follow His example. 

 To the patriarchs of the Christian Church He issued a specific summons in which He proclaims the coming of the. Promised One; exhorts them to f!Iear God" and nor to follow t~the vain imaginings of the super

  stitious"; and directs them to lay aside the things they possess and ertake fast hold of the Tablet of God by His sovereign power." To the archbishops of that Church He similarly declares that "He Who is the Lord of all men hath appeared," that they are !fnum~ bered with the dead," and that great is the blessedness of him who is "stirred by the breeze of God, and bath arisen from amongst the dead in this perspicuous Name." In passages  addressed to its bishops He proclaims that e!the Everlasting Father calleth aloud between earth and heaven," pronounces them to be the fallen stars of the heaven of His knowledge, and affirms that His body ~yearneth for the cross" and His head is rregger for the spear in the path of the All-Merciful."  The concourse of Christian priests He bids eeleave the bells," and come forth from their churches; exhorts them to apro claim aloud the Most Great Name among the nations"; assures them that whoever  will summon men in His Name will ~eshow forth that which is beyond the frower of all that are on earth"; warns them that the "Day of Reckoning hath appeared"; and counsels them to turn with their hearts to their Lard, the Forgiving, the Generous." In numerous passages addressed to the ~~c~iz course of monks" He bids them not to seclude themselves in churches and cloisters, but to occupy themselves with that which will profit their souls and the souls of men; enioins them to enter into wedlock; and affirms that if they choose to follow Him He will make them heirs of His Kingdom, and that if they transgress against Him, He will, in His longsuffering, endure it patiently. 

 And finally, in several passages addressed to the entire body of the followers of Jesus Christ 

He identifies Himself     

 with the rrFather~) spoken of by Isaiah, with the acon;forter~~ 

Whose Covenant He Who     

 is the Spirit (Jesus) had Himself established, and with the Crspirit of Truth" Who will guide them crinto all truth"; proclaims His Day to be the Day of God; announces the conjunction of the river Jordan with the C!Most Great Ocean"; asserts their heedlessness  as well as His own claim to have opened unto them rethe gates of the Kingdom"; affirms that the promised erTemple~~ has. been built crwith the hands of the will" of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bounteous; bids them ~!rend the veils asunder," and enter in 

His name His Kingdom;     

 recalls the saying of Jesus to Peter; and assures them that, if they choose to follow Him, He will make them to become rrquickeners of mankind." 
    To the entire body of     

Muslim ecciesiastics Baha'u'llah

 specifically devoted innumerable passages in His Books and Tablets, wherein He, in vehement language, denounces their cruelty; condemns their pride and arrogance; calls upon them to lay aside the things they possess, to hold their peace, and give car to the words He has spoken; and asserts that, by reason of their deeds, rrthe exalted station of the people hath been abased, the standard of Isldm hath been reversed, and its mighty throne ha/h fallen." 

 To the eeconcourse of Persian divines" He more particularly addressed  His condemnatory words in which He stigmatizes their deeds, and prophesies that their glory will be turned into the most wretched abasement," and that they shall behold the punishment which will be inflicted upon them, rr~~ decreed by God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise." 

 To the Jewish people, He, moreover, announced that the Most Great Law has come, that rrthe Ancient Beauty ruleth ufion the throne of David," Who cries aloud and in —  vokes His 

Name, that ~from Zion     

 bath ez~-peared  that which was hidden," and that refrom Jerusalem is heard the Voice of God, the One, the Incorn parable, the 

Omniscient."              

 To the rr/jigh priests" of the Zoroastrian Faith He, furthermore, proclaimed that CC the Incomparable Friend" is manifest, that He ~speaketb that wherein lietla salvation," that erthe Hand of Omnipotence is stretched forth from behind the clouds," that the tokens of His majesty and greatness are unveiled; and declared that ~ man's acts shall be acceptable in this day unless he forsaketh mankind and all that men possess, and settetla his face towards the Omnipotent 

One."                     

 Some of the weightiest passages of His Epistle to Queen Victoria are addressed to the members of the British Legislature, the Mother of Parliaments, as well as to the elected representatives of the peoples in other lands. 

 In these He asserts that His purpose is to quicken the world and unite


<p301>
THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH           301

  its peoples; refers to the treatment meted out to Him by His enemies; exhorts the legislators to retake counsel together," and to concern themselves only ~ with that which pro fiteth mankind"; and affirms that the ~sovereign remedy" for the healing of all the world" is the ~ of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith," which can ~in no wise be achieved except through the rower of a skilled and all-pow-erful and inspired Physician." 

 He, moreover, in His Most Holy Book, has enjoined the selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script for all on earth to use, an injunction which, when carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that Book, be one of the signs of the frcoming of age of the human race." 

 No iess significant are the words addressed separately by Him to the !rpeople of the Baydn," to the wise men of the world, to its poets, to its men of letters, to its mystics and even to its tradesmen, in which He exhorts them to be attentive to His voice, to recognize His Day, and to follow His bidding. 

 Such in sum are the salient features of the concluding utterances of that historic Proclamation,  the opening notes of which were sounded during the latter part of Baha'u'llah's  banishment to Adrianople, and which closed during the early years of His incarceration in the prison-fortress of 'Akka. Kings and emperors, severally and collectively; the chief magistrates of the Republics of the American continent; ministers and ambassadors; the Sovereign Pontiff  himself; the Vicar of the Prophet of IslAm; the royal Trustee of the Kingdom of the Hidden ImAm; the monarchs of Christendom,  its patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, priests and monks; the recognized leaders of both the Sunni and Shitah sacerdotal orders; the high priests of the Zoroastrian religion; the philosophers, the ecclesiastical leaders, the wise men and the inhabitants of Constantinople — that proud seat of both the Sultanate and the Caliphate; the entire company of the professed adherents of the Zoroastrian, the 

Jewish, the Christian      

 and Muslim Faiths; the people of the BaySn; the wise men of the world, its men of letters, its poets, its mystics, its tradesmen, the elected representatives of its peoples; His own countrymen — all have, at one time or another, in books, Epistles, and Tablets, been brought directly within the purview of the exhortations, the warnings, the appeals, the declarations and the prophecies which constitute the theme of His momentous summons  to the leaders of mankind — a summons which stands unparalleled in the annals of any previous religion, and to which the messages  directed by the Prophet of IslAm to some of the rulers among His contemporaries alone offer a faint resemblance. 

 rCNever since t~ beginning of the world," Baha'u'llah Himself affirms, rehath the Message  been so openly proclaimed." Each one of them," He, specifically referring to the Tablets addressed by Him to the sovereigns of the eatth — Tablets acclaimed by Abd'1 Bali as a rrmiracle~thas written, ?rhath bcen designated by a special name. The first bath been named !The Rumbling,' the sec~>~] 

 r7Joj~{ Blow,' the third ~The Inevitable,' the fourth !The Plain,' the fifth The Catastrophe,' and the others CThe Stunning Trum p4-Blast,' eThe Near Event,' ~The Great Terror,' tThe Trumpet,' The Bugle,' and the like, so that all the fieo pies of the earth may know, of a certainty, and may witness, with outward and inner eyes, that He Who is the Lord of Names bath prevailed, and will continue to prevail, under all conditions, over all men." The most important  of these Tablets, together with the celebrated 

SAriy-i-Haykal (the SArili 

 of the Temple), He, moreover, ordered to be written in the shape of a pentacle, symbolizing the temple of man, and which He identified, when addressing the followers of the Gospel in one of His Tablets, with the ~tTemp1e" mentioned by the Prophet Zechariah, and designated as "the resplendent dawning-place of the All-Merciful," and which the hands of the power of Him Who is the Causer of Causes" had built. 

 Unique and stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to be but a prelude to a still mightier revelation of the creative power of its Author, and to what may well rank as the most signal act of His ministry — the promulgation of the 

Kitab-i-Aqdas. Alluded     

 to in the KitTh-i-fq~n; the principal repository of that Law which the 

Prophet


<p302>
302             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Isaiah had anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had described as the renew heaven" and the C mew earth," as frthe Tabernacle  of God," as the CrHoIy City," as the rfBride,~~ the frNew Jerusalem coming down from God," this rfMost Holy Book," whose provisions must remain inviolate for no less than a thousand years, and whose system will embrace the entire planet, may well be regarded as the brightest emanation of the mind of Baha'u'llah, as the Mother Book of His Dispensation, and the 

Charter of His New World   
Order.                     

 Revealed soon after Baha'u'llah had been transferred to the house of tOdi Khamm~r (circa 1873), at a time when He was still encompassed by the tribulations that had afflicted Him, through the acts committed by His enemies and the professed adherents of His Faith, this Book, this treasury en.-shrining  the priceless gems of His Revelation, stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates, the administrative institutions it ordains and the function with which it invests the appointed Successor of its Author, unique and incomparable among the world's sacred Scriptures. 

 For, unlike the Old Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are nonexistent; unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration of the affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur'an which, though explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God, is silent on the all-important subject of the succession, the Kitab-i-Aqdas, revealed from first to last by the Author of the Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances on which the fabric of His future World Order must rest, but ordains, in addition, to the function of interpretation which it confers upon His Successor, the necessary institutions through which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be safeguarded. 

 In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author — at once the Judge, the Lawgiver, the 

Unifier and Redeemer

In it He formally ordains the institution of the fCHouse of Justice," defines its functions, fixes its revenues, and designates its members  as the ~~Men of Justice," the !rDeputies of God," the rCTrustees of the All-Merci-Ju4" alludes to the future Center of His Covenant, and invests Him with the right of interpreting His holy Writ; anticipates by implication the institution of Guardianship;  bears witness to the revolutionizing effect of His World Order; enunciates the doctrine of the ~~Most Great In fallibility" of the Manifestation of God; asserts this infallibility to be the inherent and exclusive right of the Prophet; and rules out the possibility of the appearance of another Manifestation ere the lapse of at least one thousand years.

  every person the duty of writing a testament and of strict obedience to one's government. 
     Apart from these provisions

IBahA'u'llAh exhorts His   

 followers to consort, with amity and concord and without discrimination, with the adherents of all religions; warns them to guard against fanaticism, sedition, pride, dispute and contention; inculcates upon them immaculate cleanliness, strict truthfulness, spotless chastity, trustworthiness; hospita1it~, fidelity, courtesy, forbearance, justice and fairness; counsels them to be t~even as the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one body"; calls upon them to arise and serve His Cause; and assures them of His undoubted aid. He, furthermore, dwells upon the instability of human affairs; declares that true liberty consists in man's submission to His commandments; cautions them not to be indulgent in carrying our his statutes; prescribes the twin inseparable duties of. recognizing the rrDayspring of God's Revelation" and of observing all the ordinances revealed by Him, neither of which, He affirms, is acceptable without the other. 

 The significant summons issued to the Presidents of the Republics of the American continent to seize their opportunity in the Day of God and to champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the members of parliaments throughout the world, urging the adoption of a universal script and language;  His warnings to William I, the conqueror of Napoleon III; the reproof He administers to Francis Joseph, the 

Emperor of Austria; His    

 reference to Crthe lamentations of Berlin" in His apostrophe to fr/he banks of the Rhine"; His condemnation of C!the throne of tyranny" established in Constantinople, and His prediction of the extinction  of its rroutward splendor" and of the tribulations destined to overtake its inhabitants; the words of cheer and comfort He addresses to His native city, assuring her that God had chosen her to be the source of the joy of alt mankind"; his prophecy that rrthe voice of the heroes of Khurdsdn" will be raised in glorification of their Lord; His assertion that men ~ endued with mighty valor" will be raised up in Kirmin who will make mention of Him; and finally, His magnanimous assurance to a perfidious brother who bad afflicted Him with such anguish, that an frever~f urgiving, all-bounte-ous"  God would forgive him his iniquities were he only to repent — all these further enrich the contents of a Book designated by its Author as fr/he source of true felicity," as the t~Unerring Balance," as the trStraight Path" and as the rrquickener of mankind." 

 The laws and ordinances that constitute the major theme of this Book, Baha'u'llah, moreover, has specifically characterized as rethe breath of life unto all created things," as rtthe mightiest stronghold," as the "fruits" of His rfTree,~~ as rrthe highest means for the maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples," as Crthe lamps of His wisdom and loving-providence," as r7he sweet smelling savor of His garment," as the "keys" of His ~rmercy~~ to His creatures.  This Book," He Himself testifies, "is a heaven which We have adorned with the stars of Our commandments and prohibitions."  "Blessed the man," He, moreover, has stated, erwho will read it, and ponder  the verses sent down in it by God, the Lord of Power, the Almighty. Say, 0 men! Take hold of it with the hand of resignation. ... 

 By My life! It hath been sent down in a manner that amazeth the minds of men. Verily, it is My weightiest testimony unto all people, and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and cdl who are on earth." 

 And again: erBIessed the palate that savoreth its sweetness, and the ~erceiv-ing  eye that recognizeth that which is treasured therein, and the understanding heart that comprehend eth its allusions and mysteries.  By God! Such is the majesty of what bath been revealed therein, and so tremendous the revelation of its veiled allusions that the loins of utterance shake when attempting their description." 

 And finaHy: ~!In such a manner hath the Kitab-i-Aqdas been revealed  that it atirewleth an embraceth all the divinely appointed Dispensatio'ns. Blessed those who peruse it! Blessed those who apprehend  it! 

 Blessed those who meditate upon it! Blessed those who ponder its meaning! So vast is its range that it bath encompassed all men ere their recognition of it. lire long will its sovereign flower, its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be manifested on earth."

  Members of the recently incorporated Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Dayton, Ohio. 

  The formulation by Baha'u'llah, in His Kitab-i-Aqdas, of the fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission drew to a ciose, by the enunciation of certain precepts and principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the reaffirmation  of truths He had previously proclaimed,  by the elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws He had already laid down, by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings, and by the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to supplement  the provisions of His Most Holy Book. These were recorded in unnumbered Tablets,  which He continued to reveal until the last days of His earthly life, among which the "IshrAq~t" 

(Splendors), the ~tBsMdt" (Glad
Tidings), the "Tar~zAt"    
(Orna-ments),  the "TajalliyAt"
(Effulgences), the "KalimAt-i-Firdawsiyyih"

 (Words of Paradise), the ttLawh~i~Aqdas~~ (Most Holy Tablet),  the 

"Lawh-i-Duny~" (Tablet     

 of the World), the ~ (Tablet of Maqsiad), are the most noteworthy. These Tablets — mighty and final effusions of His indefatigable pen — must rank among the choicest fruits which His mind has yielded, and mark the consummation of His forty-year-long ministry. 

 Of the principles enshrined in these Tab.-lets  the most vital of them all is the principle  of the oneness and wholeness of the human race, which may well be regarded as the hallmark of Baha'u'llah's Revelation and the pivot of His teachings. Of such cardinal importance is this principle of unity that it is expressly referred to in the Book of His Covenant, and He unreservedly proclaims it as the central purpose of His Faith. ~~ We, verily," He declares, ~~have come to unite and weld together all that dwell on earth." 

 ~~So potent is the light of unity," He further states, ~~that it can illuminate  the whole earth." ~AI one time," He has written with reference to this central  theme of His Revelation, CrWJe spoke in the language of the lawgiver; at another in that of the truth seeker and the mystic, and yet Our supreme purpose and highest wish hath always been to disclose the glory and sublimity of this station." Unity, He states, is the goal that erexcelleth every goal"

  and an aspiration which is ~~the monarch of all aspirations." f!The world," He proclaims, is but one country, and mankind its citizens."  He further affirms that the unifica-don of mankind, the last stage in the evolution of humanity towards maturity is inevitable, that ~soon will the present day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead," that frthe whole earth is now in a state of pregnancy," that rrthe day is approaching when it will have yielded its noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth the loftiest trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly blessings." 

 He deplores the defectiveness of the prevailing order, exposes the inadequacy of patriotism as a directing and controlling force in human  society, and regards the !!Iove of mankind"  and service to its interests as the worthiest and most Laudable objects of human  endeavor. He, moreover, laments that rethe vitality of men's belief in God is dying out in every land," that the Cjace of the world" is turned towards rrwaywardness and unbelief"; proclaims religion to be era radiant light and an impregnable stronghold for the protection and welfare of the peoples of the world" and !cthe chief instrument for the establishment of order in the world"; affirms its fundamental purpose to be the promotion of union and concord amongst men; warns lest it be made ~ source of dissension, of discord and hatred"; commands  that its principles be taught to children in the schools of the world, in a manner  that would not be productive of either prejudice or fanaticism; attributes re1 he way-weirdness  of the ungodly" to the Cf decline of religion"; and predicts ccconvulsions~~ of such severity as to ~~cause the limbs of mankind  to quake." 

 The principle of collective security He unreservedly urges; recommends the reduction  in national armaments; and proclaims as necessary and inevitable the convening of a world gathering at which the kings and rulers of the world will deliberate for the establishment of peace among the nations. 

 Justice He extols as CCthe light of men" and their e~guardian,3~ as tethe revealer of the secrets of the world of being, and the stand-ard-bearer ard-bearer of love and bounty"; declares its radiance to be incomparable; affirms that upon it must depend ~~the organization of the world and the tranquility of mankind." He characterizes its rrtwo pilIars~~~~ef reward and punishinent" — as ~1•the sources of life" to the human race; warns the peoples of the world to bestir themselves in anticipation of its advent; and prophesies that, after an interval of great turmoil and grievous injustice,  its daystar will shine in its full splendor and glory. 

 He, furthermore, inculcates the principle of moderation in all things"; declares that whatsoever, be it ~~Liberty, civilization and the like," repasseth beyond the limits of moderation~~ must f!exercise a pernicious influence  upon men"; observes that western civilization has gravely perturbed and alarmed the peoples of the world; and predicts that the day is approaching when the ~~flame" of a civilization carried to excess" Twill devour the cities." 

 Consultation He establishes as one of the fundamental principles of His Faith; describes  it as rrthe lamp of guidance," as fCthe bestower of understanding," and as one of the two ~~luminaries" of the C!heaven of Divine  wisdom." 

 Knowledge, He states, is teas wings to man's life and a ladder for his ascent"; its acquisition He regards as cumbent upon every one"; considers eearts, crafts and sciences" to be conducive to the exaltation of the world of being; commends the wealth acquired through crafts and professions; acknowledges the indebtedness of the peoples of the world to scientists and craftsmen; and discourages the study of such sciences as are unprofitable to men, and C rhe gin with words and end with wards." 

 The injunction to consort with all men in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship" He further emphasizes, and recognizes such association to be conducive to !m~ and concord," which, He affirms, are the establishers of order in the world and the quickeners of nations. The necessity of adopting a universal tongue and script He repeatedly stresses; deplores the waste of time involved in the study of divers languages;  affirms that with the adoptiob of

  such a language and script the whole earth will be considered as "one city and one land"; and claims to be possessed of the knowledge of both, and ready to impart it to any one who might seek it from Him. 

 To the trustees of the House of Justice He assigns the duty of legislating on matters not expressly provided in His writings, and promises  that God will rejns pire them with whatsoever  lie willeth." 

 The establishment of a constitutional form of government, in which the ideals of republicanism and the majesty of kingship, characterized by Him as crone of the signs of God," are combined, He recommends as a meritorious achievement; urges that special regard be paid to the interests of. agriculture; and makes specific refcrence to rethe swiftly appearing newspapers," describes them as rr the mirror of the world" and as rran amazing and potent phenomenon," and prescribes to all who are responsible for their production the duty to be sanctified from malice, passion and prejudice, to be just and fair-minded, to be painstaking  in their inquiries, and ascertain all the facts in every situation.

In consequence of these activities the National Spiritual Assembly is called upon to administer such an ever-increasing diversity and volume of affairs and properties for the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, that we, its members, now feel it jboth desirable and necessary to give our collective functions more definite legal form. 

 This action is taken in complete unanimity and with full recognition of the sacred rela tionship thereby created. 

 We acknowledge in behalf of ourselves and our successors in this Trust the exalted religious standard established by 

Baha'u'llah for Baha'i

THE INSTITUTION OF THE
                 MASHRJQU' L-ADHKAR

 Visible Embodiment of the Universality of the Faith of Baha'u'llah  

                      FOREWORD

  MANY discerning minds have testified to the profoundly significant change which has taken place during recent years in the character of popular religious thinking. Religion has developed an entirely new emphasis,  more especially for the layman, quite independent of the older sectarian divisions. 

 Instead of considering that religion is a matter of turning toward an abstract creed, the average religionist today is concerned with the practical applications of religion to the problems of human life. Religion, in brief, after having apparently lost its influence  in terms of theology, has been restored more powerfully than ever as a spirit of brotherhood, an impulse toward unity, and an ideal making far a more enlightened civilization throughout the world. 

 Against this background, the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar stands revealed as the supreme expression of all those modern religious tendencies animated by social ideals which do not repudiate the reality of spiritual experience but seek to transform it into a dynamic striving for unity. The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar  when clearly understood, gives the world its most potent agency for applying mystical vision or idealistic aspiration  to the service of humanity. It makes visible and concrete those deeper meanings and wider possibilities of religion which could not be realized until the dawn of this universal age. 

  The term "Mashriqu'l-Adhkar"

 means literally, ttDawning-place of the praise of God." 

 To appreciate the signi&ance of this Baha'i institution, we must lay aside all customary ideas of the churches and cathedrals of the past. The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar fulfills the original intention of religion in each dispensation, before that intention had become altered and veiled by human invention and belief. 

   The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar     

 is a channel releasing spiritual powers for social regenera-don  because it fills a different function than that assumed by the sectarian church. 

 Its essential purpose is to provide a community meeting-place for all who are seeking to worship God, and achieves this purpose by interposing no manmade veils between the worshiper and the Supreme. Thus, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is freely open to people of all Faiths on equal terms, who now realize the universality of Baha'u'llah in revealing the oneness of all the Prophets. 

 Moreover, since the Baha'i Faith has no professional clergy, the worshiper entering the Temple hears no sermon and takes part in no ritual the emotional effect of which is to establish a separate group consciousness. 

 Integral with the Temple are its accessory buildings, without which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar would not be a complete social institution.  These buildings are to be devoted to such activities as a school for science, a hospice, a hospital, an asylum for orphans. Here the circle of spiritual experience at last joins, as prayer and worship are allied directly  to creative service, eliminating the static subjective elements from religion and laying a foundation for a new and higher type of human association.

          THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
                  MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR

            A LETTER FROM SHOGHI EFFENDI

  The   Beloved of the Lord and the Handmaids  of the Merciful throughout the United States and Canada. 

  My well-beloved friends: Ever since that remarkable manifestation of Baha'i solidarity and self-sacrifice which has signalized the proceedings of last year's memorable Convention, I have been expectantly  awaiting the news of a steady and continuous support of the Plan which can alone ensure, ere the present year draws to its close, the resumption of building operations on our beloved Temple. 

 Moved by an impulse that I could not resist,  I have felt impelled to forego what may be regarded as the most valuable and sacred possession in the Holy Land for the furthering of that noble enterprise which you have set your hearts to achieve. With the hearty concurrence of our dear Baha'i brother, Ziaoulhh Asgarzadeh, who years ago donated  it to the Most Holy Shrine, this precious  ornament of the Tomb of Baha'u'llah has been already shipped to your shores, with our fondest hope that the proceeds from its sale may at once ennoble and reinforce the unnumbered offerings of the American believers already accumulated on the altar of Baha sacrifice. 

 I have longed ever since to witness such evidences of spontaneous and generous response on your part as would tend to fortify within me a confidence that has never wavered in the inexhaustible vitality of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in that land. 

 I need not stress at this moment the high hopes which so startling a display of unsparing  devotion to our sacred Temple has already aroused in the breasts of the multitude  of our brethren throughout the East. Nor is it I feel necessary to impress upon those who are primarily concerned with its erection the gradual change of outlook which the early prospect of the construc-don  of the far-famed Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in America has unmistakably occasioned in high places among the hitherto sceptical and indifferent towards the merits and the practicability of the Faith proclaimed by Baha'u'llah.  Neither do I need to expatiate upon the hopes and fears of the Greatest Holy Leaf, now in the evening of her life, with deepening shadows caused by failing eyesight  and declining strength swiftly gathering about her, yearning to hear as the one remaining solace in her swiftly ebbing life the news of the resumption of work on an Edifice, the glories of which she has, from the lips of 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, learned to admire. I cannot surely overrate at the present juncture in the progress of our task the challenging character of these remaining months of the year as a swiftly passing opportunity  which it is in our power to seize and utilize, ere it is too late, for the edification  of our expectant brethren throughout the East, for the vindication in the eyes of the world at large of the realties of our Faith, and last but not least for the realization  of what is the Greatest Holy Leaf's fondest desire. 

 As I have already intimated in the course of my conversations with visiting pilgrims, so vast and significant an enterprise as the construction of the first Mashriqu'1-Adbk6x of the West should be supported, not by the munificence of a few but by the joint contributions  of the entire mass of the convinced followers of the Faith. 

 It cannot be denied that the emanations of spiritual power and inspiration destined to radiate from the central Edifice of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will to a very large extent depend upon the range and variety of the contributing believers, as well as upon the nature and degree of self-abnegation which their unsolicited offerings will entail. Moreover, we should, I feel, regard it as an axiom and guiding principle of Baha'i administration that in the conduct of every specific Baha'i


<p403>
THE INSTITUTION OF THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR                       403

  activity, as different from undertakings of a humanitarian, philanthropic, or charitable character, which may in future be conducted  under Baha'i auspices, oniy those who have already identified themselves with the Faith and are regarded as its avowed and unreserved supporters should be invited to join and collaborate. 

 For apart from the consideration of embarrassing complications which the association of nonbelievers in the financing of institutions of a strictly Baha'i character may conceivably engender in the administration of the Baha'i community of the future, it should be remembered that these specific Baha institutions, which should be viewed in the light of Baha'u'llah's gifts bestowed upon the world, can best function and most powerfully exert their influence in the world only if reared and maintained solely by the support of those who are fully conscious of, and are unreservedly submissive to, the claims inherent in the Revelation of IBaM'u'IlAh. In cases, however, when a friend or sympathizer of the Faith eagerly insists on a monetary contribution for the promotion of the Faith, such gifts should be accepted and duly acknowledged  by the elected representatives of the believers with the express understanding that they would be utilized by them only to reinforce that section of the Baha'i Fund exclusively devoted to philanthropic or charitable purposes. For, as the Faith of Baha'u'llah extends in scope and in influence, and the resources of Baha'i communities correspondingly multiply, it will become increasingly  desirable to differentiate between such departments of the Baha'i treasury as minister to the needs of the world at large, and those that are specifically designed to promote the direct interests of the Faith itself. 

 From this apparent divorce between Baha'i and humanitarian activities it must not, however, be inferred that the animating purpose of the Faith of Baha'u'llah stands at variance with the aims' and objects of the humanitarian and philanthropic institutions of the day. Nay, it should be realized by every judicious promoter of the Faith that at such an early stage in the evolution and crystallization of the Cause such discrimi nating and precautionary measures are inevitable and even necessary if the nascent institutions of the Faith are to emerge triumphant  and unimpaired from the present welter of confused and often conflicting interests with which they are surrounded. This note of warning may not be thought inappropriate at a time when, inflamed by a consuming passion to witness the early completion of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar we may not only be apt to acquiesce in the desire of those who, as yet uninitiated into the Cause, are willing to lend financial assistance  to its institutions, but may even feel inclined to solicit from them such aid as it is in their power to render. Ours surely is the paramount duty so to acquit ourselves in the discharge of our most sacred task that in the days to come neither the tongue of the slanderer nor the pen of the malevolent may dare to insinuate that so beauteous, so significant an Edifice has been reared by anything short of the unanimous, the exclusive, and the self-sacrificing strivings  of the small yet determined body of the convinced supporters of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 How delicate our task, how pressing the responsibility that weighs upon us, who are called upon on one hand to preserve inviolate the integrity and the identity  of the regenerating Faith of DaM'-u'lUh,  and to vindicate on the other its broad, its humanitarian, its all-embracing principlesi True, we cannot fail to realize at the pres-cut stage of our work the extremely limited number of contributors qualified to lend financial support to such a vast, such an elaborate and costly enterprise. We are fully aware of the many issues and varied Baha'i activities that are unavoidably held in abeyance  pending the successful conclusion of the Plan of Unified Action. We are oniy too conscious of the pressing need of some sort of befitting and concrete embodiment of the spirit animating the Cause that would stand in the heart of the American Continent  both as a witness and as a rallying center to the manifold activities of a fast growing Faith. 

 But spurred by those reflections  may we not bestir ourselves and resolve


<p404>
404             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  as we have never resolved before to hasten by every means in our power the consummation  of this all-absorbing yet so meritorious task? I beseech you, dear friends, not to allow considerations of number, or the consciousness of the limitation of our resources, or even the experience of inevitable setbacks which every mighty undertaking is bound to encounter, to blur your vision, to dim your hopes, or to paralyze your efforts in the prosecution of your divinely appointed task. 

 Neither, do r entreat you, suffer the least deviation into the paths of expediency  and compromise to obstruct those channels of vivifying grace that can alone provide the inspiration and strength vital not oniy to the successful conduct of its material construction, but to the fulfillment of its high destiny. 

 And while we bend our efforts and strain our nerves in a feverish pursuit to provide the necessary means for the speedy construction  of the Mashriqu'1 — Adhk~r, may we not pause for a moment to examine those statements  which set forth the purpose as well as the functions of this symbolical yet so spiritually potent Edifice? It will be readily admitted that at a time when the tenets of a Faith, not yet fully emerged from the fires of repression, are as yet improperly defined and imperfectly understood, the utmost caution  should be exercised in revealing the true nature of those institutions which are indissolubly associated with its name. 

 Without attempting an exhaustive survey of the distinguishing features and purpose of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar I should feel content at the present time to draw your attention  to what I regard as certain misleading statements that have found currency in various  quarters, and which may lead gradually to a grave misapprehension of the true purpose  and essential character of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 It should be borne in mind that the central Edifice of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar round which in the fullness of time shall cluster such institutions of social service as shall afford relief to the suffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the bereaved, and education to the ignorant, should be regarded apart from these Dependencies, as a House solely designed and entirely dedicated to the worship of God in accordance with the few yet definitely prescribed principles established by Baha'u'llah in the Kidb-i-Aqdas. 

 It should not be inferred, however, from this general statement  that the interior of the central Edifice itself will be converted into a conglomeration  of religious services conducted along lines associated with the traditional procedure  obtaining in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other temples of worship. Its various avenues of approach, all converging towards the central Hall beneath its dome, will not serve as admittance to those sectarian  adherents of rigid formulz and manmade creeds, each bent, according to his way, to observe his rites, recite his prayers, p~rform his ablutions, and display the particular symbols of his faith within separately defined sections of Baha'u'llah's 

Universal House of Worship.

 Far from the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar offering such a spectacle of incoherent  and confused sectarian observances and rites, a condition wholly incompatible with the provisions of the Aqdas and irreconcilable  with the spirit it inculcates, the central House of Baha'i worship, enshrined within the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will gather within its chastened walls, in a serenely spiritual atmosphere, oniy those who, discarding forever the trappings of elaborate and ostentatious ceremony, are willing worshippers of the one true God, as manifested  in this age in the Person of Baha'u'llah.  To them will the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar symbolize the fundamental verity underlying  the Baha'i Faith, that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is not final but progressive. Theirs will be the Conviction that an all-loving  and ever-watchful Father Who, in the past, and at various stages in the evolution  of mankind, has sent forth His Prophets as the Bearers of His Message and the Manifestations of His Light to mankind, cannot at this critical period of their civilization withhold from His children the Guidance which they sorely need amid the darkness which has beset them, and which


<p405>
THE INSTITUTION OF THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR                       405

  neither the light of science nor that of human  intellect and wisdom can succeed in dissipating. And thus having recognized in Baha'u'llah the source whence this celestial light proceeds, they will irresistibly feel attracted  to seek the shelter of His House, and congregate therein, unhampered by ceremonials and unfettered by creed, to render homage to the one true God, the Essence and Orb of eternal Truth, and to exalt and magnify the name of His Messengers and Prophets Who, from time immemorial even unto our day, have, under divers circumstances and in varying measure, mirrored forth to a dark and wayward world the light of heavenly Guidance. 

 But however inspiring the conception of Baha'i worship, as witnessed in the central Edifice of this exalted Temple, it cannot be regarded as the sole, nor even the essential, factor in the part which the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar  as designed by Baha'u'llah, is destined  to play in the organic life of the 

Baha'i community. Divorced  

 from the social, humanitarian, educational and scientific pursuits  centering around the Dependencies of the 

Mashriqu'l-Adhkar Baha'i   

 worship, however exalted in its conception, however passionate in fervor, can never hope to achieve beyond the meager and often transitory  results produced by the contemplations of the ascetic or the communion of the passive worshipper. 

 It cannot afford lasting satisfaction and benefit to the worshipper himself, much less to humanity in general, unless and until translated and transfused into that dynamic and disinterested service to the cause of humanity which it is the supreme privilege of the Dependencies of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to facilitate and promote. 

 Nor will the exertions, no matter how disinterested and strenuous, of those who within the precincts of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar will be engaged in administering the affairs of the future Baha'i Commonwealth, fructify and prosper unless they are brought into close and daily communion with those spiritual agencies centering in and radiating from the central Shrine of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. 

 Nothing short of direct and constant  interaction between the spiritual forces emanating from this House of Worship centering in the heart of the Mashriqu'1-Aclhk6r, and the energies consciously displayed  by those who administer its affairs in their service to humanity can possibly provide the necessary agency capable of removing  the ills that have so long and so grievously afflicted humanity. For it is assuredly upon the consciousness of the efficacy  of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, reinforced  on one hand by spiritual communion with His Spirit, and on the other by the intelligent application and the faithful execution  of the principles and laws He revealed, that the salvation of a world in travail must ultimately depend. And of all the institutions  that stand associated with His Holy Name, surely none save the institution of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar can most adequately provide the essentials of Baha'i worship and service, both so vital to the regeneration of the world. Therein lies the secret of the loftiness, of the potency, of the unique position  of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar as one of the outstanding institutions conceived by Baha'u'llah. 
   Dearly-beloved friends!    

 May we not as the trustees of so priceless a heritage, arise to fulfill our high destiny? 
Haifa, Palestine.

 B~ ARCHDEACON TOWNSHEND, M. A. ON the lake shore at Wilmette stands the completed Temple of Praise, a sign of the Spirit of the Most Great Peace and of the Splendor of God that has come down to dwell among men. 

 The walls of the Temple are transparent, made of an open tracery cut as in sculptured stone, and lined with glass. 

 All imaginable symbols of light are woven together into the pattern, the lights of the sun and the moon and the constellations, the lights of the spiritual heavens unfolded by the great Revealers of today and yesterday, the Cross in various forms, the Crescent and the nine pointed Star (emblem of the Baha'i Faith). No darkness invades the Temple at any time; by day it is lighted by the sun whose rays flood in from every side through the exquisitely  perforated walls, and by night it is artificially illuminated and its ornamented shape is etched with light against the dark. From whatever side the visitor approaches, the aspiring form of the Temple appears as the spirit of adoration; and seen from the air above it has the likeness of a Nine-Pointed  Star come down from heaven to find its resting place on the earth.

                    CHAPTER XXII

          THE RISE AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

                ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER

  significant has been the erection of the superstructure and the completion of the exterior ornamentation of the first Masliri-qu'1-Adhk4r of the West, the noblest of the exploits which have immortalized the services  of the American Baha'i community to the 

Cause of Baha'u'llah.       

 Consummated through the agency of an efficiently functioning  and newly established Administrative Order, this enterprise has itself immensely enhanced the prestige, consolidated the strength and expanded the subsidiary institutions of the community that made its building possible. 

 Conceived forty-one years ago; originating  with the petition spontaneously addressed, dressed, in March 1903 to 'Abdu'l-Baha by the 

"House of Spirituality"    

 of the Baha'is of Chicago — the first Baha'i center established in the 'Western world — the members of which, inspired by the example set by the builders of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 'Ishqabad,  had appealed for permission to construct a similar Temple in America; blessed by His approval and high commendation in a Tablet revealed by Him in June of that same year; launched by the delegates of various American  Assemblies, assembled in Chicago in November, 1907, for the purpose of choosing the site of the Temple; established on a national basis through a religious corporation  known as the ccBah6?i Temple Unity,"

  Members of Baha'i Temple Guides Committee and guides, October, 1944. 

  which was incorporated shortly after the first 

American Baha'i Convention

 held in that same city in March, 1909; honored through the dedication ceremony presided over by !Abdu'l-Baha Himself when visiting that site in May, 1912,~this enterprise —  the crowning achievement of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the first Baha'i century — had, ever since that memorable occasion, been progressing intermittently until the time when the foundations of that Order having been firmly laid in the North American continent the American Baha'i community was in a position to utilize the instruments which it had forged for the efficient prosecution of its task. 

 At the 1914 American Baha'i

 Convention the purchase of the Temple property was completed. The 1920 Convention, held in New York, having been previously directed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to select the design of that Temple, chose from among a number of designs competitively submitted to it that of Louis J. Bourgeois, a French-Canadian architect, a selection that was later confirmed  by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself. The contracts for the sinking of the nine great caissons supporting the central portion of the building, extending to rock at a depth of 120 feet below the ground level, and for the construction of the basement structure, were successively awarded in December, 1920 and August, 1921. In August, 1930, in spite of the prevailing economic crisis, and during a period of unemployment unparalleled  in American history, another contract, with twenty-four additional sub-con-tracts,  for the erection of the superstructure was placed, and the work completed by May 1, 1931, on which day the first devotional service in the new structure was celebrated, coinciding with the 19th anniversary of the dedication of the grounds by 'Abdu'l-Baha. The ornamentation of the dome was started in June, 1932 and finished in January, 1934. The ornamentation of the clerestory was completed in 1935, and that of the gallery unit below it in November, 1938. 

 The mainstory ornamentation was, despite the outbreak of the present war, undertaken in April, 1940, and completed in July, 1942; whilst the eighteen circular steps were placed in position by December, 1942, seventeen months in advance of the centenary celebration  of the Faith, by which time the exterior of the Temple was scheduled to be finished, and forty years after the petition


<p408>
408             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of the Chicago believers had been submitted to and granted by 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 This unique edifice, the first fruit of a slowly maturing Administrative Order, the noblest structure reared in the first Baha'i century, and the symbol and precursor of a future world civilization, is situated in the heart of the North American continent, on the western shore of Lake Michigan, and is surrounded by its own grounds comprising a little less than seven acres. It has been financed, at cost of over a million dollars, by the American Baha'i community, assisted at times by voluntary contributions of recognized  believers in East and West, of Christian, of Muslim, of Jewish, of Zoroastrian,  of Hindu and Buddhist extraction. It has been associated, in its initial phase, with 'Abdu'l-Baha, and in the concluding stages of its construction with the memory of the Greatest 

Holy Leaf, the Purest      
Branch and their mother.   

 The structure itself is a pure white nonagonal building, of original and unique design, rising from a flight, of white stairs encircling its base; and surmounted by a majestic and beautifully proportioned  dome, bearing nine tapering symmetrically placed ribs of decorative as well as structural significance, which soar to its apex and finally merge into a common unit pointing skyward. Its framework is constructed  of structural steel enclosed in concrete, the material of its ornamentation consisting  of a combination of crystalline quartz, opaque quartz and white Portland cement, producing a composition clear in texture, hard and enduring as stone, impervious  to the elements, and cast into a design as delicate as lace. It soars 191 feet from the floor of its basement to the cui-mination of the ribs, clasping the hemispherical  dome which is forty-nine feet high, with an external diameter of ninety feet, and one-third of the surface of which is perforated to admit light during the day and emit light at night. It is buttressed by pylons forty-five feet in height, and bears above its nine entrances, one of which faces 'Akka, nine selected quotations from the writings of Baha'u'llah, as well as the Greatest Name in the center of each of the arches over its doors. It is consecrated exclusively to worship, devoid of all ceremony and ritual, is provided with an auditorium which can seat 1600 people, and is to be supplemented by accessory institutions of social service to be established in its vicinity, such as an orphanage,  a hospital, a dispensary, for the poor, a home for the incapacitated, a hostel for travelers and a college for the study of arts and sciences. 

 It had already, long before its construction, evoked, and is now increasingly evoking, though its interior ornamentation  is as yet unbegun, such interest and comment, in the public press, in technical journals and in magazines, of both the United States and other countries, as to justify the hopes and expectations entertained for it by 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Its model exhibited at Art centers, galleries, state fairs and national expositions — among which may be mentioned the Century of Progress Exhibition, held in Chicago in 1933, where no less than ten thousand people, passing through the Hall of Religions, must have viewed it every day — its replica forming a part of the permanent exhibit of the Museum of 

Science and Industry

 rrwhen the foundation of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is laid in America," 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself has predicted, ~~and that Divine Edifice is completed, a most wonderful and thrilling motion will appear in the' world of existence From that froint of light the spirit of teaching, spreading the Cause of God and promoting the teachings of God, will permeate to all parts of the world." C tQuf of this Mashriqu'l-Adhkar," He has affirmed in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, without doubt, thousands of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar's will be born." ~It marks," He, furthermore,  has written, rrthe inception of the Kingdom of God on earth."

  center of that great continent." 

 !rThousa,sds of Mashriqu'l-Adhkar's" He, when dedicating  the grounds of the Temple, declared, •    will be built in the East and in the West, but this, being the first erected in the Occident, has great importance." reThis organization of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar" He, referring to that edifice, has moreover stated, ~will be a model for the coming centuries, and will hold the station of the mother." 

 "Its inception," the Architect of the Temple has himself testified, "was not from man, for, as musicians, artists, poets receive their inspiration from another realm, so the Temple's architect, through all his years of labor, was ever conscious that Baha'u'llah was the creator of this building to be erected to His glory." 

 ttlnto this new design," be, furthermore, has written, tC is woven, in symbolic form, the great Baha'i teaching of unity — the unity of all religions of all mankind, There are combinations of mathematical  lines, symbolizing those of the universe,  and in their intricate merging of circle into circle, and circle within circle, we visualize  the merging of all the religions into one." And again: ttA circle of steps, eighteen in all, will surround the structure on the outside, and lead to the auditorium floor. These eighteen steps represent the eighteen first disciples of the Bab, and the door to which they lead stands for the Bab Himself." 

 "As the essence of the pure original teachings of the historic religions was the same in the Baha'i Temple is used a composite architecture, expressing the essence  in the line of each of the great architectural  styles, harmonizing them into one whole." 

 cdt is the first new idea in architecture since the 13th century," declared a distinguished  architect, H. Van Buren Magonigle, President of the Architectural League, after gazing upon a plaster model of the Temple on exhibition in the Engineering Societies Building in New York, in June 1920. "The Architect," he, moreover, has stated, tthas conceived a Temple of Light in which structure, as usually understood, is to be concealed,  visible support eliminated as far as possible, and the whole fabric to take on the airy substance of a dream. It is a lacy envelope  enshrining an idea, the idea of light, a shelter of cobweb interposed between earth and sky, struck through and through with light — light which shall partly consume the forms and make of it a thing of faery." 

 C(J~ the geometric forms of the ornamentation," a writer in the wellknown publication  Architectural Record has written, ttcovering the columns and surrounding windows and doors of the Temple, one deciphers  all the religious symbols of the world. Here are the swastika, the circle, the cross, the triangle, the double triangle or six pointed star (Solomon's seal) — but more than this — the noble symbol of the spiritual orb the five pointed star; the Greek Cross, the Roman cross, and supreme above all, the wonderful nine pointed star, figured in the structure of the Temple itself, and appearing again and again in its ornamentation as significant of the spiritual glory in the world today." 

 "The greatest creation since the Gothic period," is the testimony of George Grey Barnard, one of the most widely-known sculptors in the United States of America, "and the most beautiful I have ever seen." 

 (clvInTh is a new creation," Prof. Luigi Quaglino, ex-professor of Architecture from Turin declared, after viewing the model, "which will revolutionize architecture in the world, and it is the most beautiful I have ever seen. Without doubt it will have a lasting page in history. It is a revelation from another world." 

     "Americans," wrote Sherwin 

 Cody, in the magazine section of the New York Times, of the model of the Temple, when exhibited in the Kevorkian Gallery in New York, !cwill have to pause long enough to find that an artist has wrought into this building the conception of a Religious League of Nations."  And lastly, this tribute paid to the features of, and the ideals embodied in, this Temple — the most sacred House of Worship in the Baha'i world, whether of the present or of the future — by Dr. Rexford New-comb,  Dean of the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois:

              THE BAHA'IS AND THEIR TEMPLE
              OF WORSHIP              

  Reprinted from the Chicago Sunday Tribune, June 17, 1945 A Tribune color studio photo of the Baha'i temple of worship at Wilmette, Ill. taken at night under the illumination of artificial lights, appears on rage one of the Picture Section of this issue of The 

Tribune.                  

  A GREAT white dome of sugary delicacy lifts into the sky above Wilmette, ILL Like the beautiful Taj Mahal, it is oriental in feeling  and yet classical in its unique nine-sided base, and of a serene, cosmopolitan majesty. 

 It is the Baha temple of worship. 

 Perhaps you have seen it while driving northward from Chicago up the shore of Lake Michigan. Perhaps you have wondered what it means — who built it, and why. 

 The truth is an amazing story. The temple is in appreciable part a gift from the people of Persia. 

 Much has been heard of American charity toward the east, but who ever heard of the east sending money to the west? 

 The story really begins in far-off Persia in the year 1844, when a new messiah was announced to a bewildered and unbelieving world. 
His name was Baha'u'llah — meaning "the

Glory of God."            

 Baha'u'llah's life was like those of earlier prophets in many ways. Not oniy did he suffer long persecution, which seemed to stimulate his spirit, but his coming was heralded  by a precursor, who has been compared with 

John the Baptist.         

 The forerunner was a direct descendant of Mohammed and called himself the Bib (the Gate). At the age of 2i, in 1844, he suddenly felt a divine command upon him. He spread the news, and 18 disciples who had Ioined him were sent by him to different parts of ,Per.sia and Turkestan to proclaim thc imminent appearance of the new messiah. The Bab himself went to Mecca, where he proclaimed the new faith to the Mohammedan  kader, who rejected the BTh's authority, symbolizing the turning of Islam's back on the new religion. 

 As the years went on the alarm and hatred in the hearts of the orthodox and of government  officials caused more and more ruthless suppression of the Mb and his disciples. Houses of the BTh's many believers were pillaged  and destroyed. 

 Women were seized and carried off and thousands of believers were put to death. Many were beheaded, hanged, blown from the mouths of cannon, burned, or chopped to pieces. And yet the response to the Bib's teachings increased. 

 Finally on July 9, 1850, the Bib himself, then 31, fell a victim to the fanatical fury of his persecutors. At the time of this martyrdom Mirza Husayn 'Au was well known as one of the most fearless exponents of the new faith. He came of a wealthy and distinguished family in the capital city, Teheran, and he possessed an almost unbelievable power of attraction which was felt by all who knew him. His face had a look of profound wisdom, and even at the age of 13 he had often been known to discuss intricate religious questions in large gatherings in such a way as to hold his listeners in awed silence. 

 After suffering a severe imprisonment in a dungeon because of his unorthodox convictions,  and once the torture of the bastinado  — caning on the soles of the feet —  Mirza Musayn 'Au had a dream in which a voice told him he was to be the great prophet announced by the Bab and thru '*hom the


<p412>
412             THE BAHA'! WORLD

  Holy Spirit would be made manifest on earth. 
     He assumed the title of    

Baha'u'llah (Glory of God)  

 and began to teach all who came to him about the new faith. After being exiled to Mesopotamia by the shah he spent two years in lonely meditation in the wilderness.  Later he was sent to Turkey, and from there to 'Akka in the Holy Land, thus fulfilling  in 1868, believe his followers, a prophecy made in both the Old and New Testaments. 

 During all this time Baha'u'llah wrote and taught with astounding wisdom and with a factual knowledge far beyond his apparent education and which his disciples attributed to his being the direct mouthpiece  of God. His understanding of things in the western world, totally alien to his surroundings, was amazing, and he wrote a series of letters to the principal crowned heads of Europe, the pope, the $li&h of Persia, and the President of the United States, announcing his divine mission and calling on them to help establish true religion, just government, and international peace. 

 Baha'u'llah taught evolution, equal rights for women, prohibition of intoxicating liquors, free universal education, the abolition  of begging, and government relief for the poor. And, adapting Christian principles to modern conditions, he strongly advocated the uniting of people of all races, religions, nationalities, classes, languages, and customs into a peaceful, harmonious world community. 

 After he died in 1892 at the age of 75 his son and successor, 'Abdu'l-Baha (Servant of Bah&), became by his will the interpreter and exemplar of the faith. 

 In the years since Baha'u'llah died his faith has been spreading siowiy but steadily — much in the manner of Christianity in its first century. In the early days of the new religion "many thousands" of the believers perished as martyrs. Today the Baha'is number nearly a million in Persia. 

 In Turkestan,  in America, in India and Burma they are to be counted by the thousand, while in France, Switzerland, Italy, and even in Germany they are reported to have centers and to be making headway. 

 Chicago, centrally situated and from which the Columbian exposition in 1893 launched the new faith in the new world, was Logically chosen as the site of the first American Baha house of worship. 

 And so the devoted Baha'is all over the world —  most of them in Persia (Iran) — chipped in, and that is where the great white temple in Wilmette came from. 

 When the temple with its surroundings at Wilmette is completed it will include a hospital and dispensary, a school for orphan children, a hospice, a college for higher scientific education, and beautiful gardens and fountains between the outlying buildings  and the temple. 

 There is no classical term of architecture to describe the temple. 

 It is unique among structures, aitho in it one may recognize characteristics of widely separated lands and civilizations. 

 In the delicate tracery of its ornamental exterior, viewed as a whole and not closely analyzed, and in certain of its arches, the oriental influence may be observed. In the outline of the great windows of its gallery is a suggestion of the Gothic. Students of architecture have identified in the design touches of Egyptian, Greek, Romanesque, Arabic, Gothic, renaissance, and modern. 

 Land for the project was acquired between  1908 and 1912. Actual work began in 191 8 with the sinking of nine great steel and concrete caissons reaching 120 feet to bedrock. 

 The number nine, beginning with the caissons, has been repeated thruout the imposing nonagon from the base to the apex of the ribs of its vast dome. 

 With caissons and foundation structure completed, it was necessary to suspend operations  while funds were collected for the superstructure. 

 In April, 1931, the superstructure was finished. In 1935 the clerestory  (windowed point directly beneath the dome) was completed, and in 1937 and 1938 final touches were given to the gallery section. 

 Since 1938 the nine pylons and nine faces of the main story have been finished. 

 Before construction was stopped for the war's duration in 1942, circular steps leading  to the nine outside doors were corn pleted — the last exterior work remaining. Four or five years of work remain to be done on the interior. 

 The completion of the ex

  tenor ornamentation by May, 1944, the Baha centenary, was one of the three tasks undertaken by American believers in 1937. The other two — also successfully carried out — were the formation of a Baha'i assembly in each state and Canadian province, and establishment of Baha'i groups in every South and Central American country. 

 Including $40,000 for the steps, about $1,500,000 has been spent on the temple. Major items included: Land, $125,000; caissons, $200,000; superstructure, $400,000; external decorations for the dome, $170,000; gallery section, $125,000; grading, $1 5,000; tunnels and areaways, $10,000 and first floor ornamentation, $175,000. Construction has proceeded as money became available; the faith does not approve of mortgages. 

 The temple's diameter is 202 feet to the outside of the stairs. The interior diameter is 153 feet. 

 It is 135 feet from the main floor to the ceiling of the dome, which itself has an interior diameter of 75 feet. The dome has outer and inner shells of glass, supports of steel and aluminum, and outer ornamentation — four layers in all. 

 There is a story connected with the external  ornamentation. 

 Designs were prepared by Architect Louis Bourgeois, who spent 20 years on plans for the temple. 

 (He died at Wilmette Aug. 19, 1930, at the age of 74, without having seen the building rise above its foundation.) But there was no practical method of executing the designs satisfactorily except at prohibitive cost. Made of metal, the ornaments would have needed upkeep thru the centuries to prevent possible corrosion. Carved of stone — an excessively costly process — they would have lacked the desired flowing lines. 

 John J. Earley, an architectural sculptor of Washington, D. C., was called upon when the problem appeared insoluble. A master craftsman, Earley had collaborated with Lorado Taft, late Chicago sculptor, on the Fountain of Time which stands at the Midway entrance to Washington park on Chicago's  south side. His other achievements included a reproduction of the Parthenon in Nashville, Tenn.; beautiful buildings of the University of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, the Church of the Sacred Heart in Washington,  and the Thomas A. Edison memorial tower at Menlo Park, N. J. Earley made it possible, with a cement method, to carry out the designs. 

Translating  the Bourgeois

 plans into curved surfaces and giving them depth, he produced clay models from which plaster molds were made. 

 Into the molds was poured a mixture of white cement and ground quartz. Hardening around a core of reinforcing steel, each casting was cured and then polished by hand. Some of these decorative units were as long as 2 5 feet. They emerged with more delicate lines than carved stone and are stronger than any natural stone except the hardest types of granite. 

 The Bab4'is plan eventually to construct a house of worship in every city, to symbolize  their conception of the universality of true faith. The Baha'i community includes representatives of all races, classes, nationalities,  and creeds. 
                          
                 A NEW ttTAJ MAHAL"

  ANOTHER adventure in beauty with white cement is the remarkable Baha'i Tem-pie on the shore of Lake Michigan at Wil-mette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The concrete superstructure of the building is covered with precast lace-like Architectural Concrete Slabs made with glistening quartz aggregates set off in a matrix of Atlas White cement and reinforced with steel. Although lace-like in style, the strength is adequate, and the large dome is relatively thinner than an eggshell. This building, the outgrowth of a movement for a temple inaugurated in 1903, was designed by the late Louis Bourgeois, of Wilmette, formerly of West Englewood,  N. J. Construction began in the latter year and was resumed in 1929 after a lapse in the Twenties. 

The Architectural Concrete

 Slabs were executed by Mr. Earley. The estimate for doing the job in concrete was one-tenth that of the estimated cost in natural stone.

414             THE BA}-IA'1 WORLD

  The dome of the temple, finished in 1934, was described in the Chicago Tribune, as the seventh largest in the world. 

 It comes after the Pantheon in Rome, St. Peter's in Rome, Duomo Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, Santa Sophia in Constantinople,  St. Paul's in London, and the United States Capitol in Washington. 

 The Baha'i dome is 93 feet in diameter, which is three feet less than that of the rotunda in Washington. It is one foot larger than that of the Invalides in Paris, where Napoleon Bonaparte lies. 

 The external decoration of the remainder of the building has now been completed. This work, although differing in design and significance, is kindred in its white serenity to the Taj Mahal at Agra, India, often called the "world's most beautiful building."

               THE ARCHITECT'S DESIGN

                    EARL H. REED

  THE design and construction of the Baha'i Temple conveys an impression of deep and sincere religious conviction. Like the Dome of the Rock in the Mosque court at Jerusalem, on the site of Abraham's sacrifice and the Temple of Solomon; like the pillared holy places of Egypt, Greece and Rome; like 

Amiens and St. Peter's     

 and even resembling  the solidity of Moses' mountain, it signifies the Divine aspirations of mankind. 

 Here rich symbolic elements of fine and staunch material have been skillfully interwoven  to form an impressive mass which unmistakably tells the Baha'i story in terms of Architecture. 

 Accomplishment of this end was the dominant task of Louis J. Bourgeois, the Architect. And he met it well, as one performing a prolonged act of faith. 

 So expressive is the structure that this observer has been largely able to derive from it his limited understanding of the philosophical  and religious background from which it emerged. It affords striking example  of effective cooperation of those who build with those for whom they build. Some tC11~~ has indeed been cast over the enterprise. 

 A definite program, so essential in any building process, was presented, comprehended,  and is in process of realization in a manner not often seen in this age of overnight construction "miracles." 

 The program  is broad, fresh and vital — and so is its architectural answer. 

 But what of the needs stated in this program? 
The Book of Laws said,     

"Construct                 

 edifices in the most beautiful manner possible";  the Guardian said that around the central edifice, C C~sha11 cluster — institutions of social service," and, "higher scientific education", but "the central building will be devoted solely — to prayer and worship", that it, "must have nine si&s, doors, fountains,  paths, gateways, columns, and gardens  " — "with the ground floor, galleries and domes." 

 And finally, cCThus science will be the handmaid of religion, both showering their material and spiritual gifts on all humanity." 

 Such are the bare outlines of a noble architectural program. 

 During forty years, so much of it has been accomplished in a planned and orderly fashion, as to leave little doubt but that in good time, the complete vision will be actualized. By 1944, as required, the fabric has been erected and the exterior finished as well. 

 The manner of doing has called forth admiration on every side. Without world wide support and sacrifice this would not have been possible — many, like the humble  shopman in distant India who gave his sleeping mat, have contributed in free will fashion. 

 Hundreds of minds and hands have been utilized in the building of the Temple —  Architects', Engineers', Builders', Sculptors', skilled 

Craftsmen's and Labourers'.

 Last but not least the members of the Faith itself, acting through their democratically constituted  Executive Committee should be mentioned, numbering five thousand active workers in North America alone. Each has

  Mr. Earl H. Reed, guest speaker on May 19, 1944, for the Centenary program dedicated to the "Universal House of 'Worship." Mr. Reed's address was entitled "The Architect's 

                      Design."

  had a share in developing this important regional home of a universal religious concept. 

 By 1909 the Wilmette site had been purchased.  It is admirably suited to effective carrying out of the central portion of the program. Free views are afforded of the nine sided structure from many directions and it is displayed to full advantage. Processes of architectural planning have been adequate to produce a satisfying mass and at the same time a functional result. 

 The first floor was wisely raised high above Lake Michigan and adjoining streets so that the dome, soaring one hundred sixty-one feet above it, becomes a landmark of great distinction, dominating the region. 

 This also made possible the securing of extensive floor areas in the ground floor for auditorium, radiating  alcoves and utilities, without destroying the simple and powerful effect of the domed Hall of Worship. Technological advances  in ventilation, air conditioning and lighting have greatly extended the potentialities  for use of this subterranean space. 

 This observer well remembers first seeing, about 1920, the large plaster model of the Temple which had been prepared to present the architect's conception. 

 Like many fellow  architects he was struck by the origi


<p416>
416             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  nality of the design and the bold beauty of the dome. A fine design inevitably undergoes  processes of modification and refinement during its developmental stages. The Temple was no exception. The thinning down of its girth at the behest of 'Abdu'l-Baha  was an act of technical intelligence, which at one stroke assured a soaring grace to the structure, eliminated unneeded space and reduced costs of construction to a practicable  basis. 

 The same doubts assailed this observer as many others regarding the novel axial relationship of the inviting segmented entrances  with the central mass behind — for passage to the Hall of Worship is effected directly toward and through each of the nine, four pointed bases, of the superstructure  supports. 

 But rigid technical investigation and the judgment of passing time have confirmed the correctness of this disposition of the encircling entrance vestibule mass. Through it the edifice gains a most unusual quality of aliveness. 

 He remarked year by year, the successive steps of construction — the sinking of the caisson wells to bedrock in 1921, the completion  of the fort-like lower portion containing the auditorium, and then of upper portions and the galleries. Finally the dome itself was raised and received its distinguished ornamentation. 

 Not until recently did close examination reveal to this observer that the best known building methods and materials had been applied to assure long life and continued comeliness to this unique structure. 

 In common with other religious buildings, Baha'i Temple includes in its composition many symbolisms. Intertwined curved forms signifying cosmic unity; the out-giving meanings of the many fine sculptured pierced openings; sides numbered to the greatest digit for nine world religions and eighteen encircling steps; inwrought swastika, cross, crescent and star; carved utterances such as ttThc earth is but one country and mankind its citizens." Diverse motives of historic styles have been employed. High flung, above all, are the pointed segmental ribs of the dome, lending spiritual character to the whole in a fashion heretofore untried. 

 A beautiful design ignobly executed would have constituted a negation of the principles underlying the Ba1A'i Faith. But the Temple structure, a work of the late Major H. J. Burt, was skillfully and solidly designed in harmony with the architect's intent.  The Hall of Worship, though incomplete,  is already impressive with its exposed, rhythmical, concrete members. Such stark structure is much admired by moderns today. 

 Yet the practical policies adopted for the Temple, require that it be clothed in richer material to bring human scale to its vast volume and an atmosphere of divine worship through subtly controlled lighting, modulated space enclosure, and color. 

 The architectural committee, of which Mr. Allen B. McDaniel has long been a member,  made a most fortunate move when it chose for the exterior, the brilliant white, cast-concrete product, of the Earley Studio. How its quartz aggregate was developed and the steps of its modelling, casting and ingenious attachment to the structure were worked out form a fascinating chapter of the history of the building of the Temple. This observer is not aware of the existence of a finer example of cast-concrete application  than the present one. By way of appraisal, one has only to examine the perfection  of the encircling steps, each laid onehalf inch from the next for drainage, and allowance for expansion, as are all other cast sections. In the dome they are ten feet square in places, carefully reinforced with steel, here as everywhere else, and they weigh up to three and onehalf tons. As completion stages are entered upon, many complex problems  of material selection will be encountered  — may the committee be equally successful  with these. 

 In the not too distant future, judging from the astonishing growth rate of membership  in the Faith, numerous other architectural  problems of more general nature must also be met and solved. 

 For instance that of a landscape setting in order to merge the monumental domed mass of the Temple into its small scale suburban location; the arranging of entrance approaches and most important of all, the location and disposition of social service and educational elements in completion of the ensemble. That decisions  in these matters will be wisely made as to order and method, also seems certain.

418             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  No attempt has or will be made here to attach a label of historic style to Baha'i Temple. It is vital and universal in spirit, befittingly Oriental in its intricacy of treatment, and the dome ornament is vigorously modern. 

 A modest statement by the architect  contains this passage, t~th structural lines which originated in the faith of all religions are the same but so covered over are they with decoration picturing creed upon creed and superstition after superstition,  that we must needs lay them aside and create a new form of ornament." Thus did be succeed in weaving into the Temple a notable expression of "unity of all religious mankind," creating thereby a monument to universal peace among men. 

 Louis J. Bourgeois passed away just before the starting of the work on the superstructure in 1930. He had completed his design, including fullsized drawings of remarkable accuracy, we are told. Some reached a length of one hundred nine feet and involved tremendous  effort. From his studio home on Lake Michigan, just east of the Temple, he had hoped to enjoy the supreme satisfaction of an architect — that of viewing day by day, the progressive realization of his architectural dreams. 

 French Canadian by birth and trained in Paris, he had assisted Louis II. Sullivan, the Chicago master, and other architects, erected churches in Canada, and participated in the Hague Peace Palace competition during an active professional life. He was a member of the Baha'i Faith and the design of the Temple was his culminating work. 

 In its interest and in order to consult with the Leader of the Faith, he made a pilgrimage to Palestine where he left some original drawings. 

 His vivid spirit lives on within these walls which he never saw. A fellow architect  feels it a privilege to pay Louis J. Bourgeois tribute on the occasion of the Centenary of the Baha Faith which he served so well. 

 Address delivered on the program of the Baha'i Centenary, May 1925, 1944. 
                           
                  THE BAHA'I TEMPLE

  ON the shores of Lake Michigan in the beautiful suburb of Wilmette, 14 miles north of Chicago, stands one of the most imposing and unusual edifices in America. This is the Baha'i House of Worship, better known as Baha'i Temple, designed by Louis Jcan Bourgeois. It is the second temple of the worldwide religious faith, the first having  been constructed in Ishqabad, Russia, early in this century. The faith originated in Persia some 100 years ago, and is named after Baha'u'llah, a Persian of noble family who died in 1892 at 'Akka, Palestine, after 40 years of exile and imprisonment. 

 His eldest son, 'Abdu'l-Baha, came from the Holy Land westward, first through Egypt and then to Europe and America in 1912 and 1913, speaking in many churches and universities. 

 He laid stress on the principles of independent search for truth: the oneness of mankind; the abolition of racial, patriotic, political and religious prejudices; universal peace; the harmony of science and religion; the essential oneness of all religions; the betterment of morals; economic righteousness s and justice; universal education; and the equality of men and women. The Tern-pie  has been dedicated to these principles and has been built by people in all lands who are working for these principles. 

 It is open to all religions, sects and peoples. 

 So unusual in conception and complicated in design was the project, the architect did not risk presentation by drawings alone but at the time designs were being considered by the building committee he submitted a beautiful white plaster model of the entire structure. 

 H. Van Buren Magonigle, architect  of New York City, upon examination of the model gave the following description of the temple: ~tMr. Bourgeois has conceived a Temple of Light in which structure as usually understood  is to be concealed, visible support eliminated as far as possible, and the whole fabric to take on the airy substance of a dream; it is a lacy envelope enslirining an idea, the idea of light, a shelter of cobweb interposed between earth and sky, struck through and through with light — light

  which shall partly consume the forms and make it a thing of faery." 

 Symbolic of the principles of the Baha'i caus~ are the geometric forms of the ornamentation  covering the columns and surrounding windows and doors of the temple. Here are the circle, the triangle, the double triangle or six-pointed star, the five-pointed star, the Greek cross, the Roman or Christian cross, the swastika cross and the nine-pointed star. The figure 9, largest digit, recurs not only in the ornament but in the structure itself. 

 In designing this structure the architect refused to let himself be bound by common practices. He knew it would be impracticable to use a material that required cutting and carving to give him the pierced and highly ornamented surfaces he visioned and that a material which could be molded such as concrete or metal was especially adapted to such work. The prolect was built over a period of some 20 years as funds became available. This permitted ample time for investigation of materials proposed for the exterior surface before a decision had to be made. The caissons on which the building is supported were completed in 1921, the basement in 1922. The superstructure was not started until 1930. During this period samples of various materials were placed on the property to test their durability, weathering  and discoloration. 

 The architect had met and interested John J. Earley of the Earley Studio, Washington, D. C., in the project and Mr. Earley submitted a fullsize sample of the dome ornamentation cast in concrete with a surface of exposed aggregate. It was found that the design with its intricate ornamentation and repetition of forms and details was especially adapted to concrete, plastic when placed and becoming durable and strong upon hardening. 

 The edifice rests upon a great circular platform which constitutes the basement. The basement wall is 204-ft. 8-in, outside diameter. A central basement space 72 ft. in diameter and 27 ft. high, free from interior  columns and having a domed ceiling, was used for regular services during the years additional funds were being raised and the superstructure was being built. Corn-pletely letely surrounding the building is a series of 18 steps supported on the sloping deck of the basement. The first story of the superstructure is a nine-sided unit, each side constituting an entrance arch buttressed by pyions or towers. The nine symmetrical sides form a series of concave arcs intersecting the line of the circle marked by the towers. Above the main story are the gallery, the clerestory and the dome. The gallery unit, likewise nine-sided, sets back from the main story. It repeats the effect of the entrance  arches below in its series of nine window arches, but the nine smaller towers of this level rise at points midway between the lower towers. The clerestory and dome, set back from the outer line of the gallery, form circles and not nonagons but their circumference is divided into nine convex arcs by nine ribs. These spring from the base of the clerestory to meet above the dome and coincide vertically with the towers of the gallery. 

 The main auditorium is a clear circular opening 72 ft. in diameter and 105 ft. high above the main floor surmounted by the dome 36 ft. in radius. There are no intermediate  floors, the galleries circumscribing the open space. 

 Nine concrete caissons or piers 6 ft. in diameter were sunk to bedrock at 1 24 ft. Each pier is flared at the top to carry a steel grillage supporting four steel columns which support the dome and also portions of the galleries and first-floor framing. The dome s inner and outer system of framing are independent  and not connected in any way, so that unequal expansion and contraction will not affect the structure. 

 The inner framing supports a waterproof dome of wire glass and will eventually support an ornamental interior dome. The outside framing supports the pierced cast stone exterior dome. 

 Backup of all exterior walls and pyions is of reinforced concrete cast in place. Due to the unusual shapes involving the curved walls and arches over the windows as well as the curved surfaces of the pylon; considerable formwork of a complicated nature was required. All forms for the cast-in-place backup walls wee constructed of wood. At the time the walls were constructed it was

  not known when it would be possible to place the exterior decorative material. 

 The concrete was therefore carefully controlled to withstand severe weathering indefinitely. Workability was varied in relation to the size and shape of members. There are columns and mullions from 30 to 47 ft. high, and some sections only 4 in. thick. 

 Increased workability was obtained where necessary by reducing the amount of coarse aggregate. Aggregates and concrete were tested at frequent  intervals to control their quality. 

 As it turned out these walls were exposed for periods from three years to over 1 0 years but in no case did they show any effects of weathering. 

 The untimely death of the architect occurred about the time construction on the superstructure was started. He had, however,  completed his design including fullsized drawings of all exterior ornamentation,  great drawings of remarkable beauty and accuracy, some reaching a length of 109 ft. Mr. Earley worked over the archi tect's designs of ornamentation, which were in the flat, and simplified certain details as a result of his studies of their final effect in depth. 

 The first step was the modeling and carving of the original clay model for each section. The sculptor made a tracing of the architect's original fullsized drawing £ or each surface and then transferred this design on to the clay surface. 

 From this outline he modeled and carved the fullsize clay model. Plaster of paris impressions were taken of the clay surfaces and from these a plaster of paris model, well reinforced  with hemp, jute and steel rods, was made. The plaster model was then carefully carved to give the final surface texture and modeling. 

 From the model, plaster of paris molds were made which provided the negative of the final cast section. 

 All precast  members were made in a plant at Ross-lyn, 

Va.                        

 In the lower section of the dome the precast sections are about 10 ft. square, S in. thick and weigh between 3 and 3¼ tons

  each. Near the top of the dome the sections are about 3x10 ft. Each concrete section is separated from the adjacent sections by '/2 in. spaces, allowing room for each to expand, contract and move without affecting the others. 

 While most of the ornamented facing on the lower stories is also precast, some of the plainer surfaces such as around the windows and lower sections of the flY-Ions  were cast in place. Plaster molds were used for these areas also and the same materials used for the concrete as in the precast work. 

 All surface concrete is of the exposed  aggregate type produced by brushing and washing to reveal the aggregate. Aggregates are white crystalline quartz and a clear translucent quartz, crushed and carefully screened and proportioned to exact grading. White portland cement was used in the surface. The surfaces are extremely pleasing and full of life due to the scintillating effect of the quartz. 

 The final stage was production and erection  of the 1 8 circular steps at the base of the structure. 

 These consist of 91 8 precast sections and are continuous around the building.  A better conception of the amount involved can be had when it is realized that they are equivalent to a single step about two miles long. 

 They were placed on concrete carriages cast on the sloping deck of the basement. 

 Every operation in the production of the decorative concrete was closely controlled to produce a structure meeting the requirements  of the members of the Baha'i faith who look upon their temple as a building which is to last indefinitely. 

 The vision of the architect has materialized and what many technical men had deemed im~racti-cable when they viewed the model in 1920 has become a reality.

              FLOODLIGHTING THE TEMPLE

THE Baha'i House of Worship

 in Wil-mette,  Illinois, has frequently been referred to as the Temple of Light. 

 This descriptive appellation may have been inspired by the lacy stone ornamental surfaces which reflect the sun rays in an ever changing pattern, or the effect of the light within the structure,  which is unique because the perforations in the outer envelope of stone permit the infiltration of the sunlight. 

 The unique beauty of the structure itself, standing above its surroundings, the inspiring  sweep of lines that delineate its majestic form, the general theme of its graceful forms that conceal its size, but which stagger up to massive proportions, call forth from all who see it, expressions of awe and wonder. It is so utterly unlike the common concept of a building as to, at first, seem almost unreal, yet it exerts a singular power of attraction that draws to its portals a steady stream of visitors who seek almost involuntarily to enter and to learn its meaning. 

 The simile of light and truth has always been a part of the human expression of religious concept. 

 The Teachings of the Prophets, the great Founders of the world religions, were commonly called the Light of God. The use of light combined with the structural elements of the Baha House of Worship was a basic concept of its designer,  hence the ornamental form which, because of the deep carving of the surface, reveals the ornament in deep relief, so that the ever changing play of light and shadow creates a form poem of singular charm and impressive beauty. 

 As the sunlight moves over its surfaces from dawn to sunset, and as it stands silhouetted against the ever changing sky and the cloud pattern, it inspires ever new feelings  of wonderment and awe. Not, however, until at the time of the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the foundation  of the Faith, when the trustees undertook  to make the first experiment with artificial lighting of the exterior of the building was the truly exquisite ethereal character of the whole structure revealed. The lighting installations were oniy temporary  and therefore in no sense perfect. 

 The equipment used was oniy roughly adapted


<p423>
423

      THE INSTITUTION OF THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR

  to the purpose, yet the effect was simply astounding. 

 A feeling of unreality, of a building that was not of the earth, but which seemed to be a vision, overpowered every one. 

 It arrested the step of every person, no one could walk past without stopping again and again to gaze at it. The entire form glowed as though made of luminous  material and there was a feeling of vibration that seemed to make it alive. 

 The very fact that this effect could be obtained by equipment so inadequate gives promise of a future development that may in itself become most significant. 

 In this experiment it was found impossible to actually illuminate the dome of the structure. This was due partly to the nature of the equipment found available in this war period  and to the curve of the surfaces of the dome. 

 There is every reason to believe that this will not prove to be an insolvable problem and one may be assured that in the not too far distant future the fully illumined  House of Worship will stand in the night as well as in the day time, a powerful beacon to guide mankind toward the Faith of Baha'u'llah.

BAHA'I CALENDAR, FESTIVALS AND
           DATES OF HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE
                      FOREWORD

  B~ DR. J. E. ESSLEMONT 

          From Baha'u'llah and the New Era

  AMONG different peoples and at different  times many different methods have been adopted for the measurement of time and fixing of dates, and several different calendars  are still in daily use, e.g., the Gregorian in Western Europe, the Julian in many countries  of Eastern Europe, the Hebrew among the Jews, and the Muhammadan in Muslim countries. 

 The BTh signalized the importance of the dispensation which He came to herald, by inaugurating a new calendar. 

 In this, as in the Gregorian Calendar, the lunar month is abandoned and the solar year is adopted. 

 The Baha'i year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e., 361 days), with the addition  of certain ttintercalary days" (four in ordinary and five in leap years) between the eighteenth and nineteenth months in order to adjust the calendar to the solar year. The B~b named the months after the attributes of God. 

 The Bab4'i New Year, like the ancient Persian New Year, is astronomically fixed, commencing at the March equinox (March 21), and the Baha'i era commences with the year of the Bib's declaration (i.e., 1844 A.D., 1260 A.H.). In the not far distant future it will be necessary that all peoples in the world agree on a common calendar. 

 It seems, therefore, fitting that the new age of unity should have a new calendar free from the objections and associations which make each of the older calendars unacceptable  to large sections of the world's population,  and it is difficult to see how any other arrangement could exceed in simplicity and convenience that proposed by the 13Th.

  NOTE: 'Abdu'l-Baha, in one of His Tablets addressed to a believer of Nayriz, Persia, has written the following: "Nine days in the year have been appointed on which work is forbidden. Some of these days have been specifically mentioned in the Book. The rest follows as corollaries to the Text. Work on the Day of the Covenant (Fete Day of 'Abdu'l-Baha), however, is not prohibited. Celebration n of that day is left to the discretion of the friends. Its observation is not obligatory. The days pertaining to the AbhA Beauty (Baha'u'llah) and the Primal Point (the B~b), that is to say these nine days, are the oniy ones on which work connected with trade, commerce, industry and agriculture is not allowed. In like manner, work connvcted with any form of employment, whether governmental or otherwise, should be suspended." 

 As a corollary of this Tablet it follows that the anniversaries of the birth and ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha are not to be regarded as days on which work is prohibited. 
. The celebration of these two days, however, is obligatory.

 Baha'is in East and West, holding administrative positions, whether public or private, should exert the utmost effort to obtain special leave from their superiors to enable them to observe these nine holy days.

   ING THE BAHA'I CALENDAR

 The Badi' Calendar (Baha'i Calendar) has been taken by me from the Kitab-i-Aqdas', one of the works written by the Mb. As I have observed in these days that certain believers are inclined to regard the year in which Baha'u'llah departed from BaghdAd to Constantinople as marking the beginning of the Badi' Calendar, I have requested Mirza Aq~ JAn, the amanuensis of Baha'u'llah, u'114h, to ascertain His will and desire concerning cerning this matter. Baha'u'llah answered and said: tThe year sixty A.H. (1844 A.D.), the 'rear of the Declaration of the Mb, must 

                                       FROM

 be regarded as the beginning of the Badi' Calendar.' The Declaration of the Bab took place on the evening preceding the fifth day of Jam~diyu'1-Avva1, of the year 1260 A.14. 

 It has been ordained that the solar calendar be followed, and that the vernal Equinox, the day of Nawruz, be regarded as the 

                     New Year's Day of the Badi' Calendar. The

                  dar. As in that year, the day of Naw-Ritz,

 the vernal Equinox, preceded by sixty-six days the date of the Declaration of the Bib, I have therefore, throughout my history, regarded  the Naw-Riiz of the year sixty-one A.H. (the Nawruz immediately following the Declaration of the Bib) as the first Naw-Riiz of the Badi' Calendar. 

 I have accordingly considered the Naw-Riiz of this present year, the year 1306 A.H., which is the 47th solar year after the Declaration of the Bib, as the 46th Naw-Rfiz of the Badi' Calendar.

428             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The first day of each month is thus the day of Ba1A, and the last day of each month the day of 'AI&. 

 The BTh has regarded the solar year, of 365 days, 5 hours, and fifty odd minutes, as consisting of 19 months of 19 days each, with the addition of certain intercalary days. He has named the New Year's Day, which is the Day of Nawruz, the day of Bah4, of the month of Baha. He has ordained the month of 'AU' to be the month of fasting, and has decreed that the day of Naw-Ri2iz should mark the termination of that period. As the BTh did not specifically define the place for the four days and the fraction of a day in the Badi' Calendar, the people of the Baydn were at a ioss as to how they should regard them. The revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas  in the city of 'Akka resolved this problem and settled the issue. Baha'u'llah designated those days as the "Ayyim-i-H&' and ordained that they should immediately precede the month of 'AU', which is the month of fasting. 

 He enjoined upon His followers to devote these days to feasting, rejoicing, and charity. Immediately upon the termination of these intercalary days, Baha'u'llah ordained the month of fasting to begin. I have heard it stated that some of the people of the Baydn, the followers of Mirza Yahy~, have regarded these intercalary  days as coming immediately after the month of 'AU', thus terminating their fast five days before the day of Naw-Riiz. 

 This, notwithstanding the explicit text of the Baydn which states that the day of Naw-Riiz must needs be the first day of the month of Baha, and must follow immediately after the last day of the month of 'AU'. Others, aware of this contradiction, have started their fasting on the fifth day of the month of 'AU', and included the intercalary  days within the period of fasting. 

 Every fourth year the number of the intercalary days is raised from four to five. The day of Nawruz falls on the 21st of March oniy if the vernal Equinox precedes the setting of the sun on that day. 

 Should the vernal Equinox take place after sunset, Naw-Riiz will have to be celebrated on the following day. 

 The Bab has, moreover, in His writings, revealed in the Arabic tongue, divided the years following the date of His Revelation, into cycles of nineteen years each. The names of the years in each cycle are as follows: 1.     Alif     A. 2.     BA'     B. 3.     Ab     Father. 

 4.     DAI     D. 5.     Bab     Gate. 

 6.     W.v     V. 7.     Abad     Eternity. 
     8.     J~d     Generosity. 
     9.     Bah4     Splendor.  
     10.     Hubb     Love.     
     11.     Bahh4j     Delightful.
     12.     Jav~b     Answer.  
     13.     Ahad     Single.   
     14.     Vahh4b     Bountiful.
     15.     Vid~d     Affection.
     16.     Badi     Beginning.
     17.     Bali     Luminous. 
     18.     AbhA     Most Luminous.
     19.     V4hid     Unity.   

  Each cycle of nineteen years is called V~bid. 

 Nine teen cycles constitute a period called Kull-i-Shay'. 

 The numerical value ot the word ttV~hid" is nine teen, that of crKu11~ i-5hay' " is 361. t~Vihid" signifies unity, and is symbolic of the unity of God. 

 The BTh has, moreover, stated that this system of His is dependent upon the acceptance  and good-pleasure of "H. Whom God shall make manifest." One word from Him would suffice either to establish it for all time, or to annul it forever. 

 For instance, the date of the 21st of April, 1930, which is the first day of Ridvan, and which according to the Kitab-i-Aqdas must coincide with the ccthirteenth day of the see —  ond Baha'i month," and which fell this year (1930) on Monday, would, according to the system of the Badi' Calendar, be described as follows: ~cThe day of Kam~t1, the day of Qudrat, of the month of Jalil, of the year Baha'i, of the fifth VThid, of the first KulI-i-$hay'."

                    BAHA'I YOUTH

                   B~ MARZIEH GAIL

  SOME of the Baha'i youth were scattered around the world during these years. They had strange experiences in faraway places. 

 There was Duncan McAlear, Sergeant with the U. S. Medical Corps, walking down the road to Neufch%teau near Bastogne. It was just before the Battle of the Bulge. They had given him the afternoon off, and he had two plans, one to teach the Faith to someone — anyone who came along; the other to visit the only ice cream parlor in Neuf-ch&teau  and eat ersatz ice cream with ersatz cookies. He sat in the ice cream parlor and he saw an old man and woman coming. They approached a GI, asked something, got a curt "No," went on to another GI, asked again. Finally they came to Duncan. 

 They looked hopeful. But they spoke Flemish and Duncan's 

French was Massachusetts.  

 He listened, though, and they said, ttWe are seeking to recover an opportunity that we let go by." He told them to sit with him and have ersatz ice cream and cookies. He said, ccWh t opportunity?" 

 They said, "Long ago in Brussels, a woman brought us a teaching.  It was the answer to all our desires. But we let it go by. Now we keep asking the American soldiers if they ever heard of Martha 

Root."                     

 Later they said, 'tln those days we were afraid; afraid of being excommunicated, losing everything. Now we have lost everything  anyhow: the spiritual and the material. We want to learn about Martha Root's Faith and then we can die." 

 That was how Duncan went home with them, talking till midnight, overstaying his leave and being punished for it. But he was able to tell them what they wanted. 

 Young Rustam Paymin, born in Yazd, Persia, came to New York City from Tilirin. Shortly thereafter, when he had just reached twenty-one, he was elected a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly. Chairman also of the New York youth group, Rustam is a link uniting the youth of the United States, India (where he has many friends), and Persia. In Persia, he reports, the National Youth Committee is a very important body; as many as 210 youths have served at one time on this Committee and its thirteen subcommittees. 

 In the Baha'i year 101, local youth committees opened libraries for the sale and rental of books in ten cities and towns. 

 The first national Baha Youth Conference met in Tihr~n and among other things made plans to facilitate the education of Baha'i youth in outlying districts. 

 Some of the youth correspond with youth in other countries; others arrange teaching meetings, or musical programs, others organize classes in Arabic or English, or for literacy, others put out bulletins, or collect clothing and funds for the needy. An annual youth symposium is held here as elsewhere. Its theme is always designed, Rustam says, to make life in Persia healthier and happier." In 1944 the theme was, "How can you contribute  to the people's health and hygiene?" Youth were asked to contribute money, medicines, soap, medical teaching hours, hail space for lectures on hygiene, funds or labor to build a public bath, etc. The TibrAn Haziratu'1-Quds is equipped with playing 434

  fields and tennis courts; fifty-one Armenian youth rent the grounds and equipment on certain days. 

 Some of the Baha'is are outstanding  athletes. 

 The youth of Tilirin have a novel teaching  method. 

 They form groups of five, and each group makes friends with one or two nonBahA'is. 

 Refraining at first from religious  discussion, they eventually tell the newcomers of the Faith. 

 There are about sixty such groups in Tihr~n. 

 The example of the American believers is a great stimulus to the Persians. 

 The youth have gone out and pioneered under terrible hardships, both because of primitive living conditions and primitive behavior in backward areas. Two of the martyrs in the first year of the second century were pioneer youth. 

   Eta Mae Lawrence of New    

 York City went out as a Baha'i pioneer to Buenos Aires, Argentina. On arrival, she knew no Spanish; she had no job, and almost no money. She wanted to take the next boat home. 

 In great discouragement, she went to the tomb of Mrs. May Maxwell. "It is back in a little, deep, silent graveyard," Etta Mae says. ccTrees intertwine above the grave. When you go in, the bell on the cemetery gate rings and a little girl comes out and asks if you want to buy flowers. 

 You try to choose the ones May would have liked — small, dainty flowers. Her grave is like the Temple at Wilmette — it differs so from its surroundings." 

 She wept and prayed there at the tomb. Afterward, her problems were solved. 

 She obtained a secretarial job at the American Embassy, learned Spanish, and, although youngest of the nine, was elected chairman of ti~e Local Spiritual Assembly. The biggest problem confronting the friends there, she says, was the long wartime working hours, from eight in the morning till eight at night. There was little time to study and living costs were such that it was difficult to purchase books. The young Assembly, four of whom were in their early twenties, was weighted down with administrative tasks. 

 In July, 1944, the youth group were directed to prepare a monthly newsletter; this was brought out in the form of a £ our-page  mimeographed bulletin, containing messages  from the Guardian and excerpts from English Baha'i texts not yet available in Spanish. 

 The youth also furnished Baha speakers for an organization known as "El Grupo de Labor" open to all faiths, On Baha Youth Day, March 4, 1945, 

Etta Mae

  addressed the Symposium, which was followed  by a tea. Sr. Oscar Aguirre's subject on this occasion, ttGod's Plan for the Peace of the World," was a typical theme; Haig and Antranik Kevorkian were the other speakers. A reporter from the Standard Newspaper of Buenos Aires interviewed the youth and a very favorable article resulted. Before she left, the friends discussed the possibility of founding a summer school; at Eta Mae's suggestion, they cabled the Guardian, and received an answering cable warmly encouraging the project. Three of the Baha'is have beautiful adjoining gardens, totalling several hundred acres, on the outskirts  of the town; the school has now been founded here, and meets Sundays all through the summer. Eisa Mae hopes to arrange for American prefabricated houses to be shipped to Buenos Aires and marketed there; this would greatly benefit the Baha'is. 

 The youth of Argentina really study and know the Teachings, she says. 

 An eighteen-year old Argentinian, whose chief source of education  has been the Baha'i writings, can speak brilliantly on the Faith. 

 Santiago, Chile, celebrated Baha'i Youth Day at the home of one of the youth. 

Marcia Steward and Roberto 
Hererra spoke. Questions  
and answers followed.      

 Many nationalities  were represented, and the guests included  a famous Chilean actress, journalists and other professional men, all young and of great capacity, requesting further information  and Baha'i books. The youth of Punta Arenas celebrated the day with a public meeting at the Hotel 

Cosmos.                    

 In Lirna, Peru, the youth committee chairman  Alejandro Franco spoke at the Baha'i Youth Day celebration on "Youth's R6le in the World of Tomorrow." 

 A young woman, the most recent Baha'i there, spoke on woman's future rOle. 

Jorge Sarco, visiting Baha'i

 from Guayaquil Ecuador, presented the Baha'i Teachings. 

 A number of youth in Lima had expressed the desire to learn English; Alejandro Franco invited them to the Baha'i Center for this purpose. A club ultimately named "The Universal Fellowship Club" and complete with officers, regulations and emblem, was formed by them. They meet at the Center four times a month for educational games and discussion in English. 

 Their main theme for 1945 was "The kind of world in which I'd like to live." 

 Topics discussed from the Baha'i standpoint included Superstition, Prejudices, Crime and the Treatment of Criminals. Most of these youth attend the Cultural Institute and share the Baha'i principles learned with their fellow students. 

     Guayaquil's first Ba1A'i   

 Youth Day (1945) was held in the guest house of Mrs. Anita McGill. Nine nationalities were represented. 

 Eduardo Gonzales, member of the first Spiritual Assembly in Guayaquil, spoke on "Facing our Responsibilities," 

Lauro Sanchez on "Why      

 I am a Baha'i," and Virginia Orbison, visiting teacher, concluded.  Most of the members of the present community in Guayaquil are in their twenties. 

   Evelyn Larson, Chicago     

 youth, went as a pioneer to San Jose, Costa Rica. 

Luisa Baker, young Baha'i  

 pioneer to Caracas, Venezuela, attended in Panama the first Baha'i Latin American 

Conference.                

 Baha'i Youth Day, 1945, was held by the Baha'is of Havana, Cuba in the auditorium  of "Radio Universal," and broadcast over CMBF. Twenty-one year old Cantos de la Torre was chairman. Carmelo Perez, chairman of the youth committee, spoke on the history of the Faith, and Dr. Walker Blomquist on Baha'i principles and the r6le of Babi'i youth. 

 The program was advertised by a press notice in the Havana Post and by handpainted placards displayed throughout the city. 

 Because youth are specifically called upon by Shoghi 

Effendi in 'tThe Advent    

 of Divine  Justice" to participate effectively CC% both the teaching and administrative spheres of 

Baha'i activity," Ayned    

 and Lucien Mc-Comb  of New York longed to respond at once. Their plans were ultimately limited by the peacetime draft — Lucien could not leave the United States. They therefore chose Puerto Rico for their pioneering labors, gave up their jobs, sold their furniture and joined the two resident pioneers, Miss Jones and Mrs. Disdier. 

 Lucien obtained a good position in Puerto Rico and for four years their home was the Baha'i center. 

The first Local Spiritual  

 Assembly was established in San Juan, and today four other towns on the

  Island also have resident Baha'is. The young Sr. Marcelino Castro, first Puerto Rican believer, is now chairman of the all-Puerto Rican Assembly of San Juan, and has carried  the Teachings to his relatives in Juncos. Sr. Castro first came to the McCombs to study English; they taught him by having him compare the Spanish and English editions  of Esslemont, and he soon declared his faith. Jeffrey, the McComb's little son, was the first child born of Baha'i pioneers in the West Indies, and grew up speaking Spanish. The McCombs, well liked because they made every effort to respect local customs, reached hundreds of persons through conversations, literature, public meetings including Baha'i Youth Day, and the radio. Most of those attracted were young. They write: ""We, the Baha'i youth of the world, have the great privilege today of being able to take a large part in the promulgation of the Faith we are the ones who can best attract other youth." 

 North American youth, those who remained  at home, were hard at work, in their summer schools, particularly Louhelen; at youth conferences; on group and individual teaching circuits; on the air. They also taught the Faith in colleges; in this field Persian youth, such as Drs. Hiashang, Manfichihr J&vid and Earhang J&vid at the University of Illinois, 

FiriXz KAzim-Z~idih of Moscow

 at Stanford University, 'Izzat Amin-Amin  at the University of Washington, Shi-d&n  Fath-A'zam now at the College of Agriculture, Davis, California, and, arriving in February 1946, Jainshid Fozdar of India at the University of California, were also active. Youth in the Armed Forces such as John Eichenauer and Bruce Davison, and, including the women's branches of the service,  brought the Teachings to thousands. The story of these years is not yet told. 

     Seymour Weinberg, Warrant 

 Officer, j.g., became a Baha'i in Augusta, Georgia, early in 1944. 

 Articles by him concerning the Faith appeared in the Augusta Herald, on which he served briefly as a columnist. With the chaplain's permission, he placed Baha'i literature in the chapel at Daniel Field, Georgia. A new Commanding Officer forbade him to teach the Faith, but modified the order when Seymour pointed out that it constituted a restriction of his personal


<p438>
438             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  liberty; he was therefore allowed to teach with caution, and to give literature only to those requesting it. Hundreds of persons requested it. Not yet a Baha'i, he asked the Unitarian minister at Charleston, S. C., to have the Baha'i teacher Mrs. ALa Kruger address an evening forum there. 

 "Oh those people in the clouds!" was the minister's comment, but he extended the invitation and about one hundred persons came. 

 Seymour was furious with himself during the brisk question  and answer period that followed; he already believed in the Faith but had no arguments to support his views; following this he bought several armloads of Baha'i books and began to study in earnest. 

 William Towart was a conscientious objector.  Beatrice Rainboth visited his camp at Elkton, Oregon, holding crowded Baha'i firesides for three days. Towart and another C. 0., Michael Jaymir, became 

Baha'is.                   

 William, now realizing the basic philosophy  of pacifism was anarchistic, requested noncombatant service. Previously 1 — A, he was classified by the examining psychiatrist as 4F (rejected), because he had remained two and onehalf years in Conscientious Objectors' camps. He offered to pioneer for the Faith, and the 

National Teaching Committee 

 suggested Providence, Rhode Island. Here, in April, 1944, still in his twenties, he became chairman of the Local 

Spiritual Assembly. William

 was trained as a Congregationalist minister; before the war he was in charge of three churches in Ashland, Maine. 

 Baha'i youth of Winnipeg often invite speakers, such as Professor Craig of United College, to address their meetings at the Baha Center. Emeric Sala and others have addressed Dr. Craig's classes in comparative religion, and Mr. Sala also spoke to the institution's  Economics Club on "Baha'i Views on the Economic Question." 

 Marion Met-calfe,  student at the college, became a Baha'i. Winnipeg youth work with other youth organizations throughout the city. Three members attended meetings of the 

Canadian Youth Commission  

 (Manitoba Branch) and contributed to the Commission's study of "Youth and Religion." 

The Local Spiritual Assembly

 appointed Mrs. Jean Johnston as a delegate to the continuing Winnipeg subcommittee of this organization; in connection  with a popular ethnic concert held in the City Auditorium under their auspices, Mrs. Johnston made many friends for the Faith. United College also invited Rowland Estall to address its Student Christian Association, and Emeric Sala to speak before the interRacial Fellowship of the University of 

Manitoba. Baha'i Youth     
Day is regularly celebrated.
     Sixteen year old Brenda.   

 Coulson, daughter of Baha'i parents and living in Manchester, England, started a youth group there early in 1944. Nine youth, including children, attend the monthly gatherings, which feature a business meeting, a talk and refreshments. 

 Brenda also writes a monthly letter to young people in England and abroad; twenty-four of these are sent out, and received  as far away as the United States, Alexandria and Suez. 

 Brenda addressed a meeting at the Manchester  Baha'i 

Center on ttA Young Baha'i Looks

 at Czechoslovakia." Her talk was translated into Czech and printed in the Czech national newspaper. In token of their appreciation 

Karel Capek's book "Masaryk Tells

 His Story" was sent her by the Czech Foreign Office. 

 Torquay reports its celebration of Baha'i Youth Day. It sponsors social gatherings for youth and their parents, as well as study classes. 

 The present Baha'i youth of Germany were very young when, two years prior to the outbreak of war, all Baha'i teaching was forbidden in their country. Hedwig Hessel-mejer  of the Stuttgart youth group reports that a good many local Baha'is had their books seized by the Gestapo; her own home was not searched and the family were able to keep their Baha'i library. 

 Meetings were banned, but people read the Teachings in their houses. If anyone knocked, they hid the books. 

 Hedwig often discussed religion with such of her friends as she could trust, but many were atheists or rigidly sectarian. Stuttgart was heavily bombed from the air. After a bombing, the Baha'is would read the Teachings and thus gain courage to help the others. 

 Hedwig is glad that the Baha'is of Germany can now meet in freedom.

  Youth of Lima, Peru, and members of the Universal Friendship Club, whose weekly meetings are held in Miss Nicklin's home, the Baha'i pioneer for Peru. 

  In Alexandria, Egypt, girls now participate in Baha Youth Day celebrations, which are held at the Haziratu'1-Quds. 

 The youth meet Sundays to study the Faith tinder two teachers appointed by the Local Spiritual 

Assembly. Committees       

 run by the youth are: Literary Committee  —  to translate Baha'i newsletters into and from foreign languages, and prepare discussion subjects for the meetings; Service Coin-mittee  — to serve refreshments at Feasts, etc.; Correspondence Committee  —  to contact other 

Baha'i youth; Travel       

 Committee — to arrange weekend trips to outlying districts. The youth do much of the Assembly's office work; they are in charge of the Library and the Archives, and serve in the Accounting Department of both the Local and 

National Assemblies. For   

 the first time in Egypt, they published a wall calendar (year 102), selling it widely. The Guardian wrote them his appreciation of the five copies presented to him. 
   Authorities refused the    

National Youth             
Committee of Australia     

 and New Zealand permission to publish 

The Baha'i Youth           

 Journal either by printing or duplication. 

 Material for art impressive first issue had been completed, but the entire project had to be suspended. The Werriwa Baha Youth Group, i.e., the youth of Ycrrinbool and Tahmoor, hold meetings regularly. During the 

8th annual Baha'i Summer   

 School at Yerrinbool, (which meets in January), the youth arranged a threeday program. The cctennis afternoons" could well be copied elsewhere: youth from Yerrinbool, Wok longong, Bowral and Wingello come to these, for tennis and other games as well as discussions  on the Faith in the Hyde-Dunn Memorial 

Hall. Baha'i Youth Day      

 was celebrated  with a tennis tournament at CtBoltdn Place" and a talk followed by discussion. One of the youth, Shirley Smith, declared her wish to become a Baha'i. A message from the American, Henry Jarvis, for the youth of today, was featured. 

 Sydney circularized  thirty youth organizations, inviting representatives to the Youth Day celebrations (1945); talks were given by the Principal,  Sydney 

Conservarorium of Music    

 High School, on "Edf and Youth"; by a representative of the Women's League of Health (a physical culture display item by youth followed this); a member of the Aborigines 'Welfare Board and the secretary

  of the National Spiritual Assembly also participated; young artists supplied the music. About seventy persons attended, and following  dinner were shown through the beautiful 

National Headquarters     

 of the Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand. The program, continuing on the next day, featured four talks by youth on themes suggested by the youth of North America. Hobart observed Baha'i Youth Day as a public meeting at the Lord Mayor's Courtroom. 

 The Junior Red Cross, the Quakers, the League of Nations and two Baha'i speakers shared the program, which was followed by a dinner at the Baha'i 

Center. The Auckland      
youth have been studying  

Esperanto. On Baha'i Youth

 Day, Adelaide youth sent out letters and airgraphs to individuals in the service and to the National Youth Committees of the British Isles and of Persia. Two gifts of £5 each, by Mrs. W. H. Hawthorne and Jim Heggie, went toward founding a youth lending library which was already in use by Youth Day. Other youth organizations, Uni —  versity students, High School teachers, business  girls, the press, musicians, were present. Lucy Trueman was chairman, and the musical program included the radio artist James Duncan. A buffet supper and social gathering followed. 

 In India the youth are organized wherever  a 

Local Spiritual Assembly  

 exists. Teaching is their main concern; they are considered the most effective teachers of other youth. They correspond with youth in other countries, and attend classes for deepening in the Faith. Under India's Six Year Plan which established so many new groups and assemblies, the following youth pioneered: Muhammad IrshAd of Calcutta, to 

Serampur; 'Azizu'114h     

 NawA-Yazd~n of Bombay, to Sholapur; Kaykhusraw Manavi of Bombay, to Sholapur; 

'Azizu'114h Tashak-kuri   

 of Bombay, to Sholapur; Khudidid Suhayli of Bombay, to Koihapur; Mrs. Khud6xl6xl Suhayli of Poona, to 

Koihapur; Gushtasp Yiginigi
of Poona, to Belgaum; Mrs.

Yig6nigi to Belgaum;      
Mrs. Ridvan Mubidz~idih   

 of Poona, to Surat; Baha J. Z. Mahalliti of Poona, to Mysore; Baha Ayd6n of Persia, to Quetta; 

Miiru'llAh Akhtar-Khivari 

 of Persia, to Quetta; 'Au Sulhjii of Persia, to Quetta; MihrbAn Akh tan of Karachi, to Lahore. 

(And later) Muhammad Hayit

 from Delhi, to Jarnmu; 'Abdu'r — Rahmin from Delhi, to Nagpur, where Mr. and Mrs. MihrUn Bomas are also teaching. 

 A youth, Jamshid Th6bit, served six months as assistant to the secretary of the National 

Spiritual Assembly, 19444

 5. Youth symposiums were held February 26, 1945, in Calcutta, Bombay, Poona, Pancligani, Koihapur, Sholapur, Karachi, Srinagar and Ujjain. Many of these meetings were reported in the press, and a wide circle of non-Bahi'is thus learned of the raith. 

 On this day the youth of the cities named wrote jointly to the Guardian. Excerpts from his reply follow: "It pleased him greatly to see that there are so many active Baha'i youth groups in India, and his heart was particularly rejoiced to receive messages from such far-off centers as Kashmir and BalAchist4n, where, a few years ago, there were practically  no Baha'is at all! He hopes that in the years that lie ahead of us — years of unrest, of trouble; of transition for the whole world — that the Baha'i youth will increasingly rise to meet the challenge of the times, and to carry the message of Baha'u'llah, through both teaching and example, all over India, and, indeed, Asia He hopes you will study the teachings deeply, their spiritual moral, and administrative precepts, and at the same time take as active a part as possible in the life of your respective Baha'i communities. 

 At Pancligani, a bill station 63 miles from 

Poona, the National Spiritual

 Assembly  established a youth hostel where children of Baha'i parents could live together and profit from their earliest years by Baha'i precept and practice. At present the children  will attend school elsewhere, but it is hoped that the hostel will eventually develop into a Baha'i school. Founded August 1, 1945, its inauguration was attended by the National 

Spiritual Assembly. The   

 program that day makes a not inappropriate conciu-sion to this short survey of Baha'i youth around the world; we quote: were chanted and talks on the Baha'i principles given. The command to parents to educate their children, giving

  preference in this matter to daughters; the obligation of the state to undertake this work where the parents failed, recovering the cost from them where they were financially able; the necessity of learning some art, craft or trade; the discarding of that learning which begins in words and ends in words, were stressed. 

 There were seventeen students at the start; it was a small begin — ning truly, but does not the mighty tree spring from the tiny seed? Telegrams of congratulations and donations from the friends were a proof of the support of the Indian Baha'i community to this institution and the following cable from the Guardian an assurance of its final success: tDelighted praying steady progress newly founded institution  loving appreciation.' 
                           
         YOUTH'S ROLE IN FUTURE CIVILIZATION

                     A SYMPOSIUM

                       PART I

             "Dynamic Power of Religion"
                  — Takashi R. Imagire

  A GENERATION ago it might have seemed that science could manage the world and guide it into permanent prosperity, happiness, and a secure civilization. 

 But such does not seem to be the case now. Science has proved itself to be a marvelous instrument for material progress; but it is certain that no ideal civilization based upon justice and mutuality can be established by means of science alone. 

 "Science is one of the wings with which humanity must fly; but religion is the other," said 'Abdu'l-Baha, the son of the Founder of the Baha'i Faith. Religion is a necessary force, for religion is dynamic in the influence it exerts on both the hearts and minds of men. 

   In "Security for a Failing 

 World," by Stanwood Cobb, a noted educator and writer, a Baha'i, the first chapter is entitled, ~~Js the 

Intelligence of Man Capable
of Creating a Stable Civilization?"

 The intellect  of man can plan and create, but it is not, in the vast majority of men, a force capable of Governing the emotions. On the contrary, the intellect with most of us serves chiefly as a tool or instrument with which to gain the things we want. Thus the intellect tends to become the servant of man s emotional nature rather than its ruler. Of course, there are some men who by the force of their intellects can completely govern their emotional natures, but they are so rare that they are called philosophers. 

 When man's social standing or economic security is involved, man's action tends to be founded upon his most basic emotions of egoism and greed. Take for example the fallacy of saying education alone will soive race and class prejudice, the abolishment of which is one of the basic principles for world peace. 

 The drawback is the fact that when pressure of public opinion comes to bear, or when having racial or class prejudices becomes too comfortable to obliterate,  man acts according to the way he feels rather than the way he knows intellectually to be right. In such cases education merely makes him more clever and subtle in rationalizing  his prejudice. If education alone fails, what then? 
What can govern the emotions?

 It is religion. Has not religion proved its ability to do this in the past? 

 Indeed it has; and it will prove its ability to do this again in the future. Recall in history, how often in the name of religion, for its cause, men have been able to overcome their emotions of fear of death, to withstand persecutions, to sacrifice their all for religion — how it has changed their lives into pious ones, enabling man to acquire a zealous desire to serve. Christ called it "btl" In considering the effect of religion upon men it is necessary to differentiate between nature religions and revealed religions. 

 Na-mire  religions, religions which have evolved through man's own naive concepts concern

  ing the cosmic forces that surround and condition him, rise no higher than their source. Revealed religions, religions that are revealed  by the Manifestations of God, the Mouthpieces or Messengers of God, have a very striking effect upon the lives of their adherents. 

 Who were those who proclaimed to express  the Will of God? We who are of Christian background will know Christ did, and Moses. 

 With deeper study into history, we find that Zoroaster did, so did Krishna, Buddha, Muhammad, the Mb, and Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith. But you may ask, were they all really 

Messengers  of God? Investigate

 and find out! Christ said, "By their fruits ye shall know them." Each One just mentioned lived in utmost poverty, were humble men and yet have been able to change the lives, the hearts of men, even many hundred years after Their passings. All based Their Teachings on the Love of the One God. Each established  great civilizations and have been able to do so without military power, political influence, or monetary backing; no one but a Manifestation of God has been able to do this! 

 Each Manifestation of God gave spiritual laws and social laws. The spiritual laws are the same for all time; they have never changed. All religions teach that we must do good, that we must be generous, sincere, truthful, law-abiding, and faithful. All this is reasonable and logically the only way in which humanity can progress. 

 The social laws are given to the utmost capacity of the people of the time in which these laws are presented; the capacity of thd people determines  the necessary laws to be given by the Manifestation, just as the condition of the patient determines the necessary remedy to be prescribed by the doctor. 

 In the time of Moses, there were ten crimes punishable by death. 

 When Christ came this was changed; the old axiom of an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" was converted into t(love your enemies, do good to them that hate you." In the former days the punishment for theft was cutting off the hands, which was necessary for that time. In our time, this law cannot be applied. 

 One will also discover that revealed religions reach their zeniths and then decline and come to an end, due primarily to the fact that manmade rituals and misinterpretations creep in. But by God's infinite mercy, religion is renewed by another 

Manifestation.            

 It is easier to perceive the dechne in other religions than to become aware that the period of decline has been reached in one's own religion. Whether we like to acknowledge it or not, the fact is that Christianity,  compared with its dynamic power in past centuries, manifests an evident decline  of spiritual force. In the Western world science ousted religion as the directive force of society, and religious skepticism has grown with great rapidity. 

 A century ago in this country, God was recognized as the guiding power in all human affairs. The Name of God was on the tips of the tongues of the founders of our country. 

 We moderns are very conscious of the comforts and pleasures which science has brought us, but we are too little conscious of God as the one power which animates and dominates all things. 

 Christ said, ttBy this shall all men know that ye are My disciples: if ye have love one to another." However, Christianity today has not only become split into division after division, into an increasing number of sects, which are bitterly opposed to each other, but also strife exists between Christians, Moslems, Jews, and Buddhists. "By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples A great stumbling block to many, in the way of religious unity, is the difference between  the revelations given by the different Manifestations. 

 What is commanded by one is forbidden by another; how then can both be right, how can both be proclaiming the Will of God? Surely the Truth is one and cannot change. Yes, absolute Truth is one and cannot change; but the absolute Truth is infinitely beyond the present range of human understanding. Our conceptions of Truth must constantly change, whether from a religious or scientific standpoint. Each Manifestation proclaimed a former teacher and promised the return of another. Our earlier, imperfect ideas will, by the Grace of God, be replaced as time goes on

  by more and more adequate conceptions through these 

Manifestations. Just       

 as a man's concept of a dog changes during his lifetime. To a baby, a dog was something that was soft and furry and that liked to lick him. 

 To a boy, a dog was a faithful companion which wagged its tail when happy and liked to chase cats. 

 To a young man, a dog was an animal with four legs, usually of the wolf family or in the case of the Chow from the bear. 

 To a scientist, a dog is of the phylum, Chordata; subphy-lum,  Vertebrata; and of the class, Mammalia. Of the Mammalia, a dog is of the Eutheria, under that of the Monodephia, because it is nourished before birth by a placenta unlike the Marsupials who carry their young in a pouch; and so on. Describing a dog as a carnivorous domesticated mammal, the sci —  entist would go on to say that his bone structure is such and such, and that his circulatory, digestive, respiratory, reproductive,  and nervous systems are thus and so. In such a way does the scientist change his boyish, imperfect ideas, for more adequate  conceptions. 
 And so it is with religion.

 The religion of God is one religion, and all the Manifestations have taught it; but religion, like science, is a living and growing thing, not lifeless and unchanging. 

 For example, in the teachings of Moses we see the bud; in those of Christ, the flower; in those of Baha'u'llah, the fruit. The flower does not destroy the bud; nor does the fruit destroy the flower. It destroys not, but fulfills.  The budscales must fall in order that the flower may bloom; and the petals must fall that the fruit may grow and ripen. It would be foolishly sentimental to say, ttOh, but the flower was so beautiful," and then refuse the fruit when the bearing of the fruit is the very purpose of the flower. It would be foolishly sentimental to say, ttOh but I admire my high school teacher," then refuse to graduate and go on to college when the very purpose of the high school teacher was to prepare the student for college. It would be foolishly sentimental to say, "Oh, but I love Christ" and then refuse to accept the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, when the very purpose of Christ was to prepare His followers for Him, as Christ promised. 

 Science alone fails to give us a secure civilization; the intellect of man fails, owing  to the fact that the emotions rule the intellect. Religion is necessary to control the emotions, so that the emotions can properly use the intellect as a tool to reap the benefits of science in order to establish world peace. 

 Religion is renewed and revealed periodically, especially at the most trying and darkest hours, and has been able to raise mankind to a high level of civilization because  of its dynamic power to influence both heart and mind, because true religion appeals both to heart and mind. 

 All great civilizations were founded, directly or indirectly,  by the revealers of religion, the Manifestations of 

God.                       

 Of all times, we are in dire need of a Divine Physician. We now live in a dark hour. But some of us are beginning to see the Light, to see that the dawn is breaking. 

PART II                    

  t'The Time Foreordained" 

                   — Betty Scheffler

  THERE is no revealed religion whose Founder has not reserved a part of His Book for prophecies concerning One Whom God would manifest subsequent to Him. All religious  scriptures contain prophecies regarding the time of the end, known as the Day of Judgment or the Day of Resurrection, when the Promised One would appear and bring the Kingdom of God upon earth. 

 Moreover, all peoples are awaiting two Manifestations Who must be contemporaneous. In the Bible, the Jews have a promise of the Lord of Hosts and the Messiah. 

 In the Gospels, the return of Christ and Elijah is promised. In IslAm, the Mihdi and the Messiah; and it is also true of the other religions. 

 The Baha'i Message is that this great day, awaited by all, has indeed come; and


<p445>
BAnAl YOUTH ACTIVITIES              445

  that through the advent of the Bab, and Baha'u'llah, the promise of all the ages has been fulfilled, and the age which is the consummation of all past Revelation ushered in.     The prophetic cycle has ended, and the cycle of fulfillment begun. 

 In the year 1844 in Shiriz, Persia, One who is known as the Bib, which means Gate, announced  to eighteen men who had been awaiting and searching for the 

Promised One, that He      

 was a mouthpiece of God and that he had been entrusted with the Divine Mission of warning the people of the approach of the time of the end, the coming of that great hour which would witness the descent of the Spirit of God spoken of in the Holy Scriptures. 

 In His books He extolled the name, mentioned the signs, pointed to His Revelation, alluded in symbolic language to the exact time of 

His appearance. These      

 eighteen men, the first disciples of the Bab, He sent to all parts of Persia to announce tp the people His own Revelation as a Prophet of God and to prepare them for the advent of the One Who was to follow, Whom the Bab referred to as "Him 

Whom God Shall Make Manifest." 

 So fearlessly and eloquently did these followers proclaim the Message, that the news of the appearance of the Bib rapidly spread to all parts of the land. 

 Persia was at that time perhaps the dark. est country, her people the most degenerate, ignorant, and superstitious, in the civilized world; and they were held in submission by the fanatic and corrupt Moslem clergy, who exercised undisputed authority over the masses. In word they professed belief in God and in His Prophet, Muhammad; in deed they denied His Teaching and had come to be opposed to every new and liberal idea, devoted oniy to maintaining their own position of leadership. As the BThi Faith grew and the commotion stirred up in Shir4z began to spread to other cities and provinces, the clergy saw in it a threat to their authority; and so they arose to put out the light of the new Faith. For a time they refrained from open hostility, realizing  that this would defeat their purpose, and sought to win the support of governmental  authorities by circulating false rumors  accusing the 1Mb of political claims. 

 The conversion of an even greater number of men of eminent rank, recognized for their learning and wisdom, who openly acknowledged their belief in the truth of the B&b's claims, served to bring the Cause to the attention of the multitudes. 

 Soon a wave of inquiry swept over the whole country and large congregations gathered to hear the Message of the Prophet of Sbir~z. 

 Finally the situation reached such proportions that the ShAh himself was no longer able to ignore  it; and so he delegated one of the most trusted and influential of his subjects to investigate the matter. This man, Vahid by name, in the course of three interviews, was so completely won over by the arguments  and personality of the BTh, that he returned merely a written report to the Court and arose to dedicate his life to the service of the Faith, for which he later became a martyr. 

 The clergy, determined to halt the progress of the B~bi Cause, enlisted the support of the grand vizar of the Sli~h, and in turn, of the local governments, by implanting in them a fear of their ultimate downfall, should the Cause of the Bab succeed in awakening the people to demand the needed reforms in the church and state. They were successful in precipitating a series of tragedies which followed one upon the other and to all outward seeming extinguished the light of the Faith. 

 The B~b was imprisoned in a remote northern province in a mountain fortress and except for a brief moment when He was called to Tabriz to appear before a group of ecclesiastical and state dignitaries who hoped to force Him to abandon His claim or, by ridicule, cause the people to abandon their belief, He spent the remaining years of His life in prison. From here He wrote warnings and appeals in anticipation of the approaching hour of his martyrdom and of the appearance of the One Who was to follow, whose advent the Bab characterized as ttlhe Fruit and ultimate purpose of His Own Dispensation." 

 Meanwhile in three different sections of Persia, wars raged against the Bab's. 

 Civil and ecclesiastical forces joined and undertook the systematic plunder and massacre of the Bab community. 
The imprisonment of the


<p446>
446            THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Bib had become a signal for the commencement of a reign of terror which swept over the whole country. So brutal was that reign of terror in which over 20,000 followers of the Bib were put to death under the most cruel and revolting tortures, that a noted French publicist wrote, (cAll Europe was stirred to pity and indignation." 

 In 1850 the BTh, then in His 31st year, fell a victim to the fanatical fury of persecutors and was martyred by a firing squad in Tabriz. 

 For the moment the flame which had burned so fiercely and intently for nine years seemed extinguished, but it was destined  to blaze forth once again through the Revelation of the One foretold by the Bab. 

 Baha'u'llah, whose name means the Glory of God, was born in 1817 in TihrAn, a member  of one of the most prominent families of Persia. He turned aside from material comfort and security and embraced the Cause of the Mb, becoming one of its most fearless exponents. He succeeded in enlisting  many of the learned doctors and divines  of His native province in the service of the new Faith. He became recognized for His wisdom and eloquence in answering the questions and arguments of all who caine to Him. 

 During one of the uprisings against the B&bis, Baha'u'llah was arrested and forced to suffer four months in the prison dungeon of Tihnin. Upon His release it was decided that He should be exiled to Baghdad, 'Iraq. 

 Here Baha'u'llah brought the Bab community into unity, strengthened and guided it, instilling new faith and courage in the hearts of its members. It was here in the year 1863 that Baha'u'llah announced that I — Ic was the One foretold by the Bab, Whose advent all of the peoples of the earth were expecting. 

 He announced that He was the inaugurator of the long awaited Millennium, the One promised by all the Prophets of the past, Whose dispensations were a preparation for His Own. Those who arose to proclaim the truth of the Cause of Baha'u'llah became thenceforth known as Baha'is. 

 Baha'u'llah, forced to leave His native land in 1853, spent almost his entire life a prisoner and an exile, suffering banishment from Baghd~id to Constantinople, then to Adrianople, and finally to imprisonment in 'Akka, Palestine. Each succeeding banishment ment and imprisonment saw not the diminishing in the number of His followers and the dissolution of His Cause, but rather their increase and an ever greater unity. In 

Adri-anople,  Baha'u'llah  

 proclaimed His Mission to the world's secular and ecclesiastical leaders — the 

Christian and Moslem      

 clergy and the kings, who because of the authority and ascendency they had assumed, were responsible  for the inunediate destinies of their followers and subjects. As Baha'u'llah addressed these epistles, calling them to embrace  His Truth, His followers were already spreading His Message beyond the confines of Persia — to Egypt, to the Caucasus, and to 

Syria.                    

 Baha'u'llah's banishment to 'Akka, lasting  twenty-four years, to which the ShAh of Persia and the Su1~n of Turkey condemned  Him, is a period which saw~ changes in many ways in the life and activities of Baha'u'llah — cbiefly in the tremendous extension of the range and volume of His Writings. These constitute the sequel to the proclamation of His Mission initiated in Adrianople, the Revelation of the Laws and Ordinances of His Dispensation, and the reaffirmation and elucidation of the fundamental  Laws and 

Principles of His Eaith. Baha'u'llah

 Himself affirmed that never since the beginning of the world has the Message of God been so openly proclaimed. 

 In the year 1892 Baha'u'llah passed from this world, and with His ascension a period unparalleled in the world's religious history drew to a close. 

 Prophecies foretelling the advent of the Faith had been fulfilled, the fundamental laws and principles  — the foundation for the world order destined to arise — had been enunciated; and finally, Baha'u'llah had provided for the preservation  of the unity and integrity of His 

Faith.                    

 Through the Covenant established by Baha'u'llah in which His son, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was appointed the sole interpreter of the Baha'i Teachings, the Faith was protected from the disasters resulting from division which has afflicted the religions of the past. After the passing of Baha'u'llah, His followers  turned to 'Abdu'l-Baha for the explanation  and the decisions regarding the understanding and application of the laws


<p447>
BAHA'I YOUTH ACTIVITIES             447

  and principles of the Faith. Under the ministry of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Faith was spread throughout many countries. Baha communities  were established in the western world, in France, in Germany, in England, and in the United States, as well as in the East. After 'Abdu'l-Baha release from prison which He shared for forty years with His Father, Baha'u'llah, He undertook a three-year journey to the West, to Europe, and America, speaking before large audiences  in churches, synagogues, and before peace societies upon the basic and distinguishing  features of His Father's Faith. 

 And in the city of 'Ishqabad, Russia, the first Baha'i House of Worship, initiated by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, was completed. In Wilmette, Illinois, plans for the construction of the first Baha'i Temple of the West were made and the cornerstone laid by 'Abdu'1-. Bali. 

 Through Him every barrier that threatened to halt the progress and development of the Faith was cut down, the Teachings  were amplified, and the features of the Ba1i~'i Administrative Order — which Baha'is believe is the pattern for future world order — were delineated. 

 Upon the death of 'Abdu'l-Baha in the year of 1921, His grandson, Shoghi Effendi, was appointed through his Will and Testament,  the first Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, and in him the authority as interpreter of the Teachings rests. Under the guidance and direction of Shoghi Effendi, the Faith has expanded and developed; today Baha'is are residing in seventy-eight countries of the world and Baha'i literature has been translated and published in forty-one languages. And so already, only one hundred years after its birth, the BaU'i Faith can be seen to be the world Faith, uniting the peoples of every race and nationality. 
                          
                      PART III

            "God's Plan for World Peace"

 — Charles Monroe loas know the conditions extant in the world at the period of the inception of the Baha'i Faith. That the condition of the world has been altered more during this first century of the Baha'i era than during any corresponding period in the history of mankind cannot be disputed. 

 Baha'u'llah brought principles and plans which in His age would be termed revolutionary. 

 This issue of world peace is one. One hundred years ago — or even fifty years ago, for that matter — real world peace and unity was an unheard-of thing. 

 Today our greatest desire is the planning and organization of a strong and durable peace. This is the thought foremost in the minds of all men, as whichever  way we turn, we are confronted with peace plans — plans which are based upon economic interdependence — plans which are based upon political cooperation  —  plans which are based upon geographical proximity. 

 When we think of the manifold peace proposals today, we come to the conclusion that surely one of these will meet our needs. 
But is this the case?     

 In order to answer this question we must have some definite objective  towards which we are striving. Our first desire is that this should be a lasting peace; we also wish that all men be included in this peace; and finally, we are desirous of its being a cooperative peace. Will the plans which are being put forth throughout the world today assure these results? 

 The peace plans of the economists will not. One chief reason is that the peace of the economist consists solely of a group of agreements among the various governments. They cannot stand alone without the backing  of the individual citizen; and the citizen will not stand behind pieces of paper bearing  astronomical figures which he does not comprehend and which do not directly affect him. 

 Nor will a geographical peace achieve these results. 

 When one speaks of a geographical  peace, it necessarily entails exclusive characteristics. In other words, there might be peace, for example, among the Americas, while the countries of the Orient


<p448>
448     THE BAHA'I WORLD

  remained in a state of disunion. This condition might be likened to a sick body — if one part of the body is ill, the remainder of the body is affected. Therefore, the final peace must include all nations and peoples of the world. 

 Likewise, a political peace is inadequate. Agreements made by governments ignore the fact that men will retain their inbred feelings of hatred, animosity, and prejudice. With these conditions existing, men will never be able to live together amicably. 

 Now, why is it that none of these plans could achieve the desired results? 

 There is one chief reason, and that is the fact that they all overlook the most important element of any durable peace — the individual. The true peace must be one in which all men will be able to live together in a friendly and loving world. In order to achieve this, the minds and hearts of men must be altered — men must learn that they are all the leaves of one tree and the fruits of one garden — that they are, in reality, equal to one another. Manmade plans are incapable of doing this! 

 ttGod alone ordereth all things and is all powerful." 

 Therefore, a divine plan is in order — a plan which bears the power of God to alter man's inner being. 

 It is this plan which Baha'u'llah has brought to the world in its darkest days. Baha'u'llah has brought God's plan for world peace! 

 The foremast criterion of a true and lasting peace is the unity of mankind. This unity does not mean a signing of pacts by the nations of the world; but it means a bond of unity which ties all men one to another. 

 Americans, for example, must realize that the people on the other side of the globe are their neighbors, not foreigners; that they are the same type of men as are the Americans. 

 Biologically and spiritually, men are all the same, wherever they may happen to be born. It is merely a figment of man's imagination which creates the differences which cause our present lack of unity. Religion is one unifying force, for


<p449>
BAHA'I YOUTH ACTIVITIES             449

  Baha'i Youth Group of Poona, India, 1946. 

  it alone is the cause of love and affection. Therefore, religion is the only road to the unity of mankind. 

 How, then is this most great unity to be achieved? 

 In the first place, according to the teachings of Baha'u'llah, prejudices of all sorts must be obliterated and forgotten. This is imperative in order that men may face each other with clear minds and untainted  consciences. 

 In reality, however, this elimination of prejudice is not so great a task, for when we analyze prejudice, when we tear it down to its roots, we find that there is really no cause whatsoever for prejudice. 

 Religious prejudice, which is so rampant in the world today, was never meant to be so by the One Object of the adoration of all the religions. Nay, one of the teachings of Jesus Christ was that one should "be in 'ave and charity with all men." What a far cry from this are the conditions which exist today, for now there is animosity and division even among the followers of Christ. However, when men realize the unity of God, religious prejudice will pass out of existence. 

 In the same way, racial prejudice is an illusory thing. It is superstition, pure and simple. 

 What folly it is that we should think that the color of a man's skin could affect his inner being! What greater folly it is that we should think that one particular  color of skin should naturally entail a greater intellect and a finer moral character. 

 As previously mentioned, all men are one and the same in the eyes of God. 

 Again, we see that national prejudice is false. But I need not go into this — we know that God created no territorial boundaries! Thus it is that prejudice, one of the chief causes of animosity and warfare among men, is a mere nothing which will disappear as a puff of smoke into the sky when analyzed. Its absolute banishment is one of the steppingstones to world peace. 

 Another steppingstone is that there must be equal educational opportunities throughout  the world and that there must be a universal language established. 

 The necessity of these things is selfevident. 

 One of the hindrances to unity in the world, today is the fact that we cannot understand the other people of the world. Education and a common language will eliminate this barrier.


<p450>
450             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The third steppingstone is an economic one. Baha'u'llah tells us that there must be an equal access of the means of existence for all. There must be no extremes of wealth and no extremes of poverty. 

 There must be a cooperation between labor and capital. However, it is not a socialistic state which we foresee, for the Baha'is recognize that humanity, like a great army, requires generals,  captains, various other officers., each with his own appointed duties. 

 Degrees are absolutely necessary to insure an orderly organization. 

 These are but three of the larger and firmer steppingstones to the true peace which lies at the end of this trail. 

 Let us now see what form God's ordered world is going to take. In the first place, it will include all the peoples of the world, none will be excibded. 

 All the nations of the world will surrender supreme sovereignty  to the central international government.  However, each member state will, at the same time, remain autonomous. This type of organization can best be visualized by comparing it with our governmental form, in the United States. 

 Here each state is sovereign in all matters which pertain only to the citizens within its borders. However, our federal government makes the decisions when two or more states are concerned. 

Recreate  the United States

 on a grander scale, and you have a World Federation with a strong world government. 

 To this world government, the states will cede their privilege of making war. 

 Also, the member states will disarm. This govern-inent will naturally need funds with which to function. 

 Therefore, it will have a taxing power. Moreover, economic barriers will be removed in order that there may be free and unhampered trade among the nations. 

 At the head of the world government wiii be an 

International Executive   

 with powers adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every member of the world organization. 

 His duty will be to carry out decisions of the legislature and to act quickly in times of emergency. 

 The legislative branch of the government will be composed of a World Parliament whose members shall be elected by the citizens  of their respective states and whose nominations shall be confirmed by the government  of their countries. In this way, we will have a truly representative governing body. 

 Finally, and of greatest importance, there will be a Supreme Tribunal established by the peoples and governments of every nation,  composed of members elected from each country. 

 The members of this great council, who have been elected by the peo-pie  and approved by the government of their countries, will assemble in unity and accord. All disputes of an international character will be submitted to this Court, its work being to arrange by arbitration everything which otherwise would be a cause of war. A majority vote of this body will carry a measure; and, since it is a truly representative  body, its decisions will be binding upon all parties concerned. However, if one of the nations does nor wish to obey, there will be an international police force to enforce the decisions of the International Tribunal. In this way, we shall have a strong world government continually conscious of the best interests of all the peoples of the world. 

 Thus it is that world peace will come to pass! 

 Thus it is that men some day will live together in concord and in harmony! 

 Thus it is that the world will eventually be organized as one corporeal body! 

 This is God's plan for world peace!

         "The Spiritual Challenge to Youth"

                   — Pan Zia-Wairath

  TODAY youth has become heir to a world which is economically, socially, politically,  and religiously in a state of complete collapse. How can youth hope to rebuild  this broken down civilization? 

 Will it be worth restoring; and furthermore, will this restoration last and not fall into ruins again in a few decades? 

 Innately youth is full of enthusiasm, courage, love of adventure, anxious to conquer new frontiers, ready for every challenge. 

 The establishment of a World Order based on the Laws of God, as given to man by the Prophet for this day, Baha'u'llah, — this is the greatest challenge ever presented to youth. 

 Youth needs a goal, an ideal upon which to set its aim. Paul Baker, a former religious director at Fiske University, in his article on "The Mind of Youth," says that some great challenges are needed to offer the young people. A great crusade with high motives behind it lifts youth to its greatest heights. 

 Young people are capable of great hardships, suffering, sacrifice, and service. —  there is in youth potentialities of greatness and nobleness, which are drawn out only by a great task. 

 Man, through God's mercy, is the only creature on earth which is the possessor of freewill, that is, he can turn toward God through 

God's divine Messengers   

 or he can reject God and His Prophets. This is all a part of the Spiritual Challenge. Youth must in this day investigate Truth for himself.  And during this investigation, what will he find? That every person, every group, the scientist, the economist, the politician,  has a different idea, a different standard  for Truth. How can he be certain then what the standard should be? 

 Every criterion  for truth which man possesses is subject to error and fault. Baha'u'llah tells us that the oniy standard of truth which is infallible is the standard given to man by God through his Holy Manifestations, or Prophets. This is the standard that we must use today, the standard for re-educa tion, for economics, the standard upon which the laws for human relations, the laws governing  national and international problems must be based. 

 We hear a great deal today about unity; but I wonder how many people realize just what that very small word implies? 'Abdu'l-Baha has drawn a very clear and beautiful picture of this unity which starts in the very depths of the earth with the minerals themselves being gradually assimilated by the vegetable kingdom; the vegetable, in turn, is raised to the station of the animal kingdom by its assimilation into that kingdom;  and the animal is, in turn, absorbed into the very tissues of the human; and how is man uplifted? What is the purpose of his creation? 

 The cycle must be rounded out and completed in some manner; there must be some great cause in the back of this ordered creation. 

 Man must in this day realize the aim and purpose of his entire existence — to know and to iove God and through his love for God, love his fellow men. 

 Before true universal Peace can be established there must be a complete unity of conscience. Not just a superficial unity which consists in saying or thinking "Oh, yes, we are agreed there must be an end to war." — ttWe are ready to love everyone." 

 are willing to observe the rights and privileges of all men." This unity must be realized in the very hearts and souis of men. 'Abdu'l-Baha tells us that this spiritual unity which emanates only from the Prophet of God is the perfect unity, that it creates such a condition in mankind that each one will make sacrifices for the other, that the utmost desire will be to forfeit life and all that pertains to it in the behalf of another's good. This unity has been demonstrated in the past. We are acquainted with the dynamic  power of the Prophets of the past; we know the great history of this World Faith, of the thousands of martyrdoms of people who were not spiritually blind, who as in the times of the previous Prophets,

BAHA'I YOUTH ACTIVITIES             453

  Baha'i Youth attending the Symposium held in Bombay, India, February 25th, 1945, in honor of International Baha'i Youth Day. 

  knew the oniy way to establish a Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. We also know the plan which Baha'u'llah gave to the world nearly a century ago. What kinds of persons were they who so willingly and gladly gave up their lives that a Great Truth might live? They were men of the same character as those who must put into practice this new plan of living, This plan can oniy become effective if carried out by a people who are living truly spiritual lives, by a people willing to forsake personal aims and to dedicate  themselves to universal goals and ideals, willing not only to dedicate their intelligence and strength, but also their lives. 

 For when the Prophet of God comes, He changes the very heart of man and this unity, this faith, and this obedience to the laws of God must be carried into every degree of existence, into the political sphere, the business world, the world of arts and sciences, For it is not enough to have a belief in religion, that belief must be transmuted over into everyday living. 

 Religion guides the individual in his relation to his fellowmen, The test of true religion lies in the influence it has on our lives, It must produce in our hearts a love of God which must be transmuted into iove for man; it must produce a sense of security and true happiness for man. 

 We cannot deny that religion as it is today  has failed to guide youth and to give it the security which is its crying need. Youth cannot be imprisoned by the narrow theological doctrines of manmade religion. Youth cannot accept a religion which is so different from the scientific and logical principles  which are the foundation of education today. 

 The revolt of modern youth seemingly  against religion is at bottom not revolt  against religion, but against the trappings and dogma that conceal the true God. The solution must be not in an unnatural limiting of life, but rather in the spontaneous  motivation which can oniy come from a religion which youth freely adopts and holds to with complete loyalty. 

 Yes, this civilization can be rebuilt — this old world order will be changed through the will of God. 

 Man will, by his own volition,  live on a higher spiritual plane and abide by the teachings of true religion. Then will the most Great Peace which Baha'u'llah prophesies descend on mankind. 

 'What greater challenge, what greater crusade could be given to youth? 

 Baha'i Youth has accepted this challenge, Into this great world wide movement the youth of many countries, of many races, of many hereditary religions are throwing themselves with deep sincerity and earnest endeavor. The Baha Youth have found in the teachings of Ba1A' —  u'llAh, the fulfillment of all the prophetic cycles of the past and the great spiritual truths restated in modern terms for this modern world, Through the teachings of

  Baha'u'llah, youth can assume the opportunities and responsibilities of this day, for Baha'u'llah has given the plans, the purpose, the standards, and ideals for the building of a new race of man and a new civilization. 

 lBahA'i Youth all over the world are able to look forward to the future of civilization with security in their hearts, with clear and untroubled minds, because they know that out of the ashes of this confused and chaotic  state will arise a new world through the power of the Spirit emanating from God and released to this modern world by Baha'u'llah. 
                           
                   FAITH IN ACTION

            B~ JOHN CARL EICHENAUER, III
"C'                        
     k) GOD! These souis are    

Thy heavenly Army. Assist  

 them and with the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse, make them victorious, so that each one of them may become  like unto a regiment and conquer these countries through the love of God and the illumination of the divine teachings." —  'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 These lines are from a prayer in the Tablets of the Divine Plan revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha  (The Servant of the Glory), for the carrying of the 

Message of Baha'u'llah       

 (The Glory of God) to all parts of the earth. 

 The first part of this Plan was completed with the establishment of the Baha Faith in every State and Province in North America, and in every 

Latin American Republic.   

 With the emergence of Europe, Asia and Africa from the perilous night of war, the stage is set for the fulfilling Tablets of the Plan calling for the anchoring of the 

Administrative  Order     

 in every country of these sorely-afflicted continents. 

 Let us review some of the initial steps made in this worldwide teaching campaign by Baha'is in the military services. 

 There were soldiers, sailors, merchant seamen, WAGS, 

WAVES and a Woman Marine   

 in the United States forces, not to mention service personnel of Canada, 

Australia, Great Britain   
and other countries.       

 Well over 200, they participated at once in the disintegration of the old order of nationalism and prejudice and in the inauguration of a new era of international cooperative undertakings.  Front line aidmen and rear echelon Joe; suppiy troops and intelligence person-ne',  white and Negro, young and old, officers and enlisted men, they reached every continent  and traversed every ocean in laying the foundations of the world civilization envisaged by the Divine Architect of this Era, Baha'u'llah of M~zindar~n. 

 First let us hear from the South Pacific. A Chicago 

Baha'i, Technical Sergeant 

 Edwin  H. Koyl (attached to a medical Unit) writes from New Guinea, "Lonely as life is here, I often think of the significance of all that is transpiring. 

 I say lonely because that is about the only effect this war has had on me in a negative way. Others have given their lives, some have given their limbs, their speech, their eyes. 

 Just as the Guardian said about a decade ago; ours is to be a spiritual martyrdom, and in place of physical blood oftimes I have bled spiritually.  It was a trying experience, I say, was, because I can look back on what seems to be the worst of it. (He wrote on 18 June 1945.) We always figure it that way until we find ourselves in another Cll~ But you and I know that there is always something to be gained from such experiences.  I have tried my best not to let the message of each incident and trial escape me; time will tell how well I have succeeded. 

 ttMy present position is a very pleasant one, has been for the past several months. We have a small but efficient setup that administers primary medication to a large group of service troops. Each day is filled with its responsibilities to be discharged, and each night finds us one day nearer the Lesser Peace and those we love. 

 ~     find plenty to keep me busy. It seems that there is always just a little more to do than I have time for. Is not that an ideal situation? Idle time is spent running movies for the officers three nights a week, playing volley ball, writing letters and read

  ing. As to the latter, through the generosity of Mrs. Julia Shows, I am now enjoying cGod Passes By.' Have received the Chicago Baha'i News regularly, the National not so often. I would like very much to be furnished  with a list of the Baha'i communities in the Philippine Islands. 

 CeIt can now be told that I am stationed at Mime Bay at the southeastern tip of New Guinea. It is a beautiful spot, truly one of the spots of the South Pacific. 

 Were there snow on the mountains opposite I would feel right at home. 

 Green jungle, blue sky, and bluer water, cocoanut palms — oh, how romantic! 

 Except for ten weeks in Biak (I) have been here over nineteen months. 

 t~Remember me to the Community, and tell them that if perchance I cannot make the Outer Drive in '45, surely I can make one-one-six

Your Baha'i brother, Edwin

 Koyl." (This letter was written to the editor of Chicago Baha'i News, Mr. I. W. 

Steven.)                  
    From the Western Pacific  

 on Saipan, another  Chicago Babi'i, Joseph F. Peter, writes in a letter to Mrs. loas, 

Chicago Baha'i Servicemen 

 Correspondent, "Do you know Patti Pettit? (From Bucyrus, Ohio.) Well, he is now on Tinian and I've already arranged for transportation there — even got Saturday off, too — I hope Joe (Joe Tierno of the New York Community) can make it with me —  he is trying. The way we are going now we're liable to form an Assembly — if we only had six more, and (if) I (were) a few months older!!! Clement Perry (of the Cleveland Baha'i Community) has so far supplied us with all the addresses, but he is still all alone (on New Guinea). 'Abdu'l-Baha said that all parts of the world must be visited including the islands of the Pacific and a good number have been visited already. "For a man can withstand anything except that which was divinely intended." 

(Quoted from Chicago Baha'i
News for August, 1945.)   

On September 28, Joseph   

 writes, "Tomorrow I'm heading for Tinian with a friend of mine in my outfit. When I first heard that Paul was on Tinian I asked my friend if he wanted to come along to Tinian to look over the island — he asked if I knew Paul — I said no, he asked if I had ever

  written him — I said no — did I know what he looked like — nope! ! — he was really floored, but when Paul walked out of the hut I knew him instantly and my friend remarked to me later, our greeting was like that of two lost brothers. By now my friend has almost finished Esslemont (Baha'u'llah and the New Era,' by Dr. J. E. Esslemont) and I'm looking forward to a very pleasant weekend on Tinian with Paul, 

Harry (a New Orleans Baha'i)

 and my friend. The most pleasant seven months of my life was spent in Honolulu where I had a chance to meet all the friends including some from Maui and Hawaii and especially Miss Agnes Alexander who shared many of her experiences  in Japan and other countries with me." 

    Still another Chicago     

 Baha'i, Lt. Ernest A. Thayer, D. C., U.S.N.R., writes, ~ left my home and last station on March 8. I reported for sea transportation on March 17 at San Francisco (and) waited until April 4 when I started ship hiking and island-hopping across the Pacific. The first stop was Pearl Harbor, next Eniwetok, then Guam and finally to my ship on May 14. 

 "It was all very interesting, sometimes rather rugged physically, but I came through in good health and good spirits. I must say though that I failed to find that wellknown so customarily associated with South Sea islands, so I can eliminate a few spots from my itinerary if I ever take a peace time world cruise. 

 ttMy ship is large and comfortable, if such can be said about life on a ship. It is really not bad at all but any residence in the tropics gets monotonous, especially because of its limitation. The temperature is well over 100 degrees right now, and I have found that, even though I have been here only a short time, the body adjusts itself quite well, because the other day in a mild typhoon the thermometer dropped to 82 and every one was quite chilly. 

 "This is a repair ship which does all kinds of repairs for other ships. 

 Due to the nature of work, the personnel is highly specialized, and in general the officers and men in charge are of good type intellectual ly.    This is good in some ways, but I seem to stand alone, mentally and spiritually, with respect to Baha'i. 

 These men are either sat. isfied with what they have or have a tendency to ignore spiritual values altogether, so my opportunity to pioneer among them is very limited." (From Chicago Baha'i News, 

September  1945.)        

 A member of the Cleveland Community, Pfc. Clement J. Perry (with a suppiy unit) writes on August 31, 1945 from Manila, c(Yesterday I was in my tent and in came Dick Sulim (of Sandusky, Ohio community). 

 We were glad to see each other and we talked a long time about the gang and old times. He is located roughly five miles away from me; it sure is shorter than the 1,000 miles that we were separated prior to my moving." 

    Corporal Joe Tierno, 176th

 Station Hospital,  of New York City writes on 18 August 1945 from 

Saipan, ttPaul Petit      

 is on a neighboring island (Tinian). Joe Peter went to visit him by boat, I followed by plane. Paul has paid us a return visit by boat.~~ From Luzon, P. I., Pfc. 

 Richard T. Sulim (with a medical unit) from Sandusky, Ohio writes on 5 July 1945, tcSo far I haven't run into any Baha'is in Manila, though there must be many. 

 However, the city is in such a state of ruin that life is far from normal. 

 •I was talking to one of the Hindu guards out here the other night who has lived in the Islands for nineteen years. He said that at the time he left India there were very many Baha in that country. I am still working in the dispensary and enjoying it all very much. We have a good gang to work for. Among other things I am writing a book with one of the bouts out here about life in the Army in the Philippines. Also, I have an opportunity to study calculus  at the Philippine Institute, two nights a week. Then, also, I am studying a correspondence  course in Elementary Analysis from the University of Wisconsin.~~ These informal accounts portray the daily life of and demonstrate the deep feeling of fellowship that exists among Baha'is, some of whom know each other oniy by correspondence. 

 Their common bond is belief in the Elixir of the Divine Physician of this age of maturity of the human race. Yesterday oceans separated them, today they are stationed near each other, but ever present is

  the spiritual tie of "one universal Cause, one common Faith." Regardless of race, color, social or economic background, tcA11h~~ AbLY' (God the Glorious) is the password to happiness for any Baha'i in over seventy countries of the world. One feels that the early Christians, Muhammadans and Jews must have had the same close brotherhood in their religious activities. 'Would that all religions might reexamine and emulate the lives of their first believers and martyrs. 

 Baha'is have the obligation to share their treasure with all interested in raising the moral, social and economic standards of the whole human race. 

 Opportunities are many: The first sergeant (a Catholic) would like to know just how this Faith is different from Christianity. 

 (Basic spiritual verities are the same in both — the belief in one God and the brotherhood of man — but different material  laws and institutions designed for the needs of a world civilization are needed today.)  A buddy wonders why you give up alcoholic beverages. (Either we abide by every Law of the Prophet or we compromise our loyalty. 

 Man cannot obey two masters.) Another fellow says, "All you do is eat, sleep and drink religion." Of course, we don't aim to be fanatics, but we do believe religion should be the guiding force in human  life, that our actions should be motivated  by a desire to serve humanity, that moderation should be practiced in all things. If religion does not influence our daily life, it is no more than a coat we wear on Sunday and take off the rest of the week. 

 And now a word from a veteran of North Africa and Italy. Pfc. Charles 

H. McAllister (of New     

 York City), Medical Detachment. He writes from Naples, "By my new address you can see I am not with the 386th Engineers  any more. 

 We were saddened and broken hearted when we were informed that we were to be separated and sent to two different  organizations. 

 Our Colonel did his best to keep us together but to no avail. We


<p458>
458             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  were as one family and practically everyone in the battalion had heard of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 They were particularly interested  in the principle of the oneness of mankind. 

 We discussed it not on one, but on many occasions. 

 I often read to them from 'The Advent of Divine 

Justice,' 'Baha'i World     
Faith,' 'The Promised      

 Day Is Come,' and also from tThe Dawn-Breakers.' 

 ~'Since I have been in Naples I have found a music teacher and I have been taking voice lessons for about six months. 

 Her name is Signora Asunta Cimmino Vingiani. Her husband speaks French; so I gave him a copy of tBahA~u~11Ah and the New Era' in French. After reading it through he said to me, tThis is the religion for the Italian people. Every Italian should have this book in his home.' I also gave away a copy of tThe Hidden Words' and The Seven Valleys' in French; so you can see that the teaching horizon is very bright. 

 Aside from my regular duties and music lessons, I find time to sing with the orchestra, and work with Special Service and the Red Cross in presenting programs for the GI's. 

 So, until next time, your Baha'i brother, Charles." 

     A Milwaukee Baha'i, Technical

 Sergeant R. C. Niss, writes, "In my work, survival and combat in Arctic and wet, cold condi-rions (Aleutian Islands), I have come across a few 

Alaskan Eskimos and Indians

 and rather than telling them specifically about the Faith, I drew out from them their ideas and feelings in order to better understand them. 

 In fact, this idea has guided most of my Army interests. From a virtual ignorance  of people, their ideas, habits and feelings,  I feel I have a small foothold now of understanding them. 

 Nothing of my Army career have I regretted for the association with such different personalities has gained me much. Yet with seventy-three points I should be on my way home after four and onehalf years and will that be a happy day!" (October 5, 1945.) 

 Quite a few Baha'is served in Germany. From Launsbach by Giessen and Frankfurt we have a fine account from 

Sergeant Robert  Bruce    
Davison (Medical Unit).    

 On 22 August 1945, he writes, ~ have seen my brother twice (they are both from Miami, Florida) over here and have given the 

Mes                        

 sage to most of the boys in my outfit and to at least a dozen civilians in every town we've been in, and in this town, many, many more than a dozen. Three people I've met have heard of it before. 

 Before our recent great change in personnel most of the boys knew that I was forever and without condition  plugging racial equality." Not having any addresses of Baha'is in Frankfurt, Sgt. Davison inserted the following notice in the Frankfurter 

Rundschau of September     

 8, 1945, "Baha'is in Frankfurt wollen sich bitten in Verbind setzen mit Sgt. 

 R. B. Davison, 156 Infant Medical Detachment Heddernheim, 

Romerstadt Strasse."       

 In a few days he was visited by several Baha'is. The first meeting in seven years was held Friday, 14 September 1945 at the home of Herr Barthel, 14 Wohlerstrasse, and by the end of the month the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Frankfurt was in the process of formation due to his exceptional zeal, On October 7, he wrote, ~I was shipped to Europe in December of 1944 with the 70th Infantry Division. 

 Our unit had just eighty-eight days of combat, one of which my brother spent with me. It was the 17th of 

February near Forbach.     

 We talked Baha'i a few minutes, read a prayer together and then worked the whole day, bandaging and evacuating the freshly wounded till we dripped with sweat. (Sgt. Davison was a front-line aidman.) 

 (Since the first meeting) we have met weekly in the following order: Herr Barthel's, Friday, 21 September; Niedernan 58, 28 September; and now our regular• place of meeting, 

Gutleut Strasse 121, Friday

 5th October. I spoke on September  14, twelve present; Fri. Edith Horn and I spoke 21st, 16 present; Dr. Hermann Grossman spoke on the 28th and 5th of October with 22 and 18 present respectively."  Bruce's weapons are a winning smile, a marvelous personality and-an  extraordinary grasp of German acquired in only a few months. 

   Lix Richard A. McGurdy     

 (of the Lima, Ohio, community, with a medical unit), served in western Germany and writes on January 26, 1945, "As you probably have already surmised, I am in a forward medical station, having mostly liaison duties. At the dispensary (in Paris) we had some real dis

  cussions, there being a Jew, a Buddhist and several Christians among the medics. Earlier I had met a Muhammadan soldier in one of the depots. 

 So we could surely talk unity and peace from several angles. You can well imagine. 

At Mereville, one English-speaking French

 woman is writing to Barbie (his wife) about it. In Paris, the dispensary clerk (an instructor in French at home) and I met some friends near the Bastik and in the course of the evening I showed pictures of the Temple, among which was a photograph of 'Abdu'l-Baha which they questioned  me about. 

 Much to my amazement the clerk explained the Cause, mostly in French, and later these people passed the Message on (I only caught the word Baha occasionally) to a cafe owner who remarked that Paris needed such a Faith. 

 This French woman who also spoke fairly good English, asked me several times ~f I would come and tell her more Baha'i and introduce her to other Baha'is in Paris. tYou will take me, yes?' was her last request. But my orders ended my Paris trips." 

 Later, he writes from Recklinghausen, Germany, ttIweekend before last I spent a few days with Cap't. (Connie) Baker (also of Lima), my first Baha contact since I left Barbie last August in Greenville, Pa. We did have a splendid time — he is with the 25th General Hospital in Belgium — not far from Maastricht or 

Liege."                   
  Technician Fifth Grade    

 David Ned Black-(of  Binghamton, N. Y.), attached to a Field Hospital, writes on October 6, "I have yet to meet any Baha'is overseas, although  it has been possible to tell many people of the Faith and, on occasion, to follow up their inevitable interest. In England, or among Army personnel, these contacts  are not unusual. They occur more frequently than they did at home; due, perhaps,  to our encountering more people; due, more likely to the awareness of world needs which the war has forced. 

 "It struck me as unique, however, that my first contact on the Continent should be a Belgian woman who spoke no English. Our convoy had stopped before her home for a noon break and she brought us fresh bread and coffee. Contrary to some experiences  we had had with civilians, she determinedly  refused payment of any kind.


<p460>
460             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  This was intriguing. With much pantomime,  and my limited French, she told me of her three sons, dead in Germany, and of her unwavering faith that a better world was at hand. At that point we should have moved on, but I was impelled to try to tell this lady about the Ba1A'i Faith. 

 As our convoy started to move, one of the lead trucks discovered a need for repairs. They took over an hour, during which I tried to convey Baha'u'llah's Message, with some success. 

 She wanted to know more than there was time to tell, so I left her a copy, in English, of tBahi'i 

Teachings for a World      

 Faith.' She assured me that she had a friend who could translate it to her. As we drove away she stood turning the pamphlet  in her hands and smoothing it, waving now and again until we were out of sight. 

 "There was the German who worked for us who wanted to talk politics. 

 When I told him that tEin Reich, em yolk, em flihrer' should be superseded by tDie Erde is nur em Lande, und die Gemainschaft ist das yolk,' he responded enthusiastically, saying that friends should be chosen by the responding of heart to heart regardless of birth, color, or politics. 

 He, too, was enthusiastic over the Baha'i principles. 

 tcThere have been all kinds of encounters with people who, while not yet Baha'is still show great awareness of the spirit of this age. They always seem glad to hear of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah and, regardless of speech barriers, it always seems possible to give the Message wherever it is necessary. 

 I know something of what the man must have felt who, although he knew no Persian, protested the tinterruptions' of the interpreter who was translating as 'Abdu'l-Baha spoke. That man's sympathetic comprehension was founded on a spiritual understanding which required oniy the Master. Words were superfluous. 

 ttj believe the Teachings hold something of that same power, even in our hands. It has often happened that as soon as my halting translation into French or German has established one of the principles of Baha'u'llah  as the basis for conversation, a bond of understanding comes into being which bridges the difficulties my ignorance of these languages has caused. Comprehension flows faster than words can follow. It is much like rolling a hoop which requires oniy an occasional tap in the right direction to keep it bowling along! 

 "Of all my experiences in Europe, this impresses me as being most significant. Wherever, whenever, it has seemed right to tell a fellow man of the Baha'i Faith, those differences of birth, race, nationality, education, religion, language, and all of the other accidental variations of circumstance which are commonly thought to obstruct understanding, have vanished. We are two men talking together of the values in life which shall always matter; rejoicing that, in our time, these truths have been brought to maturity, and struck with new power, through their enunciation by a Manifestation of God. 

 "The language of the heart transcends speech and, through the increased understanding  which study of the Faith brings, a Baha'i is well schooled in this tongue. It does not require words. There was a Mongolian  who came to us, shot through the chest from side to side. He was uneasy among strange people and strange experiences, but our eyes met in friendship and we understood each other. And he quieted enough so that we could help him. 

 ccThere was a Nazi, dying, who needed a hand to hold. 

 What are the politics of Death? The look he gave me before he closed his eyes could have been read in any country. 

 ceStatistically I have distributed over a hundred pamphlets tBaM'i Teachings for a World Faith,' discdminately, always to someone who either read English himself, or who knew a friend who would translate for him. 

 Of the leaflet, tThe World Faith of Baha'u'llah,' Shoghi Effendi's summary, I have given sixty or seventy away. And it has ken possible to speak of the Faith to perhaps fifty or sixty others to whom it was not practicable to give literature. Allah'-u'AbM!

            YOUTH AND THE BAHA'I CAUSE
             B~ ESTEBAN CANALES LEYTON

  Foreword:     Before expressing my modest opinions upon this subject, I desire to make it clear that in speaking of the youth, I do not only refer to people of 21 years of age, or less, but to those up to approximately 30 years of age. Also, I wish to state that the Baha'i community of Punta Arenas, of which I have the privilege to belong, is composed in the majority of people of this age. 

  J FIRMLY believe that the greatest responsibility for the most successful progress of our beloved Cause in the near future rests upon the young people of this great World Community, and upon the labor they exert will depend especially the swift establishment of the Faith. It has been my observation, during my short experience as a Baha'i teacher, that when young people enter the Cause, they embrace it with more sincerity, more loyalty and enthusiasm, than the older peopie, and thereby achieve more efficient work in the spread of the Teachings. 

 It is very natural and logical that this should be so, not only here in my country of Chile, but in any land, inasmuch as the youth are less attached to prejudices and traditions of the past. Once they enter the Faith and come to understand its true im —  portance, they devote their best energies toward the attainment of such high purposes as the unfolding, by every means within  their reach, of the sacred Teachings of our Well-Beloved Baha'u'llah, the oniy remedy which can save this so very sick body of mankind. 

 Many of the friends who read these humble statements will know already of the growing victories which are being won by our beloved Faith in this isolated tip of the Continent. 

 This is due to the great efforts put forth by the young members of this Community under the wise guidance of our experienced and excellent teachers, Mrs. Marcia 

Steward and Mr. Artemus   

 Lamb, with whom I have had the privilege of coi-laborating. 

 It is for this reason that I make a fervent call to all the dear friends who have the privilege of imparting the sacred Teachings of our beloved Baha'u'llah, to devote and concentrate their greatest efforts in attracting and preparing the young people in our Cause, for upon them depends the greatest and swiftest success of the establishment of the Baha'i Faith. 

  YOUTH ACTIVITIES IN MAGALLANES, 

CHILE                     

  In Punta Arenas, the most southerly city of the world, a public meeting for the Youth was held for the first time, on July 29, 1945. Participants on this occasion were the youth members of this community, several  members of the Assembly and various young peopk interested in the 

Cause.                    

 The meeting was held at the residence of Mr. Artemus Lamb and was arranged by Sr. Esteban Canales Leyton, Srta. Rosy Vo-danovic and Sr. Hugo Arteagabeitia, members  of the Assembly, who read interesting extracts from the Baha'i Writings, selected for this occasion. 

 Srta. Nelly Andrade gave a beautiful program of piano compositions, after which tea was served. 

 It was an interesting and friendly gathering which was distinguished by the cordial and happy spirit which reigned throughout the event. 

 In the same city, on the 4th of August, another meeting was held for the Youth and other people interested in the Cause, consisting of a tea which was given at the Hotel Cosmos. After tea was served, Mr. Lamb showed the slides of the Temple which had recently been received from the United States. Sr. Esteban Ganales gave explanations of the views which were projected.

 Sessions afford valuable opportunities to observe in detail the methods of Baha'i teachers of children, who, gathered together from several States and Provinces, are working together in true Baha'i harmony. 

 At the Geyserville School session of 1945 the children shared in the practical application of Baha'i community life, as the pupils in the older classes provided,  through their handicraft proiects, some of the equipment needed for the classes for the younger children. 

 The ages of the children ranged from the nursery group, who were from two to five years old, through the primary grade aged from six to eight, the intermediate from nine to eleven, the high intermediate from eleven to thirteen, and the junior youth from thirteen to fifteen. 

 The teachers were well qualified for their work, having had experience in their own communities, and they were not restricted as to their methods of teaching. 

 One very important feature was the general  assembly for the children, before they went to their separate classes. This was conducted by the supervisor of the children's  study classes. Volunteers were called upon to recite prayers, and it was an inspiration  to see the junior youth respond

  readily and unhesitatingly. 

 They will so soon be shouldering their share of the Baha'i work for this second century. 

 Volunteers were also asked to lead in singing, and even the little nursery tots would step up in front of the class and lead with one of the simple Baha'i songs which the children had selected. A few words of inspiration about the Baha'i Teachings or perhaps a short quiz would follow. 

 One morning the children were asked what they thought the title "Hidden Words" meant, and a seven-year-old promptly answered, "I think it means hidden  truth." 

 The songs and prayer and the kindly, cheerful little chat with the children seemed to set the tone for the day's work. This work was divided into two morning class periods, from 9:30 to 12:15, including the assembly; the first period for study and the second period for handicraft. Some of the classes were held outdoors on or near a large porch. 

 The nursery tots had an enclosed outdoor play yard, with swings and a sand box. 

 The classes for the nursery tots are very important. 

 There are families who come to Summer School every year and their children start in the nursery and come on up through the classes. The nursery work requires  two teachers in attendance at all times. 

 The special project for the nursery children was to teach them cooperative play. During the first period they played in the sand box and the swing, sang nursery songs, played with toys and were entertained by the teacher reading stories. Simple handicraft was given them during the second period. 

 Expression painting was perhaps the most interesting of the handicrafts. For this the washable water paints were used. These come in powder form and are mixed with water as required. 

 Most paint stores carry this paint under brand names. Some schools get kalsomine  paints, which are mixed with water, instead of the special water paints prepared for children. 

 Poster paint, which is mixed with water, may also be used. If the children spill this paint on their clothing, it can be washed out if laundered within twelve hours. 

 For paper we used what the newspapers call newsprint. 

 Some newspapers have butt ends of rolls that they will sell and others have scrap which' they will gladly donate for children's classes. 

 'Wallpaper is also a splendid material, as the back is plain and the texture is good. Discontinued lines may be purchased cheaply, or ends of rolls left over from papering rooms may be used. The pieces should be about 18 by 24 inches. 

 In our classes these sheets were thumbtacked to easels which had been made by the junior youth class as a handicraft proiect. 

 Each child was allowed to select his own color and those of four and five years of age were allowed to have two colors. Small brushes with long handles were given them. No suggestion was made as to what they should paint nor were they asked what they were painting until they finished. Some finished in five minutes and wanted to do something else, others worked at it for some time. When the picture was completed, the children were encouraged to tell what it was and then their name and the name of the picture was written in the corner. 

 No attempt  whatever was made to help them with the painting or to correct anything they painted. 

 There is a paint also which can be given to the children for finger painting. For this form they simply apply the paint with a finger instead of using a brush. 

 These expression paintings are of great value to experts trained in diagnosing mental and nervous conditions of children. Sometimes children are cured of nightmares and nervous upsets by thus expressing themselves freely. They seem to transfer the strange confusions in their young minds to the paper and are relieved of nervous tension. 

 Clay modeling was much enjoyed by the children. 

 We made this clay by mixing 2 cups of salt with 1 cup of flour and adding water to make a stiff dough. 

 A little of the powder used for making the water paints gave it the necessary color interest. The vegetable colorings sold in the markets for coloring cake frostings and candies can be used, and are harmless if the children try to eat any of the clay. If this clay is worked back into a ball and wrapped in a wet cloth it can be used repeatedly. Commercial clay

  from the toy stores was used also at Geyser-yule. 
.

 Bright colored paper which can be purchased d at the stationery store has many uses in handicraft projects. If it is cut into small patterns, designs, such as triangles, , crescents, squares, circles, etc., the children paste them onto a gray background, arranging the different shapes to make a picture. 

 . Strips of the colored paper can be pasted to make paper chains to use for decorating the hail when they exhibit their work; or they can be woven into mats, allowing g the children free expression in color combinations. 

 Whenever the children tired of what they were doing, they were allowed to do something g else. Sometimes they liked to stop their work and look at bright pictures in a story book. Five minutes is a long time for the youngest ones when there are so many attractions such as the swing and the sand box and the toys. It was found most helpful to give the children a simple lunch, such as graham crackers and milk or fruit juice when the change was made between the class periods. This not only applied to the nursery tots but the older ones were found to benefit by it also. 

 The special theme of study for the chii-dren n past the nursery age was to learn a little more about the spiritual stations of the Mb, Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha and Sho — ghi Effendi.. In one class this was carried out by teaching and reviewing for several days, and then having the children question each other. For instance, one child would be given the topic of the Bab and the other children told to prepare questions to ask him the following day. 'Abdu'l-Baha said that children should question each other in class. Some very unique questions were asked. The children's questions approached the sublect from angles that had not occurred d to the instructor. One child asked if the Bil were still living when 'Abdu'l-Baha 5 was first sent to prison. They also wanted definite historical data about the difficulties the believers had in moving the body of the Bab from the time of His martyrdom until 'Abdu'l-Baha placed it in the shrine. They seemed to respond to stirring g events, action and evident facts. 

 In another class the children were told to give the Message of the Faith to a visitor who came in. This they readily did, and one boy brought out a copy of ttBahA~u)11Ah and the New Era" and showed her the chapters containing the answers to her questions. She asked what kind of a religion it was and who it was for, and one small boy told her


<p469>

  Baha'i Youth at Esslingen School, Germany, August, 1945. 

  it was a "public religion," and that it was for everybody. 

 An interesting study of the ttHidden Words" was made in one class. Each child would be given a description of a Hidden Word and asked to find it and read it in class next day. As an example, one of the verses of the C(Hidd Words" tells where God has stored His jewels. 

 The children enjoyed this and thought it a great joke on themselves that they had to read the book of ttHidden 'Words" several times in order to find these particular verses. Each one was asked to find his own verse without help from the other members of the class. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha said that it was well for children to receive prizes for their work in school. 

 In one class in preparation for this, points were given each day for work assigned  the day before. 

 At the end of Summer School two of the children in the class tied for first place. The two stood up in front of the class and had an exciting quiz contest to decide which one should receive the prize. This had been decided on at the beginning of the class when the children asked what would happen in case two of them had the same number of points. Children  not only work much harder when a prize is to be given but ate much easier to discipline; for instance, points c~n be taken away for unruly behavior. 

 The handicraft classes for the otder children produced some very useful and ornamental  articles. 

 The macaroni plaques were particularly interesting. 

 For these, macaroni in the form of letters of the alphabet was used. 

 All stores do not have it, but stores selling fancy groceries, especially Italian stores will have it. A pound is sufficient for a dozen or more children. 

 The children sorted these macaroni letters out to make verses of the ttHidden Words." Plaques about 6 by 8 inches were cut of plyboard, and painted with shellac. If the plyboard cannot be obtained, then wall board made of processed paper can be used; plaster board should not be used unless the edge is bound with tape. 

 This wall board must then be painted with shellac or sizing. The macaroni letters are then fastened on with mucilage.  The mucilage should be used freely. Any stain it makes on the board will be covered with paint later. Flower or scroll decorations can be added by using letters such as ttu" and ttv" for the petals and tr for the stems; or some of the letters can be broken to make interesting outlines and patterns. 

 These arc allowed to dry until the next day, then enamel paints are used


<p470>

  in several colors for the background, the letters and the decorations. 
These are very attractive. 

 Plaster plaques and book ends in interesting  shapes and designs were purchased and the children painted them with oil paints. 

 These plaques were first lacquered with shellac. 

 Then a large plate was placed in the center of the table and various colors and shades of oil paint that comes in tubes was squeezed out on this plate. Brushes were dipped in turpentine while using these paints. When the paint hardened on the plate over night, the brushes dipped in turpentine would soften it. Small brushes were used for both the plaster and macaroni plaques. The work on these plaques was carefully supervised by a competent instructor and the children were taught to clean their brushes. 

 They turned out very creditable work. 

 The boys in the junior youth class were instructed in the making of work tables for the different classes. They also made the easels for the nursery class and enameled tm cans in bright colors for holding the water paints the children used. 

 One of the projects for girls in junior youth class was the making of bean bags and stuffed toys for the nursery class. 

 For the fairy play given this year, the girls made butterfly wings of yellow crepe paper and pasted bright spots of color on them. Head bands with antennae were made of cardboard. The making of the costumes was volunteer work which they did during their free time in the afternoon. 

 The meaning of prayer was the study theme for another class. The story of los the Shepherd Boy, with its great wealth of spiritual symbolism, was used to illustrate the need of our being alone once a day to remember that God gives us everything we have, and that we should iove God more than worldly wealth. The story is in several  parts scattered through different study outlines, and Baha'i books and magazines. The instructor told it to the children in simple words. Then the children made a cardboard panorama illustrating the scene of the king leaving his castle for a horse-b  ck ride and finding the simple shepherd boy where he had waited by th~ road for hours in order that he might look on the face of the king he loved so well. 

 For this panorama, a long work table, about 30 by 64 inches, was covered with two large sheets of cardboard. Plain white paper such as newsprint or wrapping paper would do if cardboard is not available. 

 The children  sketched in the road and the grass with crayons. The castle was made of cardboard. A square box and some long narrow boxes for towers was very effective. Corrugated paper such as bottles are wrapped in made good roofs. For the sheepfold and the shepherd's  hut the children wanted to use some long narrow sticks which they had found. These they glued together and glued to the table and it was very realistic. The horse, the men, the sheep and the trees were cut from cardboard ahd thumbtacked to the table. 

 If no one in the class sketches, the necessary pictures can be obtained from the children's  picture books or by watching for pictures  in the advertisements in magazines and newspapers. 

 If heavy cardboard is difficult to obtain, the sides of cereal boxes may be used by gluing two printed sides together to make one good firm piece of cardboard. The pictures may be traced from the magazine  with thin paper and transferred to the cardboard with carbon paper, cut out and colored on both sides with crayon. 

 These figures will stand erect if they are bent at the bottom. For instance, split the trunk of the tree lengthwise for about one-fourth of an inch then crease one side of the trunk forward and the other side backward, two thumbtacks will then hold it to the table so it will stand erect. 

 A paste made of flour and water or a wallpaper paste, which is obtained dry and mixed as needed, would do just as well as glue or thumbtacks. 

 It is a good object lesson for the children if they learn to substitute simple homemade materials for those which are sometimes difficult  to obtain in stores for one reason or another. 

 The lake with the swans was part of the panorama and the children made the lake of white paper colored blue with crayon and tacked the cardboard swans securely to it. T his panorama could have been made by using a mirror for the lake, small pieces of

  foliage for trees and modeling animals and men out of the homemade clay we used for the nursery handicraft. The children planned the placing of the objects in the panorama and learned a lesson in Baha'i consultation at the same time. No one child decided the placing of any of the figures, and, in case they were not unanimous in their decision, a vote was taken and the minority readily accepted the decision of the majority. 

 Something of proportion and perspective can be taught them when they are selecting the pictures, so that they will not have the sheep as large as the lake and so that they will understand why the objects  in the foreground can properly be large in proportion to those in the background in order to convey the sense of distance. 

 An entertainment put on by the children forms part of the Summer School program, and the children who made the panorama also worked out a play based on the story of los the Shepherd Boy as their contribu —  lion. Another class put on a one-part play of a little girl who falls asleep and learns of the Baha'i principles through the fairies, and wakes to find that her mother has been n~ading "Baha'u'llah and the New Er.~." 

 This was very attractive, as it gave the Baha'i 

Message.                   

 The easels were brought on the stage for the nursery children the night of the entertainment  and they sang nursery songs and painted a picture. 

 Each child then explained to the audience what his picture represented. 

 The older girls had learned a new song for the occasion and there were prayers in English, Spanish and Arabic. The nursery paintings were displayed on the walls and the handicraft was spread out on tables. The children decorated the hail with crepe paper streamers. This was volunteer work on the part of the children, which they did in the afternoon after their last rehearsal of their two plays. 

 The story of Los the Shepherd Boy, being in four parts, would either require a stage curtain and several changes of scenery or, as in our case, a very simple handling. Children,  the world over, love to dress up in discarded clothing or old pieces of cloth and work out their own plays. So it was decided to have the children put on the play just as they would if they were playing out in the orchard without any audience. 

 All but one child came on stage. One of them said, tWhat can we play? 

There's


<p472>
472             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  nothing to do around here!" 

 Another said, ~Paul is coming over with a new game for us." Then Paul came in carrying a bundle of old clothes and said, ~ found these things in the attic. Let's put on the play of los the 

Shepherd Boy." Another    

 child says, "Paul, why don't you tell the story again before we start the play?" 

 Then all of them sat down and Paul told in his own words the story of the simple shepherd boy who so longed to see the good and wise king of his land that he stood for hours by the road where he had heard the king was to pass, and refused to be driven away by the king's men. The king could not forget the boy who so loved him that his only wish was to gaze on his face, and he finally sent for ios to live in the castle. There the members of the king's court became  very jealous of the favors showered on los, and when they observed that every night at midnight los went to a tiny room in the tower and locked tile door, they went to the king and reported that no doubt ios was hiding jewels and money there and would later run away. That night the king and his court followed Tos to learn his secret. They then found that he went to this room only to put on his old shepherd's clothes and to meditate on the fact that he was a very humble man, and that all he had was what his beloved king had given him. 

 The king decided to test los and calling his court together they went for a ride. Suddenly the king emptied a box of jewels out cnto the sand. Everypne but los got down and hastily searched the sand for jewels.  los remained by the king's side. When the king asked him why he didn't pick up the jewels, los said, ~ King, I do not wish for wealth. I oniy want to stay by your side to gaze on your face and to guard you." The king was so convinced of los' sincerity that he appointed him to guard his only son. 

 On the palace grounds there was a lake with some very beautiful swans in it. The king loved these swans very much. 

 One day the king's son killed one of the swans with a bow and arrow and then quickly gave the bow to Los and ran away when he saw his father coming through the forest. Los refused to tell what had happened because he wished to spare the king the grief of knowing that his son had done this terrible thing. Although the king loved los so dearly, he felt he could no longer trust him and los was banished from the king's presence. 

 In time the ldng'~ son could no longer bear the burden on his conscience and he confessed  to his father that los was innocent. The king at once went to los' hut to bring him back, but long grieving had made los very ill and the king found him on his death bed. Supremely happy knowing the king loved him, los died after gazing lovingly on the king's face once more. 

 The story being told, the children jumped up and sorted out the clothes Paul had brought in, and put them on. Some of these were lengths of cloth and some parts of old costumes that had been stored at the Summer School. There was a long black coat for the king and a fine long stick for his royal sceptre. 

 los had a large piece of burlap to wrap around him and another long stick for his shepherd's crook. The king also carried a long stick for a sceptre. 

 Later a long blue coat was given to ios when he came to live in the castle. The king's men wore uniforms that were made of lengths of cloth with a neck opening cut in them so that they hung down an equal length front and back. The king's son also wore one of these with a short black jacket over it.    The box of jewels can be any small hard substance that will not roll when emptied out. We used paper clips and the audience was much amused. They enjoyed this unexpected  device because they knew it represented  the imaginative makeshifts children produce in their undirected play. 

 For scenery the children simply pointed to one corner of the stage and said, "That chair will be the shepherd's hut, and the one in this corner can be the castle." When a change of scene was required, they stopped and one said, "Now what comes next?", and someone else said, CCWhy don't you remember,  this is where The dialogue was written out by the teacher, but the children were not required to learn it word for word. They were allowed to change it as they wished. They did change it somewhat at each rehearsal and improved it immensely. 
They were also

  reassured that it would be all right if they needed to prompt each other the night of the play, as long as they did it simply, just as children would do if they were playing alone. 

 The audience went into gales of laughter when one of the youngsters had trouble getting his costume on and another child had to help him. It was so natural that some thought it had purposely been made part of the play. 

 'When the last act was finished they gathered in a group and said, ttThat was fun! Let's have Paul save these things for us so we can play it again." 

 Then one said, tCI wonder why 'Abdu'l-Baha told that story." Another said, 'Abdu'l-Baha said that Baha'u'llah was our spiritual king." Then they talked about it being necessary to be like los and iove Baha'u'llah more than jewels, and money, and to go alone once a day to remember that they had nothing of their own selves, that Baha'u'llah gave them everything. 

 Then they trooped off the stage, one of them saying, t~I'm hungry, let's go home to supper.~~ The children worked hard practicing for the play, and during the few days of preparation,  seeds of spiritual truth were sown that will inevitably bear fruit. 

 The junior yduth gave an entertainment another evening. 

 They demonstrated how Baha ethics could be applied to games to insure fair play. This they did by playing a game of quoits on the stage and then settling a dispute which arose. 

 Later they held a class session on the stage, with one of the girls acting as a new pupil. They were studying the CcDawn Breakers," and when the new member asked questions, they answered her by reading from the "Dawn Breakers" and the Bible; thus demonstrating the principle of independent investigation of the truth. 

 Then they dismissed the class to hold a party to which the audience was invited. 

 First the A B C game was played. This was to be in the form of quotations from ttHidden Words," and to be given in order of the alphabet. It was explained that the articles such as Ctth~~ need not be counted. For instance; the verse beginning "The bird," could be counted for the letter "b." Also the salutations need not be counted, and the letter "x" could be used in a word beginning with ~tcx~~ In a few cases, such as the letter C%,, it was necessary to find the word in the middle of the sentence. The audience entered into the spirit of it and found a verse for each letter, though many of the verses were not taken from the tcHid den Words." The class then posted a list of the verses, showing that the verses could all be found in the 

"Hidden Words."            

 A paper with a quotation from the Teachings  was then passed to every one with in —  structions to make the names of countries from the letters in this quotation. 

 The quotation used began "The world is but one country." 

 A prize was given to the one making the longest list of countries. The prizes offered were carrots, beautifully decorated with ribbons! 

 The entertainment wound up with a quiz program. 

 Invitations were passed out to about twenty-five of the audience. These friends were lined up and questioned by the children. The questions asked were such as this — "Who was the Seventeenth Letter of the Living? What was the name of the Twelfth Imim?" 

 This was a lot of fun for those who were privileged to look on. The grand prize given for this contest was a carrot combined with white paper, to make a beautiful calla lily. 

 The reward the children received for giving this evening's entertainment could only be guessed at by trying to estimate the value of such research work as the children had to do to make up their games and the quiz contest. 

 An immense amount of work can be accomplished  with a class that meets every day: but it was not all work for the children.  In the afternoon there was swimming in the river; educational and comedy films were rented for them; a weiner roast was held by the river, there were hikes in the hills and time for games in the orchards; nature study excursions were combined with class work. Some of the Geyserville residents sent their children to the Summer School, and one woman volunteered her services to assist with the nursery work. One very impressive thing was the children's love of singing. We would go down to class in the morning to find them singing as they set out the chairs, or to find a group singing


<p474>

  as they were waiting to be taken out on an excursion. 

 Several of them expressed a desire  for some new songs. 

 One mother was inspired to open a Summer  School for children in her home during vacation, and invited the neighbor children to attend mornings. 

 Two teachers can manage a group of this kind by alternating class periods. 

 One teaches the larger class while the nursery children receive instruction in handicraft; then the older children are taught handicraft while the nursery class is taught simple Baha'i ethics, such as kindness  to animals. However, it is much more successful to divide the children into at least three age groups. 

 Part of the bounty of teaching children is in the questions they ask, which must be written down in your notebook and looked up, in order to be sure they are given the correct answer. It is a highly technical and very responsible work to teach the Baha'i Faith to little children. 

 They must be given the correct outer teachings, and then in God's own time the inner teachings will be revealed to them. 

 New visual methods, new adaptations of old methods await the Baha'i teacher who will step into this almost entirely  unexplored field of teaching — unexplored and precious, this teaching of the Baha'i Faith to 'Abdu'l-Baha's children. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha said, "The education of children is one of the most great services. All these children are mine. If they are educated and illumined, it is as though my own children  were so characterized."

478              THE BAHA'I WORLD

B~ DOWAGER QUEEN MARIE     
OF RUMANIA                 

  I was deeply moved on reception of your letter. 

 Indeed a great light came to me with the message of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. It came as all great messages come at an hour of dire grief and inner conflict and distress,  so the seed sank deeply. 

 My youngest daughter finds also great strength and comfort in the teachings of the beloved masters. 

 We pass on the message from month to month and all those we give it to see a light suddenly lighting before them and much that was obscure and perplexing becomes  simple, luminous and full of hope as never before. 

 That my open letter was balm to those suffering for the cause, is indeed a great happiness to me, and I take it as a sign that God accepted my humble tribute. 

 The occasion given me to be able to express  myself publicly, was also His Work —  for indeed it was a chain of circumstances of which each link led me unwittingly one step further, till suddenly all was clear before  my eyes and I understood why it bad been. 

 Thus does He lead us finally to our ultimate  destiny. 

 Some of those of my caste wonder at and disapprove my courage to step forward pronouncing  words not habitual for Crowned Heads to pronounce, but I advance by an inner urge I cannot resist. With bowed head I recognize that I too am but an instrument  in greater Hands and reioice in the knowledge. 

 Little by little the veil is lifting, grief tore it in two. And grief was also a step leading me ever nearer truth, therefore do I not cry out against grief! 

 May you and those beneath your guidance be blessed and upheld by the sacred strength of those gone before you. 

 A woman1 brought me the other day a Book. I spell it with a capital letter because it is a glorious Book of love and goodness, strength and beauty. 

 She gave it to me because she had learned 'Miss Martha L. Root. — Editor. 

 I was in grief and sadness and wanted to help. She put it into my bands saying: c(You seem to live up to His teachings." And when I opened the Book I saw it was the word of 'Abdu'l-Baha, prophet of love and kindness, and of his father the great teacher of international goodwill and understanding  — of a religion which links all creeds. 

 Their writings are a great cry toward peace, reaching beyond all limits of frontiers, above all dissension about rites and dogmas. It is a religion based upon the inner spirit of God, upon the great, not-to-be-over-come verity that God is love, meaning just that. It teaches that all hatreds, intrigues, suspicions, evil words, all aggressive  patriotism even, are outside the one essential law of God, and that special beliefs are but surface things whereas the heart that beats with divine love knows no tribe nor race. 

 lit is a wondrous Message that Baha'u'llah and his son 'Abdu'l-Baha have given us. They have not set it up aggressively, knowing  that the germ of eternal truth which lies at its core cannot but take root and spread. 

 There is only one great verity in it: Love, the mainspring of every energy, tolerance toward each other, desire of understanding each other, knowing each other, helping each other, forgiving each other. 

     It is Christ's Message     

 taken up anew, in the same words almost, but adapted to the thousand years and more difference that lies between the year one and today. 

 No man could fail to be better because of this 

Book.                      
     I commend it to you all.   

 If ever the name of Baha'u'llah or 'Abdu'l-Baha comes to your attention, do not put their writings from you. Search out their Books, and let their glorious, peace-bringing, love-creating words and lessons sink into your hearts as they have into mine. 

 One's busy day may seem too full for religion. 

 Or one may tave a religion that satisfies. But the teachings of these gentle, wise and kindly men are compatible with all religion, and with no religion. 
     Seek them, and be the happier.

Star, May 4, 1926.)

  Of course, if you take the stand that creation has no aim, it is easy to dismiss life and death with a shrug and a "that ends it all; nothing comes after." 

 But how difficult it is so to dismiss the universe, our world, the animal and vegetable  world, and man. How clearly one sees a plan in everything. 

 How unthinkable it is that the miraculous development that has brought man's body, brain and spirit to what it is, should cease. Why should it cease? Why is it not logical that it goes on? Not the body, which is only an instrument, but the invisible spark or fire within the body which makes man one with the wider plan of creation. 

 My words are lame, and why should I grope for meanings When I can quote from one who has said it so much more plainly, 'Abdu'l-Baha, whom I know would sanction the use of his words: "The whole physical creation is perishable. Material bodies are composed of atoms. When these atoms begin to separate, decomposition sets in. Then comes what we call death. 

 c!This composition of atoms which constitutes the body or mortal element of any created being, is temporary. When the power of attraction which holds these atoms together is withdrawn, the body as such ceases to exist. 

 ""With the soui it is different. The soul is not a combination of elements, is not composed  of many atoms, is of one indivisible substance and therefore eternal. 

 "It is entirely out of the order of physical creation; it is immortal! 

 The soul, being an invisible, indivisible substance, can suffer  neither disintegration nor destruction. Therefore there is no reason for its coming to an end. 

 CCCd the aim of creation: is it possible  that all is created to evolve and develop through countless ages with merely this small goal in view — a few years of man's life on earth? 

 Is it not unthinkable that this should be the final aim of existence? 

 Does a man cease to exist when he leaves his body? If his life comes to an end, then all previous evolution is useless. All has been for nothing. 

 All those eons of evolution for nothing! Can we imagine that creation had no greater aim than this? 

 "The very existence of man's intelligence proves his immortality. His intelligence is the intermediary between his body and his spirit. When man allows his spirit, through his soul, to enlighten his understanding, then does he contain all creation; because man being  the culmination of all that went before, and thus superior to all previous evolutions, contains all the lower already-evolved world within himself. 

 Illumined by the spirit through the instrumentality of the soui, man's radiant intelligence makes him the crowning-point of creation!" 

 Thus does 'Abdu'l-Baha explain to us the soul — the most convincing elucidation I know. 

(From the Toronto Daily   
Star, September 28, 1926.)

  At first we all conceive of God as something  or somebody apart from ourselves. We think He is something or somebody definite, outside of us, whose quality, meaning and so-to-say ccpersona1ity~~ we can grasp with our human, finite minds, and express in mere words. 

 This is not so. We cannot, with our earthly faculties entirely grasp His meaning — no more than we can really understand the meaning of Eternity. 

 God is certainly not the old Fatherly gentleman with the long beard that in our childhood we saw pictured sitting amongst clouds on the throne of judgment, holding the lightning of vengeance in His hand. 

 God is something simpler, happier, and yet infinitely more tremendous. God is All Everything. He is the power behind all beginnings. 

 He is the inexhaustible source of supply, of love, of good, of progress, of achievement. God is therefore Happiness. 

 His is the voice within us that shows us good and evil. 

 But mostly we ignore or misunderstand this voice. 

 Therefore did lie choose his Elect to come down amongst us upon earth to make clear His word, His real meaning. Therefore the Prophets; therefore Christ, Muhammad, Baha'u'llah, for man needs from

  time to time a voice upon earth to bring God to him, to sharpen the realization of the existence  of the true God. Those voices sent to us had to become flesh, so that with our earthly ears we should be able to hear and understand. 

 Those who read their Bible with "peeled eyes" will find in almost every line some revelation. 

 But it takes long life, suffering or some sudden event to tear all at once the veil from our eyes, so that we can truly see. 

 Sorrow and suffering are the surest and a.~so the most common instructors, the straightest channel to God — that is to say, to that inner something within each of us which is God. 

 Happiness beyond all understanding comes with this revelation that God is within us, if we will but listen to His voice. We need not seek Him in the clouds. 

 He is the All-Father whence we came and to whom we shall return when, having done with this earthly body, we pass onward. 

 If I have repeated myself, forgive me. There are so many ways of saying things, but what is important is the truth which lies in all the many ways of expressing it. (From the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, Monday, September 27, 1926.) 

  trLately a great hope has come to me from one, 'Abdu'l-Baha. I have found in His and His Father, 

Baha'u'llah's Message      

 of Faith all my yearning for real religion satisfied. 

 If you ever hear of Baha'is or of the Baha'i Movement which is known in America, you will know what that is. 'What I mean: these Books have strengthened me beyond belief and I am now ready to die any day full of hope. But I pray God not to take me away yet for I still have a lot of work to do." 

  tcThe Baha'i teaching brings peace and understanding. 

 "It is like a wide embrace gathering together  all those who have long searched for words of hope. 

 "Jr accepts all great prophets gone before, it destroys no other creeds and leaves all doors open. 

 "Saddened by the continual strife amongst believers of many confessions and wearied by their intolerance towards each other, I discovered in the Baha'i teaching the real spirit of Christ so often denied and misunderstood: ~tUnity instead of strife, hope instead of condemnation, love instead of hate, and a great reassurance for all men. 

  "The Baha'i teaching brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart. 

 CCT those in search of assurance the words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering." 
1934.                     

  "More than ever tpday when the world is facing such a crisis of bewilderment and unrest, must we stand firm in Faith seeking that which binds together instead of tearing asunder." 

 CCTO those searching for light, the Baha'i Teachings offer a star which will lead them to deeper understanding, to assurance, peace and good will with all men." 
1936.                     

  B~ PROFESSOR E. G. BROWNE, M.A., M.B. 

Introduction to Myron     

 H. Phelps' 'Abbas Eftendi, pages xi-xx; 1903 rev. 1912 —  I have often heard wonder expressed by Christian ministers at the extraordinary success of BThi missionaries, as contrasted with the almost complete failure of their own. (CHOW is it," they say, "that the Christian doctrine, the highest and the noblest which the world has ever known, though supported by all the resources of 'Western civilization, can only count its converts in Mu-bammadan  lands by twos and threes, while B4biism can reckon them by thousands?" The answer, to my mind, is plain as the sun at midday. 

 Western Christianity, save in the rarest cases, is more 'Western than Christian, more racial than religious; and by dallying with doctrines plainly incompatible with the obvious meaning of its Founder's words, such as the theories of tcracial supremacy, imperial destiny," "survival of the fittest," and the like, grows steadily more rather than less

  material. Did Christ belong to a "dominant race," or even to a European or C~white race'~? 

 I am not arguing that the Christian religion is true, but merely that it is in manifest  conflict with several other theories of life which practically regulate the conduct of all States and most individuals in the Western world, a world which, on the whole, judges all things, including religions, mainly by material, or to use the more popular term, "practical," standards. 

 There is, of course, another factor in the success of the Bab propagandist, as compared with the Christian missionary, in the conversion of Muhaznmadans to his faith: namely, that the former admits, while the latter rejects, the Divine inspiration of the Qur'an and the prophetic function of Muliiammad. 

 The Christian missionary must begin by attacking, explicitly or by implication, both these beliefs; too often forgetting that if (as happens  but rarely) he succeeds in destroying them, he destroys with them that recognition  of former prophetic dispensations (in-cluding  the Jewish and the Christian) which Muhammad and the Qur'an proclaim, and converts his Muslim antagonist not to Christianity, but to Skepticism or Atheism. What, indeed, could be more illogical on the part of Christian missionaries to Mul?amma-dan lands than to devote much time and labor to the composition of controversial works which endeavor to prove, in one and the same breath, first, that the Qur'an is a lying imposture, and, secondly, that it bears witness to the truth of Christ's mission, as though any value attached to the testimony of one proved a liar! The Mbi (or Baha'i) propagandist, on the other hand, admits that Muhammad was the prophet of God and that the Qur'an is the Word of God, denies nothing  but their finality, and does not discredit his own witness when he draws from that source arguments to prove his faith. To the Western observer, however, it is the complete sincerity of the Mbis, their fearless disregard of death and torture undergone for the sake of their religion, their certain conviction  as to the truth of their faith, their generally admirable conduct towards mankind  and especially towards their fellow believers, which constitutes their strongest claim on his attention. 

Introduction to Myron      

 H. Phelps' 'Abbas Effendi, pages xii-xiv —  It was under the influence of this enthusiasm  that I penned the introduction to my translation of the Traveller's 

Narrative.                 

 This enthusiasm condoned, if not shared, by many kindly critics and reviewers, exposed me to a somewhat savage attack in the Oxford Magazine, an attack concluding with the assertion that my Introduction displayed "a personal attitude almost inconceivable in a rational European, and a style unpardonable in a university teacher." 

 (The review in question appeared in the Oxford Magazine of May 25, 1892, page 394, "the prominence given to the Mb in this book is an absurd violation of historical perspective; and the translations of the Traveller's Narrative a waste of the powers and opportunities of a Persian 

Scholar.") Increasing      

 age and experience (more's the pity!) are apt enough, even without the assistance of the Oxford Magazine, to modify our enthusiasm; but in this case, at least, time has so far vindicated my judgment against that of my Oxford reviewer that he could scarcely now maintain, as he formerly asserted, that the B&bi religion tthad affected the least important part of the Muslim World and that not deeply." Every one who is in the slightest degree conversant with the actual state of things (September 27, 1903), in Persia now recognizes that the number and influence of the BThis in that country is immensely greater than it was fifteen years ago. 

  A  Traveller's Narrative, page 3 09 —  The appearance of such a woman as Qurratu'1-'Ayn is in any country and any age a rare phenomenon, but in such a country  as Persia it is a prodigy — nay, almost a miracle. Alike in virtue of her marvelous beauty, her rare intellectual gifts, her fervid eloquence, her fearless devotion and her glorious martyrdom, she stands forth incomparable and immortal amidst her countrywomen.  Had the Mbi religion no other claim to greatness, this were sufficient — that it produced a heroine like Qurratu'1-'Ayn.

Introduction to A Traveller's

 Narrative, pages ix, x —  Though I dimly suspected whither I was going and whom I was to behold (for no distinct intimation had been given to me), a second or two elapsed ere, with a throb of wonder and awe, I became definitely conscious that the room was not untenanted. In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt headdress of the kind called t4j by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jetblack hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. 

 No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object  of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain. 

 A mild, dignified voice bade me be seated, and then continued: Praise be to God, that thou List attained! Thou hast came to see a prisoner and an exile. We desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; yet they deem us a stirrer-uf of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment. 

 That all nations should become one in path and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between  the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled — what harm is there in this? Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the ~Most Great Peace' shall come. Do not you in Europe need this also? Is not this that which Christ foretold? 

 •      Yet  do we see your kings and rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the destruction of the Innnan race than on that which would conduce to the happiness  of mankind. 

 These strifes and this bloodshed and discard must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family. 

 Let not a man glory in this that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this: that he loves his kind. 

 Such, so far as I can recall them, were the words which, besides many others, I heard from Baha Let those who read them consider well with themselves whether such doctrines merit death and bonds, and whether the world is more likely to gain or lose by their diffusion. 
                           
Introduction to A Traveller's

 Narrative, pages xxxv, xxxvi —  Seldom have I seen one whose appearance impressed me more. A tall, strongly built man holding himself straight as an arrow, with white turban and raiment, long black locks reaching almost to the shoulder, broad powerful forehead, indicating a strong intellect,  combined with an unswerving will, eyes keen as a hawk's and strongly marked but pleasing features — such was my first impression  of 'Abbas Effendi, ttThe Master" ('AghA) as he par excellence is called by the B~bis. 

 Subsequent conversation with him served oniy to heighten the respect with which his appearance had from the first inspired me. One more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration,  more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians and the Muhammadans, could, I should think, be scarcely found even amongst the eloquent, ready and subtle race to which he belongs. These qualities, combined with a bearing at once majestic and genial, made me cease to wonder at the influence and esteem which he enjoyed even beyond the circle of his father's followers. 

 About the greatness of this man and his power no one who had seen him could entertain a doubt.

  in 1850.     It, too, claims to be a universal teaching; it has already its noble army of martyrs and its holy books; has Persia, in the midst of her miseries, given birth to a religion which will go round the world? 

  B~ THE REV. T. K. CHEYNE, D. LITT., D.D. 

Excerpts from The Reconciliation

 of Races and Religions, (1914) —  There was living quite lately a human being' of such consummate excellence that many think it is both permissible and inevitable  even to identify him mystically with the invisible Godhead. 

 His2 combination  of mildness and power is so rare that we have to place him in a line with supernormal men. We learn that, at great points in his career after he had been in an ecstasy, such radiance of might and majesty streamed from his countenance that none could bear to look upon the, effulgence of his glory and beauty. 

 Nor was it an uncommon occurrence for unbelievers involuntarily  to bow down in iowiy obeisance on beholding His Holiness. 

 The gentle spirit of the Mb is surely high up in the cycles of eternity. 

 Who can fail, as Professor Browne says, to be attracted by him? CCHis sorrowful and persecuted life; his purity of conduct and youth; his courage and uncomplaining patience under misf or-tune;  his complete self-negation; the dim ideal of a better state of things which can be discerned throu'gh the obscure mystic utterances of the Baydn; but most of all, his tragic death, all serve to enlist our sympathies  on behalf of the young prophet of $hiriz."

 If there has been any prophet in recent times, it is to Baha'u'llah that we must go. Character is the final judge. Baha'u'llah was a man of the highest class — that of prophets. 

  'Baha'u'llah. 

 B&b. But he was free from the last infirmity of noble minds, and would certainly not have separated himself from others. He would have understood the saying: tWould God all the Lord's people were prophets!" 

 What he does say, however, is just as fine: "I do not desire lordship over others; I desire all men to be even as I am." 

 The day is not far off when the details of 'Abdu'l-Baha's missionary journeys will be admitted to be of historical importance. How gentle and wise he was, hundreds could testify from personal knowledge, and I, too, could perhaps say something. 

 I will oniy, however, give here the outward framework  of 'Abdu'l-Baha's life, and of his apostolic journeys, with the help of my friend Lutfull&h.... During his stay in London he visited Oxford  (where he and his party — of Persians mainly — were the guests of Professor and Mrs. Cheyne), Edinburgh, 

Clifton and Woking. It     

 is fitting to notice here that the audience at Oxford, though highly academic, seemed to be deeply interested, and that Dr. Carpenter made an admirable speech.

 The loving epistle which you have condescended to write to this servant, and the rug which you have forwarded, came safely to hand. The time of the meeting with your Excellency, and the memory of the benediction  of your presence, recurred to the memory of this servant, and I am longing for the time when I shall meet you again. Although I have traveled through many countries and cities of IsUm, yet have I never met so lofty a character and so exalted a personage as your Excellency, and I can bear witness that it is not possible to find such another. On this account, I am hoping that the ideals and ac

  complishments of your Excellency may be crowned with success and yield results under all conditions; because behind these ideals and deeds I easily discern the eternal welfare and prosperity of the world of humanity. 

 This servant, in order to gain firsthand information and experience, entered into the ranks of various religions, that is, outwardly, I became a Jew, Christian, 

Muhanmadan and Zoroastrian.

 I discovered that the devotees  of these various religions do nothing else but hate and anathematize each other, that all their religions have become the instruments  of tyranny and oppression in the hands of rulers and governors, and that they are the causes of the destruction of the world of humanity. 

 Considering those evil results, every person is forced by necessity to enlist himself on the side of your Excellency, and accept with joy the prospect of a fundamental basis for a universal religion of God, being laid through your efforts. 

 I have seen the father of your Excellency from afar. I have realized the self-sacrifice and noble courage of his son, and I am lost in admiration. 

 For the principles and aims of your Excellency, I express the utmost respect and devotion, and if God, the Most High, confers  long life, I will be able to serve you under all conditions. 

 I pray and supplicate this from the depths of my heart.

(The Revival of BAbiismQ —  When one has been like Sa'id, a great personage,  and then a common soldier, and then a prisoner of a Christian feudal chief; when one has worked as a navvy on the fortifications of the Count of Antioch, and wandered back afoot to Shir&z after infinite pain and labor, he may well be disposed to think that nothing that exists is real, or, at least, has any substantial reality worth clinging to. Today the public peace of Persia is no longer subject to such violent perturbations. 

 At least, as far as we are concerned, the appearances of peace prevail, and few of us care or have occasion to. look beyond the appearances.  But for the Persians themselves, have the conditions very much changed? Do they not witness one day the sudden rise of this or that favorite of fortune and the next day his sudden fall? 

 Have they not seen the At~bak-i-A'zam twice hold sway as the SMh's all-powerful Vazir, and twice hurled down from that pinnacle by a bolt from the blue? How many other ministers and governors have sat for a time on the sears of the mighty and been swept away by some intrigue as sordid as that to which they owed their own exaltation? 

 And how many in humbler stations have been in the meantime the recipients of their unworthy favors or the victims of their arbitrary oppression? 

 A village which but yesterday was fairly prosperous is beggared today by some neighboring landlord higher up the valley, who, having duly propitiated those in authority, diverts for the benefit of his own estates the whole of its slender suppiy of water. 

 The progress of a governor or royal prince, with all his customary retinue of ravenous hangers-on, eats out the countryside through which it passes more effectually than a flight of locusts. 

 The visitation is as ruinous and as unaccountable. 

 Is it not the absence of all visible moral correlation of cause and effect in these phenomena of daily life that has gone far to produce the stolid fatalism of the masses, the scoffing skepticism  of the more educated classes, and from time to time the revolt of some nobler minds?

 one of the most interesting features  of B~ibiism is the raising of woman to a much higher plane than she is usually admitted to in the East. The ]3~b himself had no more devoted a disciple than the beautiful and gifted lady, known as Qurratu'1-'Ayn,  the ccc it of the Eyes," who, having shared all the dangers of the first apostolic missions in the north, challenged and suffered death with virile fortitude, as one of the Seven Martyrs of Tihr4n. No memory is more deeply venerated or kindles greater enthusiasm than hers, and the influence which she yielded in her lifetime still inures to her sex.

Quotation from The Fringe 

 of the East, (Macmillan & Co., London, 1913.) —  Bah&'iism is now estimated to count more than two million adherents, mostly composed  of Persian and Indian $hi'ihs, but including  also many Sunnis from the Turkish Empire and North Africa, and not a few Brahmans, Buddhists, Taoists, Shintoists and Jews. 

 It possesses even European converts, and has made some headway in the United States. 

 Of all the religions which have been encountered in the course of this journey —  the stagnant pools of Oriental Christianity, the strange survivals of sun-worship, and idolatry tinged with Muhammadanism, the immutable relic of the Sumerians — it is the only one which is alive, which is aggressive, which is extending its frontiers, instead of secluding itself within its ancient haunts. It is a thing which may revivify Isl4m, and make great changes on the face of the Asiatic world.

  (Excerpt from an article by Louise Drake W;ight.) 

 When spending the winters of 19067 in Alassio, Italy, I often met the late professor Lewis Campbell, professor of Greek in the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, for many years, who was an eminent pupil of Dr. Benjamin Jowett, late master of 

Balliol College and Professor

 of Greek in the University of Oxford, also Doctor of Theology of the University of Leyden, Holland. 

         Because of Professor Campbell's

 profound spiritual and intellectual attainments he was highly honored as one who spoke with truthful  authority and his noted translations of Greek poetry endeared him to all. From him I first heard of the Baha'i Revelation, the significance of which had been indelibly impressed  upon him by Dr. Jowett's deep convictions concerning it, and I wrote down some very telling sentences which Professor Campbell quoted from Dr. Jowett's words to him.

  It has been given literary expression in a veritable library of Asiatic, European, and American works to which additions are annually made as the movement grows and grapples with the great problems that grow out of its cardinal teachings. 

 It has a long roll of martyrs for the cause for which it stands, twenty thousand in Persia alone, proving it to be a movement worth dying for as well as worth living by. 

 From its inception it has been identified with Baha'u'llah, who paid the price of ipro-longed  exile, imprisonment, bodily suffering, and mental anguish for the faith He cherished  — a man of imposing personality as revealed in His writings, characterized by intense moral earnestness and profound spirituality, gifted with the selfsame power so conspicuous in the character of Jesus, the power to appreciate people ideally, that is, to see them at the level of their best and to make even the lowest types think well of themselves because of potentialities within them to which He pointed, but of which they were wholly unaware; a prophet whose greatest contribution was not any specific doctrine He proclaimed, but an informing  spiritual power breathed into the world through the example of His life and thereby quickening souis into new spiritual activity. 

 Surely a movement of which all this can be said deserves — nay, compels —  our respectful recognition and sincere appreciation. 

 Taking precedence over all else in its gospel is the message of unity in religion. 

 •    It is the crowning glory of the Baha'i movement that, while deprecating sectarianism  in its preaching, it has faithfully practiced what it preached by +efraining from becoming itself a sect. Its representatives do not attempt to impose any beliefs upon others, whether by argument or bribery;  rather do they seek to put beliefs that have illumined their own lives within the reach of those who feel they need illumina-don. 

 No, not a sect, not a part of humanity  cut off from all the rest, living for itself and aiming to convert all the rest into material  for its own growth; no, not that, hut a leaven, causing spiritual fermentation in all religions, quickening them with the spirit of catholicity and fraternalism. 

 •Who shall say but that just as the little company of the Mayflower, landing on Plymouth Rock, proved to be the small beginning of a mighty nation, the ideal germ of a democracy which, if true to its principles,  shall yet overspread the habitable globe, so the little company of Baha'is exiled from their Persian home may yet prove to be the small beginning of the worldwide movement, the ideal germ of democracy in religion,  the Universal

But the last century which marks the end of Persia has had its revival and twofold revival, literary and religious. The funeral ceremonies by which Persia celebrates  every year for centuries — the fatal day of the 10th of Muharram, when the son of 'Au breathed his last at Karbil& — have developed a popular theater and produced a sincere poetry, dramatic and human, which is worth all the rhetoric of the poets. During the same times an attempt at religious renovation was made, the religion of BAbjism. Demoralized for centuries by ten foreign conquests, by the yoke of a composite religion  in which she believed just enough to persecute, by the enervating influence of a mystical philosophy which disabled men for action and divested life of all aim and objects,  Persia has been making unexpected efforts for the last fifty-five years to remake for herself a virile ideal. BAbjism has little of originality in its dogmas and mythology. Its mystic doctrine takes its rise from $~fism and the old sects of the 'Aijides formed around the dogma of divine incarnation. But the morality it inculcates is a revolution. It has the ethics of the West. 

 It suppresses lawful impurities which are a great barrier dividing 

Isl4m from Christendom.    

 It denounces  polygamy, the fruitful source of

  Oriental degeneration. 

 It seeks to reconstitute the family and it elevates man and in elevating him exalts woman up to his level. B~biism, which diffused itself in less than five years from one end of Persia to another, which was bathed in 1852 in the blood of its martyrs, has been silently progressing and propagating itself. 

 If Persia is to be at all regenerate it will be through this new faith.

Excerpts from Contemporary 

 Studies, Part Ill, page 131. (Allen & Unwin, London, 1924.) —  'We Westerners are too apt to imagine that the huge continent of Asia is sleeping as soundly as a mummy. We smile at the vanity  of the ancient Hebrews, who believed themselves to be the chosen people. 

 We are amazed at the intolerance of the Greeks and Romans, who looked upon the members of all races as barbarians. 

 Nevertheless, we ourselves are like the Hebrews, the Greeks and the Romans. 

 As Europeans we believed Europe to be the only world that matters, though from time to time we may turn a paternal eye towards America, regarding our offspring in the New World with mingled feelings of condescension and pride. 

 Nevertheless, the great cataclysm of 1914 is leading some of us to undertake a critical examination of the inviolable dogma that the European nations are the elect. Has there not been of late years a demonstration of the nullity of modern civilization — the nullity which had already been proclaimed by Rousseau, Garlyle, Ruskin, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche? We are now inclined to listen more attentively to whispers from the East. Our self-complacency has been disturbed by such utterances as that of Rabindranath Tagore, who, lecturing at the Imperial University  of Tokio on June 18, 1916, foretold a great future for Asia. 

 The political civilization of Europe was tccarnivorous and cannibalistic  in its tendencies." The East was patient, and could afford to wait till the West, tthurry after the expedient," had to halt for the want of breath. "Europe, while busily speeding to her engagements, disdain. fully casts her glance from her carriage window  at the reaper reaping his harvest in the field, and in her intoxication of speed, cannot but think him as slow and ever receding backwards. But the speed comes to its end, the engagement loses its meaning, and the hungry heart clamors for food, till at last she comes to the loAely reaper reaping his harvest in the sun. For if the office cannot wait, or the buying and selling, or the craving for excitement — love waits, and beauty, and the wisdom of suffering and the fruits of patient devotion and reverent meekness of simple faith. And thus shall wait the East till her time comes." 

 Being thus led to turn our eyes towards Asia, we are astonished to find how much we have misunderstood it; and we blush when we realize our previous ignorance of the fact that, towards the middle of the nineteenth century, Asia gave birth to a great religious movement — a movement signalized for its spiritual purity, one which has had thousands of martyrs, one which Tolstoy has described. 

 H. Dreyfus, the French historian of this movement, says that it is not "a new religion,"  but "religion renewed," and that it provides "the only possible basis for a mutual understanding between religion and free thought." Above all, we are impressed by the fact that, in our own time, such a manifestation can occur, and that the new faith should have undergone a development far more extensive than that undergone in the same space of time nearly two thousand years ago, by budding Christianity. 

 At the present time, the majority of the inhabitants of Persia have, to a varying extent, accepted the ]lThiist faith. In the great towns of Europe, America, and Asia, there are active centers for the propaganda of the liberal ideas and the doctrine of human  community, which form the foundations of BaM'iist teaching. 

 We shall not grasp the full significance of this tendency until we pass from the description of BaM'iism as a theory to that of Bah&'iism as a practice, for the core of religion  is not metaphysics, but morality. 

 The Bah~i'iist ethical code is dominated by the law of love taught by Jesus and by all the prophets. 

 In the thousand and one details  of practical life, this law is subject to manifold interpretations. 

 That of Baha'u'llah  is unquestionably one of the most corn


<p488>
488            THE BAHA'I WORLD

  prehensive of these, one of the most exalted, one of the most satisfactory to the modern mind. 

 That is why Baha'u'llah is a severe critic of the patriotism which plays so large a part in the national life of our day. Love of our native land is legitimate, but this love must not be exclusive. A man should iove his country more than he loves his house (this is the dogma held by every patriot); but Baha'u'llah adds that he should love the divine world more than he loves his country. From this standpoint, patriotism is seen to be an intermediate stage on the road of renunciation,  an incomplete and hybrid religion, something we have to get beyond. Throughout his life Baha'u'llah regarded the ideal universal peace as one of the most important of his aims. 

 Baha'u'llah is in this respect enunciating  a novel and fruitful idea. 

 There is a better way of dealing with social evils than by trying to cure them after they have come to pass. We should try to prevent them by removing their causes, which act on the individual,  and especially on the child. Nothing can be more plastic than the nature of the child. 

 The government's first duty must be to provide for the careful and efficient education  of children, remembering that education is something more than instruction. This will be an enormous step towards the solution of the social problem, and to take such a step will be the first task of the Baytu'1 — 'Ad'1 (House of Justice). ttlt is ordained  upon every father to rear his son or his daughter by means of the sciences, the arts, and all the commandments, and if any one should neglect to do s5, then the mem-hers  of the council, should the offender be a wealthy man, must levy from him the sum necessary for the education of his child. When the neglectful parent is poor, the cost of the necessary education must be borne by the council, which will provide a refuge for the unfortunate." 

 The Baytu'1-'Ad'1, likewise, must prepare the way for the establishment of universal peace, doing this by organizing courts of arbitration and by influencing the governments. 

 Long before the Esperantists had begun their campaign, and more than twenty years before Nicholas II had summoned moned the first Hague congress, Baha'u'llah was insisting on the need for a universal language and courts of arbitration. 

 He returns  to these matters again and again: "Let all the nations become one in faith, and let all men be brothers, in order that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men may be strengthened. 

 What harm can there be in that? It is going to happen.  There will be an end to sterile conflicts,  to ruinous wars; and the Great Peace will come!" Such were the words of RaM'-u'lUh  in 1890, two years before his death. 

 While adopting and developing the Christian  law of iove, Baha'u'llah rejected the Christian principle of ascetism. He discountenanced the macerations which were a nightmare of the Middle Ages, and, whose evil effects persist even in our own days. 

 BaM'iism, then, is an ethical system, a system of social morality. But it would be a mistake to regard BahA'iist teaching as a collection of abstract rules imposed from without. 

 BaM'iism is permeated with a sane and noble mysticism; nothing could be more firmly rooted in the inner life, more benignly  spiritual; nothing could speak more intimately to the soui, in low tones, and as if from within. 

 Such is the new voice that sounds to us from Asia; such is the new dawn in the East. We should give them our close attention; we should abandon our customary mood of disdainful superiority. Doubtless, Baha'u'llah's teaching is not definitive. The Persian prophet does not offer it to us as such. Nor can we Europeans assimilate all of it; for modern science leads us to make certain claims in matters of thought — claims we cannot relinquish, claims we should not try to forego. 

 But even though Baha'u'llah's precepts (like those of the Gospels) may not fully satisfy all these intellectual demands, they are rarely in conflict with our scientific outlooks. If they are to became our own spiritual food, they must be supplemented, they must be relived by the religious spirits of Europe, must be rethought by minds schooled in the Western mode of thought. But in its existing form, BaM'iist teaching may serve, amid our present chaos, to open for us a road leading to solace and to comfort;  may' restore our confidence in the spir

(The Parliament  Publishing

 We are rising gradually toward that image, and we owe to our fellowmen to aid them in returning to it in the Glory of God and the Beauty of Holiness. 

 It is a celestial privilege and with it comes a high responsibility, from which there is no escape. 

 In the Palace of Baha'i, or Delight, just outside the Fortress of 'Akka, on the Syrian coast, there died a few months since, a famous  Persian sage, the B~bi Saint, named Baha'u'llah — the "Glory of God" — the head of that, vast reform party of Persian Mus-urns,  who accept the New Testament as the Word of God and Christ as the Deliverer of men, who regard all, nations as one, and all men as brothers. Three years ago he was visited by a Cambridge scholar and gave utterance to sentiments so noble, so Christlike, that we repeat them as our closing words: "That all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bands of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religions should cease and differences of race be annulled. What harm is there in this? Yet so it shall be. These fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the tMost Great Peace' shalt come. Do not you in Europe need this also?

  Excerpts from Persia, Vol. I, pages 496504. 

(Written in 1892.) —  Beauty 

 and the female sex also lent their consecration to the new creed and the heroism of the lovely but ill-fated poetess of Qazyin, Zarrin-Thj (Crown of Gold) or Quarratu'1-'Ayn (Solace of the Eyes), who, throwing off the veil, carried the missionary torch far and wide, is one of the most affecting episodes in modern history. 

 The lowest estimate places the present number  of B&bis in Persia at half a million. I am disposed to think, from conversations with persons well qualified to judge, that the total is nearer one million. 

 They are to be found in every walk of life, from the ministers and nobles of the Court to the scavenger or the groom, not the least arena in their activity being the Mussulman priesthood itself. It will have been noticed that the movement was initiated by Siyyids, I3Ajis and Muihis, i.e., persons who, either by desaent, from pious inclination, or by profession, were intimately concerned with the Mi4xammadan creed; and it is among even the professed votaries of the faith that they continue to make their converts. 

 Quite recently the Bab's have had great success in the camp of another enemy, having  secured many proselytes among the Jewish  populations of the Persian towns. 

 I hear that during the past year (1891) they are reported to have made 1 ~O Jewish converts in Tihr~n, 100 in Hamad&n, SO in K&sh4n, and 75 per cent of the Jews at GulpAyigAn. 

 The two victims, whose names were TLiji Mirza 

Hasan and 1j4ji Mirza      

 Ijusayn, have been renamed by the B~bis: Suldnu'sh-$huhad4', or King of Martyrs, and Mab-biibu'sh-$irshadA', or Beloved of Martyrs —  and their naked graves in the cemetery have become places of pilgrimage where many a tear is shed over the fate of the ttMartyrs of It is these little incidents, protruding from time to time their ugly features, that prove Persia to be not as yet quite redeemed, and that somewhat staggers  the tall-talkers about fr~nian civiliza-don.

  has been forced upon our notice by the retrospect in which I have indulged, it is that a sublime and murmuring [?3 devotion has been inculcated by this new faith, whatever  it be. There is, I believe, but one instance  of a ]3&b'i having recanted under pressure of menace of suffering, md he reverted to the faith and was executed within two years. 

 Tales of magnificent heroism illumine the bloodstained pages of Bab history. 

 Ignorant and unlettered as many of its votaries are, and have been, they are yet prepared to die for their religion, and fires of Smithfield did not kindle a nobler courage than has met and defied the more refined  torture-mongers of TihrAn. Of no small account, then, must be the tenets of a creed that can awaken in its followers so rare and beautiful a spirit of self-sacrifice. From the facts that EAbjism in its earliest years found itself in conflict with the civil powers and that an attempt was made by E4bis upon the life of the ShAh, it has been wrongly inferred that the movement was political in origin and Nihilist in character. 

 It does not appear from a study of the writings either of the B~b or his successor, that there is any foundation for such a suspicion. The charge of immorality seems to have arisen partly from malignant inventions of opponents,  partly from the much greater freedom  claimed for women by the Bib, which in the oriental mind is scarcely dissociable from profligacy of conduct. If B~biism continues to grow at its present rate of progression, a time may conceivably come when it will oust Muixammadanism from the field in Persia. Since its recruits are won from the best soldiers of the garrison whom it is attacking, there is greater reason to believe that it may ultimately prevail. 

 The pure and suffering life of the Rib, his ignominious death, the heroism and martyrdom  of his followers, will appeal to many others who can find no similar phenomena in the contemporaneous records of IsUm.

Excerpts from The Glean;.  

 (1923.) —  The story of the Mb, as Mirza 'Au-Mu-$ammad called himself, was the story of spiritual heroism unsurpassed in Svabhava's experience; and his own adventurous soul was fired by it. That a youth of no social influence and no education should, by the simple power of insight, be able to pierce into the heart of things and see the real truth, and then hold on to it with such firmness  of conviction and present it with such suasion that he was able to convince men that he was the Messiah and get them to follow him to death itself, was one of those splendid facts in human history that Svabhava loved to meditate on. This was a true hero whom he would wish to emulate and whose experiences he would profit by. The B&b's passionate sincerity could not be doubted, for he had given his life for his faith. And that there must be something in his message that appealed to men and satisfied their souls, was witnessed to by the fact that thousands gave their lives in his cause and millions now follow him. 

 If a young man could, in oniy six years of ministry, by the sincerity of his purpose and the attraction of his personality, so inspire rich and poor, cultured and illiterate, alike, with belief in himself and his doctrines that they would remain staunch, though hunted down and without trial sentenced to death, sawn asunder, strangled, shot, blown from guns; and if men of high position and culture  in Persia, Turkey and Egypt in numbers to this day adhere to his doctrines, his life must be one of those events in the last hundred years which is really worth study. And that study fortunately has been made by the Frenchman Gobineau and by Professor E. G. Browne, so that we are able to have a faithful representation of its main features. 

 Thus, in only his thirtieth year, in the year 1 8 50, ended the heroic career of a true God-man. 

 Of the sincerity of his conviction  that he was God-appointed, the manner of his death is the amplest possible proof. In the belief that he would thereby save others from the error of their present beliefs he willingly sacrificed his life. And of his power of attaching men to him, the passionate  devotion of hundreds and even thousands of men who gave their lives in his cause is corn4ncing testimony.

 The One to come would reveal all mysteries and all riddles. This was the humility of true insight. 
And it has had its effect. 

 His movement has grown and expanded, and it has yet a great future before it. During his six years of ministry, four of which were spent in captivity, he had permeated  all Persia with his ideas. 

 And since his death the movement has spread to Turkey,  Egypt, India and even into Europe and America. His adherents are now numbered by millions.

Excerpt from Modern Mystics.
(1935, p. 142.)            

 The martyrdom of the 13Th took place on July 9, 1850, thirty-one years from the date of his birth. 

 His body was dead. His spirit lived on. Ijusayn had been slain in battle. 

 Qudd~s had been done to death in captivity. But Baha'u'llah lived. The One who shall be made manifest was alive. 

 And in him and in others had been engendered such iovc for the Bab and what he stood for as, in the words of the chronicler, no eye had ever beheld  nor mortal heart conceived: if branches of every tree were turned into pens, and all the seas into ink, and Earth and Heaven rolled into one parchment, the immensity of that love would still remain untold. 

 This love for the Cause still survived. And it was sufficient. Baha'u'llah was, indeed, despoiled of his possessions, deserted by his friends, driven into exile from his native land andr even in exile, confined to his house. But in him the Cause was still alive — and more than alive, purified and ennobled by the fiery trials through which it had passed. 

 Under the wise control, and direction of Baha'u'llah from his prison-house, first at Bazhd~d and then at 'Akka in Syria, there grew what is now known as the Baha'i Movement which, silently propagating itself, has now spread to Europe and America as well as to India and Egypt, while the bodily remains of the Mb, long secretly guarded, now find a resting place on Mount Carmel in a Tomb-shrine, which is a place of pilgrimage to visitors from all over the world. 
                           
Excerpt from The Christian 
Commonwealth, January      

 22, 1913: "'Abdu'l-Baha at Oxford"  —  'Abdu'l-Baha addressed a large and deeply interested audience at Manchester College, Oxford, on December 31. The Persian leader spoke in his native tongue, Mirza Ahmad Solirab interpreting. Principal Estlin Carpenter  presided, and introduced the speaker by saying that they owed the honor and pleasure of meeting 'Abdu'l-Baha to their revered friend, Dr. Cheyne, who was deeply interested in the Baha'i teaching. 

 The movement  sprung up during the middle of the last century in Persia, with the advent of a young Mu1~ammadan who took to himself the title of the B~b (meaning door or gate, through which men could arrive at the knowledge or truth of God), and who commenced  teaching in Persia in the year 1844. The purity of his character, the nobility of his words, aroused great enthusiasm. He was, however, subjected to great hostility by the authorities, who secured his arrest and imprisonment, and he was finally executed in 1850. But the movement went on, and the writings of the Mb, which had been copious, were widely read. The movement has been brought into India, Europe, and the United States. It does not seek to create a new sect, but to inspire all sects with a deep fundamental love. The late Dr. Jowett once said to him that he had been so deeply impressed with the teachings and character of the E&b that he thought B~biism, as the

 of Religions. Excerpts from Chapter X: Bahd'iism — The Religion of Reconciliation. (The Lindsey Press, London, England.)  —  The Baha'i religion has made its way because it meets the needs of its day. It fits the larger outlook of our time better than the rigid exclusive older faiths. 

 A characteristic  is its unexpected liberality and toleration.  It accepts all the great religions as true, and their scriptures as inspired. The IlaM'iists bid the followers of these faiths disentangle from the windings of racial, par-ticularist,  local prejudice, the vital, immortal  thread, the pure gospel of eternal worth, and to apply this essential element of life. Instances are quoted of people being recommended  to work within the older faiths, to remain, vitalizing them upon the principles of the new faith. 

 They cannot fear new facts, new truths as the Creed-defenders must. 

 They believe in a progressive revelation.  They admit the cogency of modern criticism and allow that God is in His nature  incomprehensible, but is to be known through 

His Manifestations. Their  

 ethical ideal is very high and is of the type we Westerners  have learnt to designate "Christlike." CCWht does he do to his enemies that he makes them his friends?" was asked con —  cerning the late leader. What astonishes the student is not anything in the ethics or philosophy of this movement, but the extraordinary  response its ideal has awakened in such numbers of people, the powerful influence this standard actually exerts on conduct.  It is due to four things: (1) It makes a call on the Heroic Element in man. It offers no bribe. 

 It bids men endure3 give up, carry the cross. It calls them to sacrifice, to bear torture, to suffer martyrdom, to brave death. 

 (2) It offers liberty of thought. Even upon such a vital question as immortality it will not bind opinion., 

 its atmosphere is one of trust and hope, not of dogmatic chill. (3) It is a religion of love. teNotwitlistanding the interminable cata logue of extreme and almost incredible sufferings and privations which this heroic band of men and women have endured —  more terrible than many martyrdoms — there is not a trace of resentment or bitterness to be observed among them. One would suppose  that they were the most fortunate of the people among whom they live, as indeed they do certainly consider themselves, in that they have been permitted to live near their beloved Lord, beside which they count their sufferings as nothing" (Phelps). 

 Love for the Master, love for the brethren, love for the neighbors, love for the alien, love for all humanity, love for all life, love for God — the old, well-tried way trod once before in Syria, trodden again. (4) It is a religion in harmony with science. It has here the advantage of being thirteen centuries later than IsUm. This new dispensation has been tried in the furnace, and has not been found wanting. 

 It has been proved valid by the lives of those who have endured all things on its behalf. Here is something more appealing  than its logic and rational philosophy. 

 ttTo the Western observer" (writes. Prof. Browne), "it is the complete sincerity of the B~bis, their fearless disregard of death and torture undergone for the sake of their religion, their certain conviction as to the truth of their faith, their generally admIrable conduct toward mankind, especially toward their fellow-believers, which constitute their strongest claim on his attention." 

 "By their fruits shall ye know them!" We cannot but address to this youthful religion an All Hail! of welcome. We cannot fail to see in its activity another proof of the living witness in our own day of the working of the sleepless spirit of God in the hearts of men, for He cannot rest, by the necessity of His nature, until He hath made in conscious reality, as in power, the whole world His own.

 The dominant impression that survives in my memory of 'Abdu'l-Baha is that of an extraordinary nobility: physically, in the head so massive yet so finely poised, and the modeling of the features; but spiritually,

  in the serenity of expression, and the suggestion  of grave and responsible meditation in the deeper lines of the face. But there was also, in his complexion, carriage, and expression, an assurance of the complete health which is a requisite of a sane judgment.  And when, as in a lighter mood, his features relaxed into the playful, the assurance  was added of a sense of humor without which there is no true sense of proportion. 

 I have never met any one concerned with the philosophies of life whose judgment might seem so reliable in matters of practical conduct. 

 My regret is that my meetings with him were so few and that I could not benefit by a lengthier contact with a personality combining a dignity so impressive with human traits so engaging. 

 I wish that he could be multiplied I 

B~ LEO TOLSTOY             

  Translated from a letter to Mine. Isabel Grincvskaya, Oct. 22, 1903. 

 I am very glad that Mr. V. V. Stassov has told you of the good impression which your book has made on me, and I thank you for sending it. I have known about the Bab's for a long time, and have always been interested in their teachings. 

 It seems to me that these teachings, as well as all the rationalistic social  religious teachings that have arisen lately out of the original teachings of Brahmanism, Buddhism, 

Judaism, Christianity      

 and IsUm distorted by the priests, have a great future for this very reason that these teachings, discarding  all these distorting incrustations that cause division, aspire to unite into one common religion of all mankind. 

 Therefore, the teachings of the BThis, inasmuch as they have rejected the old Mu-bammadan  superstitions and have not established new snperstitions which would divide them from other new superstitions (unfor-tunately  something of the kind is noticed in the exposition of the Teachings 0± the Bab), and inasmuch as they keep to the principal fundamental ideas of brotherhood, equality and love, have a great future before them. 

 In the Mubammadan religion there has been lately going on an intensive spiritual movement. I know that one such movement  is centered in the French colonies in Africa, and has its name (I do not remember  it), and its prophet. Another movement exists in India, Lahore, and also has its prophet and publishes its paper 

Review of Religions.       

 Both these religious teachings contain nothing new, neither do they have for their principal object a changing of the outlook of the people and thus do not change the relationship  between the people, as is the case with Bibjism, though not so much in its theory (Teachings of the Mb) as in the practice of life as far as I know it. I therefore  sympathize with Bibjism with all my heart inasmuch as it teaches people brotherhood and equality and sacrifice of material life for service to God. 

  Translated from a letter to Frid ul Khan Wadelbekow. 

 (This communication is dated 1908 and is found among epistles written to Caucasian  Muhammadans.) 

  In answer to your, letter which questions  how one should understand the term God. I send you a collection of writings from my literary and reading club, in which some thoughts upon the nature of God are included. In my opinion if we were to free ourselves from all false conceptions of God we should, whether as Christians or Muhammadans, free ourselves entirely from piaur-ing  God as a personality. The conception which then seems to me to be the best for meeting the requirements of reason and heart is found in 4th chap. St. John, 71215 that means God is Love. 

 It therefore follows that God lives in us according to the measure  or capacity of each soul to express His nature. This thought is implicit more or less clearly in all religions, and therefore in Muhammadanism. 

 Concerning your second question upon what awaits us after doath I can oniy reply that on dying we return to God from whose Life we came. God, however, being Love we can on going over expect God only. 

 Concerning your third question, I answer that so far as I understand Ts1~im, like all other religions, Brahmanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, etc., it contains great basic

  truths but that these have become corrupted by superstition, and coarse interpretations and filled with unnecessary legendic descriptions. 

 I have had much help in my researches to get clear upon Mu#ammadan-by a splendid little book "The Sayings of 

Muhammad."                 

 The teachings of the Bab's which come to us out of IsUm have through Baha'u'llah's teachings been gradually developed and now present us with the highest and purest form of religious teaching. 
                           
   B~ DR. EDMUND PRIVAT       

  The practical and spiritual understanding between nations, the realization of the unity of mankind above all barriers of language and religion, the feeling of responsibility towards all who suffer from grief or injustice  are oniy different branches of the same central teaching which gives the Baha'i Movement such a faithful and active family of workers in so many countries.

  ously to the Illumined Path of the Great Revelation. 

  B~ REV. FREDERICK W. OAKES The Enlightener of human minds in respect  to their religious foundations and priv'ileges  is of such vital importance that no one is safe who does not stop and listen for its quiet meaning, and is to the mind of men, as the cooling breeze that unseen passes its breath over the varying leaves of a tree. Watch it! And see how uniformly, like an unseen hand passing caressingly over all its leaves: Full of tender care and even in its gifts of love and greater life: Caresses each leaf. Such it is to one who has seated himself amid the flowers and fruit trees in the Garden Beautiful at 'Akka, just within the circle of that Holy and Blessed shrine where rests the Mortal part of the 

Great Enlightener.  His   

 handiwork is there, you touch the fruit and flowers his hand gave new life's hopes to, and kneeling as I did beside Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Marvelous Manifestation,  felt the spirit's immortal love of Him who rests there. 

 While I could not speak the words of the Litany, my soui knew the wondrous meaning, for every word was a word of the soul's language that speaks of the Eternal love and care of the Eternal Father. 

 So softly and so living were the reflections from his beautiful personality, that one needed not spoken words to be interpreted. 

 And this Pilgrim came away renewed  and refreshed to such a degree, that the hard bands of formalism were replaced by the freedom of love and light that will ever make that sojourn there the prize memory and the Door of revelation never to be closed again, and never becloud the glorious Truth of Universal Brotherhood. A calm, and glorious influence that claims the heart and whispers to each of the pulsing leaves of the great family in all experiences of life, "Be not afraid. It is I!" — And makes us long to help all the world to know the meaning  of those words spoken by 

The Great Revealer, "Let   

 us strive with heart and soul that unity may dwell in the world." And to catch the greatness of the word "Strive," in quietness and reflection. 

 B~ RENWICK J. G. MILLAR Editor of Jo/on    O'Groat Journal, Wick, Scotland I was in Chicago for only some ten days, yet it would take a hundred chapters to describe all the splendid sights and institutions I was privileged to see. 

 No doubt Chicago  has more than its fair share of alien gangsters and gunmen, and the despicable doings of this obnoxious class has badly vitiated its civic life and reputation. 

 But for all that it is a magnificent city — in many respects probably the finest in America; a city of which its residents have innumerable reasons to be proud.... 

 Every day indeed was filled up with sightseeing  and the enjoyment of lavish hospitality.  One day, for example, I was entertained to lunch at the Illinois Athletic Club as the guest of Mr. Robert Black, a prosperous  Scot belonging to Wigtonshire, who is in the building trade. 

 He is an ex-presi-dent of the St. Andrew's Society. 

 Mr. Falconer  and other Scots' friends were present, and they were all exceedingly kind and complimentary. 

 I could not, in short, have been treated with more distinction if I had been a prominent Minister of State instead of a humble Scottish journalist out on a mission of fraternity and good will. 

 On the same day I met by appointment Mr. Albert R. Windust with whom I went out to see the Baha'i Temple which is in course of being erected at Wilmette, a suburb of Chicago on the shore of Lake Michigan. 

 It is about an hour's ride out on the elevated railway. Only the foundation and basement have so far been constructed, and the work was meanwhile stopped, but, we understand, is now shortly to be resumed. 

 I have no hesitation in saying that when completed this Temple will be one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture in the world. I had the privilege of an introduction  to the architect, a Frenchman, M. Bourgeois, who speaks English fluently. We spent a considerable time with him in his beautiful studio overlooking the Lake, and he did me the honour of showing me the plans of the Temple, drawings which cost him years of toil, and they are far beyond anything I could have imagined in beauty

  and spiritual significance. 

 M. Bourgeois, who is well advanced in years, is a genius and mystic — a gentleman of charming personality. 

 In all that I had the pleasure of seeing in his studio I had a privilege that is given to few. 

 My signature is in his personal  book, which contains the names of some of the great ones of the earth! Mr. Windust, who is a leading Baha'i in the city, is a quiet and humble man, but full of fine ideas and ideals. 

 He treated me with the utmost brotherly courtesy. How is it, I kept asking myself, that it should be mine to have all this privilege and honour? There was no reason save that they told inc I had touched the chords of truth and sincerity in referring to and reviewing the Baha'i writings and principles in a few short articles in this Journal. The Temple is designed to represent these principles — universal religion, urn-versal  brotherhood, universal education, and the union of science and religion. Meantime the Chicagoans are seemingly indifferent to all its spiritual significance; but some day they will wake up to a realisation of the fact that its symbolism will mark the city as one of destiny in the world.

  Humanity is the better, the nobler, for the Baha'i 

Faith. It is a Faith      

 that enriches the soul; that takes from life its dross. 

 I am prompted thus to express myself because of what I have seen, what I have heard, what I have read of the results of the Movement  founded by the Reverend Baha'u'llah. Embodied within that Movement is the spirit of world brotherhood; that brotherhood that makes for unity of thought and action. 

 Though not a member of the Baha'i Faith, I sense its tremendous potency for good. Ever is it helping to usher in the dawn of the day of "Peace on 

Earth Good Will to Men."  

 By the spread of its teachings, the Baha'i cause is slowly, yet steadily, making the Golden Rule a practical reality. 

 With the high idealism of Baha'u'llah as its guide, the Baha'i Faith is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. Countless are its good works. For example, to the pressing economic prob lems it gives a new interpretation, a new solution. But above all else it is causing peoples everywhere to realize they are as one, by heart and spirit divinely united. 

 And so I find joy in paying this little tribute to a cause that is adding to the sweetness,  the happiness, the cleanness of life. 

  B~ PROF. HART PRASAD SYIASTRI, D.Lirr. 

  My contact with the Baha'i Movement and my acquaintance with its teachings, given by Ijadrat-i-Bah6'u'lHh, have filled me with real joy, as I see that this Movement, so cosmopolitan in its appeal, and so spiritual in its advocacy of Truth, is sure to bring peace and joy to the hearts of millions. 

 Free from metaphysical subtleties, practical in its outlook, above all sectarianism, and based on God, the substratum of the human soul and the phenomenal world, the Baha'i Movement carries peace and illumination with it. As long as it is kept free from orthodoxy and church-spirit, and above personalities, it will continue to be a blessing to its followers. 
                          
B~ Sum PUROHIT SWAMI      

  I am in entire sympathy with all of the principles that the Baha'i Movement stands for; there is nothing which is contrary to what I am preaching. I think at this stage of the world such teachings are needed more than anything else. 

 I find the keynote of the Teachings is the spiritual regeneration of the world. 

 The world is getting more and more spiritually bankrupt every day, and if it requires anything it requires spiritual life. The Baha'i Movement stands above all caste, creed and color and is based on pure spiritual unity.

            1.                        

 The central drive of the Baha'i Movement  is for human unity. It would secure this through unprejudiced search for truth, making religion conform to scientific discovery  and insisting that fundamentally all religions are alike. For the coming of i.ini

  versal peace, there is great foresight and wisdom as to details. Among other things there should be a universal language; so the Baha'is take a great interest in Esperanto though they do not insist on it as the ultimate language. 

 No other religious movement has put so much emphasis on the emancipation and education of women. Everyone should work whether rich or poor and poverty should be abolished. What will be the course of the Baha'i Movement no one can prophesy, but I think it is no exaggeration to claim that the program is the finest fruit of the religious contribution of Asia. 

  Shoghi Effendi's statement cannot be improved upon. 

 The Baha'is have had the soundest position on the race question of any religion. They not oniy accept the scientific conclusions but they also implement them with spiritual force. 

 This latter is necessary because there is no other way to overcome the emotional element which is basic in the race problem. 

 ~     have not said enough perhaps in the first paragraph. 

 Please add the following: The task of learning to live together, though different, is the most difficult and the most imperative that the world faces. 

 The economic  problem will be relatively easy in comparison.  There are differences in the qualities of cultures but there are no differences in qualities of races that correspond. This being  recognized by minorities leads them to resist methods of force to keep them in subordination. There is no solution except co5peration and the granting of self-respect." 

  B~ VISCOUNT HERBERT SAMUEL, G.C.B., M.P. In John O'London's Weekly, March 25th, 1933. 

  It is possible indeed to pick out points of fundamental agreement among all creeds. That is the essential purpose of the Baha'i Religion, the foundation and growth of which is one of the most striking movements that have proceeded from the East in recent generations. 
            2.                        

 If one were compelled to choose which of the many religious communities of the world was closest to the aim and purpose of this Congress, I think one would be obliged to say that it was the comparatively little known 

Baha'i Community. Other    

 faiths and creeds have to consider, at a Congress like this, in what way they can contribute to the idea of world fellowship. 

 But the Baha'i Faith exists almost for the sole purpose of contributing to the fellowship and the unity of mankind. 

 Other communities may consider how far a particular element of their respective faith may be regarded as similar to those of other communities, but the Baha'i Faith exists for the purpose of combining in one synthesis all those elements in the various faiths which are held in common. And that is why I suggest that this Baha'i community is really more in agreement with the main idea which has led to the summoning of the Congress than any particular one of the great religious communities of the world. 

 Its origin was in Persia where a mystic prophet, who took the name of the Bab, the "Gate," began a mission among the Persians in the earlier part of the nineteenth century. He collected a considerable number of adherents. 

 His activities were regarded with apprehension by the Government of Persia of that day. Finally, be and his leading disciples were seized by the forces of the Persian Government and were shot in tbe year 1850. In spite of the persecution, the movement spread in Persia and in many countries of Isl4m. He was followed as the head of the Community by the one who has been its principal prophet and exponent, Baha'u'llah. He was most active and despite persecution and imprisonment made it his life's mission to spread the creed which he claimed to have received by direct divine revelation. He died in 1892 and was succeeded as the head of the Community by his son, 'Abdu'l-Baha,  who was born in 1844. He was liVing in Haifa, in a simple house, when I went there as High Commissioner in 1920, and I had the privilege of one or two most interesting  conversations with him on the principles and methods of the Baha'i 

Faith. He


<p498>

  died in 1921 and his obsequies were attended by a great concourse of people. 

 I had the honour of representing His Majesty the King on that occasion. 

 Since that time, the Baha'i Faith has secured  the support of a very large number of communities throughout the world. 

 At the present time it is estimated that there are about eight hundred Ba1A'i communities in various countries. In the United States, near Chicago, a great Temple, now approaching completion, has been erected by American adherents of the Faith, with assistance from elsewhere. Shoghi Effendi, the grandson of 'Abdu'l-Baha, is now the head of the community. 

 He caine to England and was educated  at Balliol College, Oxford, but now lives in Haifa, and is the center of a community which has spread throughout the world.

  B~  LORD SAMUEL OF CARMEL, G.C.B.,C.B.E. In 1920 II was appointed as the first High 

Commissioner for Palestine 

 under the British Mandate, and took an early opportunity of paying a visit to 'Abdu'l-Baha Effendi at His home in 

Haifa.                     

 I had for some time been interested in the Baha'i movement, and felt privileged by the opportunity of making the acquaintance of its Head. I had also an official reason as well as a personal one. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha had been persecuted by the Turks. 

 A British r~gime had now been substituted in Palestine for the Turkish. Toleration and respect for all religions had long been a principle of British rule wherever it extended; and the visit of the High Commissioner was intended to be a sign to the population that the adherents of every creed would be able to feel henceforth that they enjoyed the respect  and could count upon the goodwill of the new Government of the land. 

 I was impressed, as was every visitor, by 'Abdu'l-Baha's dignity, grace and charm. 

 Of moderate stature, His strong features and lofty expression lent to His personality an appearance of majesty. In our conversation He readily explained and discussed the principal tenets of Baha'i, answered my inquiries and listened to my comments. 

 I remember vividly that friendly interview of sixteen years ago, in the simple room of the villa, surrounded by gardens, on the sunny hillside of 

Mount Carmel.              

 I was glad I had paid my visit so soon, for in 1921 'Abdu'l-Baha died. 

 I was only able to express my respect for His creed and my regard for His person by coming from the capital to attend His funeral. A great throng had gathered together, sorrowing for His death, but rejoicing also for His life.

 Last summer upon my return from a visit to Japan, I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehier on the boat. It was learnt that this lady is a teacher of the Baha'i Cause, so we conversed upon various subjects of human life very thoroughly. It was soon found that what the lady imparted to me came from the source of Truth as I have felt inwardly all along, so I at once realized that the Baha'i Faith can offer numerous and profound benefits to mankind. 

 My senior, Mr. Y. S. Tsao, is a well-read man. His mental capacity and deep experience  are far above the average man. He often said that during this period of our country when old beliefs have lost their hold upon the people, it is absolutely necessary to seek a religion of all-embracing Truth which may exert its powerful influence in saving the situation. For the last ten years, he has investigated indefatigably into the teachings  of the Baha'i Cause. Recently, he has completed his translations of the book on the New Era and showed me a copy of the proof. 

 After carefully reading it, I came to the full realization that the Truth as imparted  to me by Mrs. Ransom-Keller is veritable and unshakeable. 

 This Truth of great value to mankind has been eminently translated by Mr. Tsao and now the Chinese people have the opportunity of reading it, and I cannot but express my profound appreciation for the same. Should the Truth of the Baha'i Faith be widely disseminated among the Chinese people, it will naturally lead to the coming of the Kingdom of

  B~ REV. GRIFFITH J. SPARHAM 

    Higligate Hill Unitarian   
Christian Church, London,  

England                    

 In his book A League of Religicms, the Rev. J. Tyssul Davis, formerly minister of the Theistic Church in London, and at present minister of a Unitarian Church in Bristol, England, the writer sets out to demonstrate  that each great religious movement in the world has contributed something of peculiar importance to the spiritual life of man. Thus, he says, the great contribu-don of Zoroastrianism has been the thought of Purity; of Bralimanism that of 

Justice; of Muhammadanism  

 that of Submission; of Christianity that of Service; and so on. In each instance he lays his finger on the one thing ~ar excellence for which the particular religious culture seemed to him to stand, and tries to catch its special contribution in an epigrammatic phrase. 

 Coming, in this way, to BaM'iism, he names it "the Religion of Reconciliation." 

 In his chapter on Bah&'iism he says: ctThe Baha'i religion has made its way because  it meets the need of the day. It fits the larger outlook of our time, better than the rigid older faiths. 

 A characteristic is its unexpected liberality and toleration. 

 It accepts  all the great religions as true and their scriptures as inspired." 

 These, then, as he sees BahA'iism, are its essential features: liberality, toleration, the spirit of reconciliation; and that, not in the sense, as Mr. H. G. Wells has it in his Soul of a Bishop, of making a "collection" of approved portions of the world's varied and differing creeds, but in the sense, as he also


<p500>
500             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  puts it in the same book, of achieving a great 'tsimplification." 

 ttBahA'iists," says Dr. Davis, Czbid the followers of these (that is, the world's) faiths disentangle from the windings of racial, par-ticularist, local prejudices, the vital, immortal  thread of the pure gospel of eternal worth, and to apply this essential element to life." 

 That is Dr. Davis's interpretation of the genius of Bah?iism, and that it is a true one, no one who has studied Bahi'iism, even superficially, can question, least of all the outsider. Indeed one may go further and assert  that no one who has studied Bah~i'iism, whether superficially or otherwise, would wish to question it; particularly if he approaches  the subject from a liberal and unprejudiced point of view. In the last act of his Wandering Jew, Mr. Temple Thurston puts into the mouth of Matteos, the Wandering  Jew himself, the splendid line, 'tAll men are Christians — all are Jews." He might equally well have written, (CAll men are Christians — all are Baha'is." For, if the sense of the Unity of Truth is a predominant characteristic of liberally-minded people, whatever may be their religious tradition, it is predominantly a characteristic of Bah&'i-mm; since here is a religious system based, fundamentally, on the one, simple, profound, comprehensive doctrine of the unity of God, which carries with it, as its necessary corollary  and consequence, the parallel doctrine of the unity of Man. 

 This, at all events, is the conviction of the present writer; and it is why, as a Unitarian, building his own faith on the same basic principles of divine and human unity, he has long felt sympathy with and good will toward a religious culture which stands on a foundation identical with that of the faith he holds. And a religion that affirms the unity of things must of necessity be a religion of reconciliation; the truth of which in the case of Bah&'iism is clear.

 Br HON. LILIAN HELEN MONTAGUE, J.P., DEL. 

  As a Jewess I am interested in the Baha'i Community. 

 The teaching lays particular stress on the Unity of God and the Unity of Man, and incorporates the doctrine of the Hebrew Prophets that the Unity of God is revealed in the Unity of Men. Also, we seem to share the conception of God's messengers  as being those people who in their deep reverence for the attributes of God, His beauty, His truth, His righteousness and His justice, seek to imitate Him in their imperfect human way. The light of God is reflected  in the soui of him who seeks to be receptive. Like the members of the Baha community, we Jews are scattered all over the world, but united in a spiritual brotherhood.  The Peace ideal enumerated by the Hebrew Prophets is founded on faith in the ultimate triumph of God's justice and righteousness.

  (From efPalestine,~~ by Norman B~ntwich, p. 235.) 

 "Palestine may indeed be now regarded as the land not of three but of four faiths, because the Baha'i creed, which has its center of faith and pilgrimage in Acre and Haifa, is attaining to the character of a world-re-ligion.  So far as its influence goes in the land, it is a factor making for international and inter-religious understanding."

  des solutions qui coincident curieusement avec les pr6occupations de notre 6poque. 

 Cette religion, de plus, est par essence antiraciste. 

 Elle est n6e en Perse, vers 1840, et les trois proph&tes successifs qui Pont pr&h6e sont des Persans, c'est-&-dire des musulmans de naissance. 

 Le premier, le cr6ateur, s'appelait le Bab. Ii pr&ha vers 1850, et pr6conisa, outre la r&onciliation des difT4rents cultes qui divi-sent  1'humanit6, Ia lib6ration de La femme, r~duite aujourd'hui encore un quasi escia-vage  dans tout 1'Islam. 

 Une Persane d'une rare beaut6, et qui, chose rare chez les musulmanes, 6tait dou6e d'un grand talent oratpire, r6pondant au nom diflicile ~i prononcer de Qourratou-'l-'Am,  1'accompagna dans ses r6unions, n'h6si-tant pas, en donnant elIe-m&me 1'exemple, ~ pr6coniser la suppression du voile pour les femmes. 

 Le BTh et elle r6ussirent ~ convaincre, ~i 1'~poque, des dizaines de milliers de Persans et le shah de Perse les emprisonna 1'un a 1'autre, ainsi que la plupart de leurs partisans. Le BTh fut pendu. Sa belle collaboratrice fut ~trang16e dans sa prison. 

 Leurs disciples furent exilAs ~ Saint-Jean-d'Acre, devenue temple du "BahA'iisme." 

 C'est ainsi que j'ai visit6 Ia maison du successeur du Mb, Baha'u'llah,  transform6e aujourd'hui en temple du tcBhA~iisme~~ Vest ainsi que s'intitule cette religion, qui est plutOt une doctrine philosophique, car elle ne comporte ni culte d6fini, ni surtout de clerg~. Les pr&res, disent les BaM'istes, sont tent6s de fausser, dans un but de lucre, 1'id~a1isme d&int6ress5 des cr6ateurs de religions. 

 Baha'u'llah, Ic principal des trois pro-phates, r6pandit sa doctrine non seulement en Orient, mais dans beaucoup de pays d'Eu-rope,  et surtout aux Etats-Unis oii son influence  fut telle que le nombre des Bahi'i-istes attient aujourd'hui plusicurs millions. II fut pers6cut6 par les Perses a mourut en exile. 

 Son fils, 'Abdu'l-Baha, lui succ6da a formula, d'apr&s les principes de son p&e, Ia doctrine 6conomique du Bah?iisme; elle indique une prescience 6tonnante des 6v~nements qui se sont d&oul6s depuis: Ia guerre d'abord, Ia crise ensuite. Ii mourut peu apr~s la guerre, ayant vu la r~aIisation de La premkre partie de ses pro-ph6ties. 

 L'originalit6 du Bah&iisme est de chercher a faire passer dans le domaine pratique, et plus particuli&ement dans le domaine social, les principes essentiels du judaYsme, du ca-tholicisme a de 1'islamisme, en les combi-nant  et en les adaptant aux besoins de forte epoque. 

 La Bah~i'iisme proclame que les rapports sociaux deviennent fatalement impossibles dans une soci6t6 oii 1'id6alisme individuel ne donne pas une base certaine aux engagements qui lient les hommes entre eux. 

 L'individu se sent de plus en plus isol6 au mileau d'une jungle sociale qui menace, ~ beaucoup d'6gards, son bien-etre a sa se-curit6.  La bonne volontd et 1'honnetet6, ne produisant plus dans sa vie et dans son travail le r6sultat qu'il attend, tendent ~ perdre pour lui toute valeur pratique. 

 De Ii nais-sent,  scion les caractres, 1'indiff6rence et le d&ouragement, ou 1'audace, le manque de scrupules qui tendent ~ se procurer par tous les moyens, mdme les plus r~pr6-hensibles, les b~n6fices mat6riels n&essaires ~ 1'existence. 

 La soci~t~, n'6tant plus soumise ~ aucun contrOle, ni politique ni moral, devient ian vaisseau sans gouvernail ofl personne ne peut plus rien pr6voir a qui est sujet ~i des crises de plus en pius fr6quentes et de plus en plus violentes. L'6poque actuelle, d6clarent les proph&es persans, marque la fin d'une chili-sation  qui ne sen plus les int6r~ts de 1'hu-. manit6. 

 File aboutit ~ la faillite cornpkte des institutions morales et mat6rielles destin6es ~ assurer ie bien-etre et la s6curit6 des hommes, c'est-~-dire 1'ttat, 1'~g1ise, le Commerce et 1'Industrie. 

 Le principe fondamental d'oh peut venir le saint de Ia civilisation engag& dans des voics qui conduisent ~i sa destruction est la solidarit6 des nations a des races. Car 1'interp6n&ration des peuples est devenue telle qu'iI leur est impossible de trouver isol6-ment la voic de Ia prosp6rit6. 

 Ces proph6ties, qui pouvaient paraitre cx-cessives  Ct quelque peu pessimistes ~ 1'~poque oii elles ont &~ faites, vers 1890, ne sont pas, les ~v~nements 1'ont prouv6, de simples j6r~miades.

  exactes, le IBah~'iisme, con~u dans la Perse lointaine et si arn6r6e ~ 1'~poque, aboutit aux m&mcs conclusions que la plupart des 6conomistes modernes qui, dans Ics diff6rents pays de civilisation occidentale, proclament qu'en dehors d'une collaboration interna-tionale  ii Wy a pas d'issue possible ~ Ia crise actuelle entrainant tous les peuples ~ une mis&e toujours plus grande. 

  Une religion rCdconomique~~ (From Les Achos, Paris, France, September 28, 1933.) 

  Les principes du Bahi'iisme, formul6s par son principal proph&e, Baha'u'llah, peuvent paraitre s6rieusement compromis en un temps oii la fr6n6sie nationaliste, r6cemment aggrav6e de racisme, semble en dloigner de plus en pius 1'application. 

 Toute Ia question est de savoir si ceux qui sont en faveur aujourd'hui, dans tant de pays, sont susceptibles de r6soudre le pro-bkme  non pas de la prosp4rit6, mais simple-ment du logement et de la f aim, dans les diff&~ntes nations qui nient par leurs th6o-ries  et tous leurs actes a solidarit6 des peuples a des races. 

 Une nouvelle guerre mondiale sera sans doute n6cessaire pour que 1'humanit~, qui n'a pas encore compris la leqon de 1914, se rende enfin compte que les solutions de violence et de conquete ne peuvent engendrer que la ruine g6n6rale, sans profit pour aucun des bellig6rants. 

 Quoi qu'il en soit, les principales pens6es 6conomiques de Baha'u'llah, telles qu'clles ant 6t6 formul6es ii y a un demisi&le, prou-vent  que Ia sagesse a Ic simple hon sens ont cela de commun avec les 6crevisses, c'esr qu'il Lair arrive fr6quemtnent de marcher ~ reculons. 

 Voici les principaux pr6ceptes de cc rnoderne Marc-Aurele: t~L'dvo1ution humaine se divise en cycles orgauiques, correspondant ~ la dur& d'une religion, laquelle est d'environ un millier d'ann6es. 

 Un cycle social nouveau commence  toutes les fois qu'apparait un proph&e dont 1'influence et les enseignements renou —  vellent la vie int&ieure de 1'homme a font dderler ~ travers le monde une nouvelle vague de progr~s. 

 "Chaque nouveau cycie d6truit les croy-ances et les institutions us&s du cycle pr&~-dent  et fonde sur d'autres croyances, en 6troite conformit~, celles-h, avec les besoins actuels cle 1'humanit6, une civilisation nou-velle. 

 "L'iniluence de chaque proph~te s'est, dans le passe, hmit6e i tine race ou une religion, en raison de I'isolement g6ographique des r~gions et des races, maTh le si6cle dans lequel nous entrons n~cessite Ia cr6ation d'un ordre organique s'&endant an monde entier. 

 Si le vicil esprit de tribu persiste, Ia science de-truira  le monde, ses forces destructrices ne pouvant etre contr6l&s que par une hu-manit6 unie travaillant pour Ia prosp6rit6 et le bien commun. 

 "La loi de Ia lutte pour la vie n'existe plus pour 1'homme d&s qu'il devient conscient de ses pouvoirs spirituels a moraux. 

 Elle est alors rempIac~e par Ia loi plus haute de Ia coop6ration. Sous cette Ioi, 1'individu jouira d'un statut beaucoup pius large que celui qui est accord~ aux citoyens passifs du corps politique actuel. L'administration publique passera des mains de partisans politiques qui trahissent la cause du peuple aux mains d'hommes capables de consid6rer une charge publique comme une mission sacree. 

 (cLa stabilit6 &onomique ne d6pcnd pas de 1'application de tel plan socialiste ou communiste plus ou moms th~orique, mais du sentiment de Ia solidarid morale qui unit tous les bommes et de cette conception que 'Cs richesses ne sont pas la fin de Ia vie, mais statement un moyen de vivre. 

 "L'important n'est pas en une aveugic soumission g~n6rale ~ tel syst~me politique, ~i tel r~glement, qui ont pour effet de sup-primer  chez 1'indiviclu tout sentiment cJe responsabilit6 morale, mais en un esprit d'entr'aide et de coop6ration. Ni le principe d~mocratique, ni le principe aristocratiquc ne peuvent fournir s6par~rnent ~ Ia soci6td une base solide. La democratie est impuis-sante  contre les querelles intestines et 1'aris-tocratie  ne subsiste que par Ia guerre. 

 IJne combinaison des deux principes est donc n&essaire.

  de la coop&ation, la vie m~me de 1'huma-nit6  est en p6ril. Les ambitions nationalistes, la lutte des classes, Ia peur et le convoitises 6conomiques sont autant de forces qui pous-sent  ~t une nouvelle guerre internationale. Tous les Gouvernements du monde doivent soutenir et organiser une assembl6e dont les membres sojent 6lus par 1'dite des nations. Ceux-ci devront mettre au point, au.-dessus des ~goYsmes particuliers, le noveau statut &onomique du monde en dehors duquel tous Les pays, maTh surtout 1'Europe, seront conduits  aux pires catastrophes." 

 'Abdu'l-Baha, son successeur, reprenant la doctrine de son pare, concluait dans un dis-cours  prononc6 ?~ New-York en 1912: "La civilisation mat6rielle a atteint, en Occident, le plus haut degr6 de son d~ve1op-pement.  Mais c'est en Orient qu'a pris nais-sance  et que s 'est d6velopp6e Ia civilisation spirituelle. 

 Un lien s'6tablira entre ces deux forces, et leur union est la condition de 1'immense progr&s qui doit ~tre accompli. 

 "Hors de h, la s6curit~ et la contiance feront de plus en pius d6faut, les luttes et les dissensions s'accroitront de jour en jour a les divergences entre nations s'accentue-ront davantage. Les pays augmenteront constamment lears armements; la guerre, puis Ia certitude d'une autre guerre mondiale angoisseront de plus en plus les esprits. L'unit~ du genre humain est le premier f on-dement  de toutes les vertus." 

 Ainsi park 'Abdu'l-Baha en 1912, et tout se passa comme ii 1'avait pr~dit. 

 Mais ces paroles n'ont pas vicilli; dies pourraient, sans le moindre changement, ~tre r6p6t6es en 1933. Aujourd'hui, comme ii y a vingt ans, la menace de Ia guerre est de nouveau suspendue an-dessus de nos tetes et les causes de haines a de conflits s'accu-mulent & tel point que, ski existe vraiment un flux et un reflux des id&s, on peut presque conclure, avec une certaine dose d'optimisme, pie nous n'avons jamais 6t~ si pr~s de venir aux id6es de coop6ration qui, seules, peuvent nous sauver.

 The philosophy of Baha'u'llah deserves the best thought we can give it. I am returning  the book so that other blind people who have more leisure than myself may be "shown a ray of Divinity" and their hearts be "bathed in an inundation of eternal love." 

 I take this opportunity to thank you for your kind thought of me, and for the inspiration  which even the most cursory reading  of Baha'u'llah's life cannot fail to impart. 

 What nobler theme than the "good of the world and the happiness of the nations"  can occupy our lives? The message of universal peace will surely prevail. It is useless to combine or conspire against an idea which has in it potency to create a new earth and a new heaven and to quicken human beings with a holy passion of service.

 "The morals of humanity must undergo change. New remedy and solution for human  problems must be adopted. Human intellects themselves must change and be subject to the universal reformation." In these three sentences we really have it all.

Without unity no man can live in happiness." Princess though she is, she stressed the important  truth that every man must do his job!

  (Excerpt from a letter dated January 26, 1935.) 

 I have read the pamphlet on the New World Order by Shoghi Effendi. It is an eloquent expression of the doctrines which I have always associated with the Baha'i Movement and I would like to express my great sympathy with the aspirations towards world unity which underlie his teaching. 

  B~ PROF. DR. V. LESNY 1. 

 The conditions are so changed now, since the technique of the present time has destroyed  the barriers between nations, that the world needs a uniting force, a kind of super-religion. I think Bah&'iism could de-veiop to such a kind of religion. 

 I am quite convinced of it, so far as I know the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. 

 There are modern saviors and Baha'u'llah is a Savior of the twentieth century. Everything must be done on a democratic basis, there must be international brotherhood. We must learn to have confidence in ourselves and then in others. One way to learn this is through inner spiritual education, and a way to attain such an education may be through 

Bahi'iism.                 

  I am still of the opinion that I had four years ago that the Baha'i Movement can form the best basis for international goodwill,  and that Baha'u'llah Himself is the Creator of an eternal bond between the East and the West. 

 The Baha'i Teaching is a living religion, a living philosophy. 

 I do not blame Christianity, it has done a good work for culture in Europe, but there are too many dogmas in Christianity at the present time. Buddhism was very good for India from the sixth century B.C. and the Teachings of Christ have been good for the whole world; but as there is a progress of mind there must be no stopping  and in the Baha'i Faith one sees the continued progress of religion.

  The Baha'i Teaching carries in its Message  a fine optimism — we must always in spite of everything be optimists; we must be optimists even when events seem to prove the contrary! 

 And Baha'is can be hopeful, for there is a power in these Teachings to bring to humanity tranquillity, peace and a higher spirituality.

  'While sectarians squabble over creeds, the Baha'i Movement goes on apace. 

 It is growing  by leaps and bounds. It is hope and progress. It is a world movement — and it is destined to spread its effulgent rays of enlightenment  throughout the earth until every mind is free and every fear is banished.  The friends of the Baha'i Cause believe  they see the dawn of the new day — the better day — the day of Truth, of Justice, of Liberty, of Magnanimity, of Universal Peace, and of International Brotherhood, the day when one shall work for all, and all shall work for one.

  I am heartily in accord with the Baha'i Movement, in which I have been interested for several years. The religion of peace is the religion we need and always have needed, and in this Baha'i is more truly the religion of peace than any other. 
                           
  B~ Paor. YONE NOGUCHI      

  I have heard so much about 'Abdu'l-Baha, whom people call an idealist, but I should like to call Him a realist, because no idealism,  when it is strong and true, exists without  the endorsement of realism. There is nothing more real than His words on truth. His words are as simple as the sunlight; again like the sunlight, they are universal.

  One reason I hail with thanksgiving the interpretation of religion known as the Baha'i Faith and feel so deep a kinship with its followers is that I recognize in its Revelation  an outreach of the Divine to stumbling humanity; a veritable thrust from the radiant  Center of 

Life.                      

 Every follower of this faith that I have ever met impressed me as a living witness. to the glory at the heart of this universe. Each one seemed filled with a splendor of spirit so great that it overflowed all boundaries  and poured itself out upon the world here in this moment of time, by some concentrated act of 'ove toward another human  being.

  The lovely peace of Carmel, which still attracts mystics of different faiths, dominates  Haifa. On its summit are the Druses in their two villages; at its feet the German Templars, whose avenue leads up to the now large and beautiful terraced property of the Persian Baha'is on the mountainside. Here the tombs of the BM, and of 'Abdu'l-Baha, set in a fair garden, are a place of international pilgrimage. On Sundays and holidays the citizens of Haifa of all faiths come for rest and recreation where lie the bones of that young prophet of $hir4z who nearly a hundred years ago preached that all men are one and all the great religions true, and foretold  the coming equality of men and women and the birth of the first

  them a little bitter towards it. Everything else in their characters is accounted for as due to their Teachings; they are wonderfully ready to help and happy to sacrifice. Faithfully they fulfill their office and professional duties. 

 Long ago they already solved the problem of the Eastern woman; their chii-dren  are carefully educated. They are sometimes reproached for their lack of patriotism. Certainly, as specifically Persian as the Shi'ih Faith, the Baha'i Faith can never become; but the Baha'i Religion like Christianity does not preclude the love of one's fatherland.... 

 Are the Europeans not sufficiently patriotic! 

 According to my experiences, the Baha'is in that respect, are very unjustly criticized by their Mubammadan brothers. During the centuries the Shi'ih Religion has developed a deep national tradition; with this the universal Baha'i Faith will have a hard battle. Nevertheless, the lack of so great numbers is richly recompensed by the fervor and the inner spirit of the Persian Baha'i 

Community. The Baha'i     

 world community  will educate characters which will appear well worthy of emulation by people of other Faiths, yes, even by the world of those now enemies of the Baha'i 

Cause.                     

 The experience acquired in the West, for me was fully verified also in the Persian Orient. The Baha'i Faith is undoubtedly an in-unense cultural value. Could all those men whose high morality I admired and still admire have reached the same heights oniy in another way, without it? No, never I Is it based oniy on the novelty of the Teachings,  and in the freshness of its closest followers?

  I have followed it (the Baha'i Cause) with deep interest ever since my trip to London to the 

First Races Congress       

 in July, 1911, when I heard for the first time of the Baha'i Movement and its summary of the principles for peace. I followed it during the war and after the war. The Baha'i Teaching is one of the spiritual forces now absolutely necessary to put the spirit first in this battle against material forces. 

 The Baha'i Teaching is one of the great instruments for the final victory of the spirit and of humanity.

 The Baha'i Cause is one of the great moral and social forces in all the world today.  I am more convinced than ever, with the increasing moral and political crises in the world, we must have greater international coordination. Such a movement as the Baha'i Cause which paves the way for universal organization of peace is necessary.

  ing after Him and of presenting 

Him to Lord Kitchener     

 who was deeply impressed by His personality, as who could fail to be? The war separated us again until Lord Al-lenby,  after his triumphant drive through Syria, sent me to establish the Government at Haifa and throughout that district. I called upon 'Abbas Effendi on the day I arrived  and was delighted to find Him unchanged. 

 I never failed to visit Him whenever I went to Haifa. His conversation was indeed  a remarkable planning, like that of an ancient prophet, far above the perplexities and pettiness of Palestine politics, and elevating all problems into first principles. 

 He was kind enough to give me one or two beautiful specimens of His own handwriting,  together with that of Mishkin —  Qalam, all of which, together with His large signed photograph, were unfortunately burned in the Cyprus fire. 

 I rendered my last sad tribute of affectionate homage when in 1921 I accompanied  Sir Herbert Samuel to the funeral of 'Abbas Effendi. We walked at the head of a train of all religions up the slope of Mount Carmel, and I have never known a more united expression of regret and respect than was called forth by the utter simplicity of the ceremony. 

  (From an address delivered at the opening of the 

Baha'i Centenary Exhibition
in London, May, 1944.)    

  My first connection with the Baha'i Faith dates from the beginning of this century, when it was my fortune and honour to become  the Arabic pupil of Edward Browne. 

 My first glimpse of 'Abbas Effencli was in the summer of 1909, when I drove round the Bay of Acre in an Arab cab, visited him in the barracks and marvelled at his serenity and cheerfulness after 42 years of exiie and imprisonment.  I kept touch with him through my confidential agent, 1-Lusayn ]3ey Ruhi, son of a Tabriz martyr, and the ttPersian Mystic" of my book rrOrientations~ After the Young Turk Revolution, 'Abbas Effendi was released. 

 He visited Egypt in 1913, when I had the honour of looking after him, and of presenting him to Lord Kitchener, er, who was deeply impressed by his personality  — as who could fail to be? 

 Then war cut him off from us and it might have gone hard with him in Haifa but for the indirect interposition of His Majesty's Government. 

 When, in his famous victory drive to the North, Allenby captured Haifa, he detached me from Jerusalem to organise the British Administration there. On the evening of my arrival I visited my revered friend. ~ found him sitting in spotless white. He placed at my disposal the training and talents of his community, and I appointed one or two to positions of trust, which they still continue to deserve." Later, he visited me in Jerusalem,  and was held in great esteem and respect  by the High Commissioner, Lord Samuel. 

 In Egypt he presented me with a beautiful specimen of writing by the celebrated Baha calligraphist, Mishqin Qalam, and with his own Persian pen box; in Palestine  with an exquisite little Bokkara rug from the tomb of the BTh: all three, alas, destroyed by fire in Cyprus. When, on November  29, 1921, he was buried, 10,000 men, women and children, of many varying races and creeds, walked in the funeral procession up Mount Carmel, to lay his body in the exquisite cypress-avenued shrine. 

    Telegrams reached Haifa   
from all over the world.  

 Mr. Winston Churchill, then Secretary  of State for the Colonies, desired the High Commissioner for Palestine to convey to the Baha'i Community on behalf of His Majesty's Government their sympathy and condolence on the death of Sir 'Abdu'l-Baha 'AhMs, K.I3.E., and Field Marshal Lord Allenby telegraphed likewise from Egypt. 
    With 'Abbas Effendi the   

Apostolic and Heroic Age  

 of the Baha'i Faith is considered to be ended. 

 I have not lost contact with the Baha'i world, and I hope I never shall. 

 Recently I had the honour of receiving at the British Legation in Tihr~n, a deputation of the Baha'i Community, headed by Samimi, the respected Chief Munshi of the Legation, and Varga, President of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia. 

 Later I was received by the Council at a tea, so sumptuous  that the remembrance adds a sting to my British Ration Card. 

 My diary of April 5, 1943, at $hir&z, tells me:

510            THE BAHA'I WORLD

  "After luncheon, off to visit the House of the IB~b, leaving the car for the narrow winding streets, and shown over by Faziullali 3enana and the curator. A small but perfect courtyard, with a little blue tiled, eight feet square tank, six large red goldfish, a tiny orange tree and runner carpets round the sides, and a narrow deep well. Above, His bed and His. sitting rooms (for which our hosts took off their shoes), and on the second floor the room in which in 1844 He declared His mission, to a solitary disciple." 

 What can I say more? Half a century ago the great Dr. Jowett, of Balliol, wrote: ttThis is the greatest light the world has seen since Christ, but it is too great and too close for the world to appreciate its full import." Already over many parts of the globe there are Baha'is actively, honourably, peaceably employed. 

 May this auspicious centenary prove propitious  alsn for the early restoration of world peace.

  Even as early as 1929 or perhaps even a little earlier, I used to hear the names of Baha'u'llah and BahA'iism; and in 1929 when I undertook a lecturing tour in Europe on the humanistic methods of promoting peace and unity among races, nations and individuals,  my attention was once again drawn to Baha'u'llah and his teachings by my friend Lady Blomfield, who gave me some books, too, on the subject. But my eyes were then too weak to permit any reading, and the need and urgency of some expert treatment for my eyes was in fact an additional reason for my leaving for Europe. 

 Besides, I was then too full of my own philosophy of "Hu-manism,"  and was too busy with my own programme of lectures for Europe, and did not acquaint myself with any full details about the Baha and their tenets and principles. 

 Perhaps, I imagined that the Baha'is were some sort of religious or philosophical mystics, and I was not particularly interested  in any mere mysticism or in any merely theoretical creed, however much its conclusions  might be logical and satisfying to the intellect. 

 When afterwards, in 1933, the Second Parliament of Religions or the World 

Fellowship  of Faiths    

 was held in Chicago — a conference inspired by the high ideals of mutual understanding, goodwill, co-opera-tion and peace and progress, and I went there to attend and participate in the conference,  my attention was again drawn to the Baha'i Faith by some of its followers there, who took me to their temple at Wil-mette,  Illinois, which was then under construction  but was nearly finished, and showed me the nine gates and chambers of worship for the nine principal religions of the world. Naturally enough, I took it that BahA'iism was something like theosophy, which is interested in studying and comparing  the respective merits of religions and in recognising their respective greatness, and which can therefore appeal only to the in —  tellectual section of mankind and hardly appeal to the masses. 

 Later, in 1936, however, while I was in Rangoon, I had an opportunity, rather, the opportunity was thrust upon me — to acquaint  myself more fully with the tenets and teachings of BaM'iism. 

 Mr. S. Schop-flocher, a Baha'i from Canada, who was on a lecturing tour, was then in Rangoon, and I was asked to introduce him to the public and to preside over a lecture of his. Therefore  I secured a few books on the subject, and on reading them, I was struck with the remarkable fact that BahA'iism is a faith, which not merely recognises the respective merits of the world religions, but goes a step further and teaches that all religions are One, all the religious seers, saints and prophets are the religious seers, saints and prophets of One religion only, that all mankind  is One, and that we must think and feel and act in terms of brotherhood. 

 CCWC must realise," as a Baha'i very beautifully puts it, "that, as the aeroplane, radio and other instruments have crossed the frontiers drawn upon the map, so our sympathy and spirit of oneness should rise above the influences that have separated race from race, class from class, nation from nation and creed front creed. One destiny now controls all human affairs. The fact of world-unity stands out above all other interests  and considerations."

REFERENCES TO THE BAHA'I FAITH                                511

  Sometime back, in this year, Mr. N. R. Vakil, a Baha'i gentleman of Surat, gave me a copy of the book, The Baha'i 

World:                    

 19361938.    Though I have not been able to read the whole book through, I find it is a mine of information, a regular cyclopzdia on the subject. 

 It is interesting to read that the origin of the faith was in Persia, where a mystic prophet who took the name of "Bab" (which means "") began the mission among the Persians in the early part of the nineteenth century, that he and his disciples were persecuted by the Persian Government and were finally shot in 1850, that, notwithstanding the persecution, the movement spread under the able and inspiring  leadership of Baha'u'llah, its principal prophet and exponent, that on his death in 1892 he was succeeded by his son, 'Abdu'l-Baha,  who continued the work till 1921, when, on his death, his grandson, Shoghi Effendi, became the head of the community — a community now numbering nearly a million and spread in all the five continents of the world. 

 Though the traditionally orthodox Hindus,  Muslims, Christians, etc., may not agree to call themselves Baha'is or even to subscribe to its main tenet, viz., 

 that all religions  are One, I think that the really enlightened  among them can have no conscientious objection and will indeed wholeheartedly subscribe to it. Another important aspect of the Baha'i Faith is its absolutely nonpolitical nature. In the Golden Age of the Cause of Baha'u'llah Shoghi Effendi categorically rules out any participation by adherents of the Faith, either individually or collectively, in any form of activity which might be interpreted  as an interference in the political affairs  of any particular government. So that no government need apprehend any sort of danger or trouble from Bah&iism. 

 On the whole, the perusal of the Book The BaN'! 

 World: 19361938 has deeply impressed me with the belief that the principles of BaM'iism, laying stress as they do on the Oneness of mankind, and being directed  as they are towards the maintenance of peace, unity and cooperation among the different classes, creeds and races of people, will go a long way in producing a healthy atmosphere in the world for the growth of Fellowship and Brotherhood of Man. 

 Further,  I see no harm in the followers of other faiths accepting these main principles of BahA'iism, wherein, I think, they can find nothing against the teachings of their own prophets, saints and seers. I rather think that by accepting these main principles of Bah&'iism they will help in hastening the establishment  of a New World Order, an idea perhaps first clearly conceived by Baha'u'llah and which every thinking man will now endorse as a ~tconsummation to be devoutly wished for."

The best account  of him in English is that published in 1903 by G. P. Putnam's Sons under the title of the Life and Teachings of 'Abbas Effendi compiled by Myron H. Phelps chiefly from information supplied by ]lahiy-yih  KMnum. She states that her brother's birth almost coincided with the ttmanifesta-don"  of Mirza 'Au Muhammad the B~b (24th May, 1844), and that she was his junior by three years. Both dates are put three years earlier by another reputable authority,  but in any case both brother and sister were mere children when, after the great persecution of the B~bis in 1852 their father Baha'u'llah and his family were exiled from Persia, first to Baghd&d (185263) then to Adrianople (18638), and lastly to 'Akka (St. Jean d'Acre) in Syria, where Baha'u'llah died on 28th May, 1892, and which his son 'Abdu'l-Baha was oniy permitted  to leave at will after the Turkish Revolution in 1908. Subsequently to that date he undertook several extensive journeys in Europe and America, visiting London and

One of the most notable practical results of the Baha'i ethical teaching in the United States has been, according to the recent testimony of an impartial and qualified observer, the establishment in Baha'i circles in New York of a real fraternity between black and white, and an unprecedented lifting of the ttcolor bar," described by the said observer as "almost miraculous." 

 Ample materials exist even in English for the study of the remarkable personality who has now passed from our midst and of the doctrines he taught; and especially authoritative  are the works of M. Hippolyte Dreyfus  and his wife (formerly Miss Laura Clifford  Barney), who combine intimacy and sympathy with their hero with sound knowledge  and wide experience. In their works and in that of Mr. Myron H. Phelps must be sought those particulars which it is impossible to include in this brief obituary notice.

  EaM'iism insists on points which constitute  the essentials of the several creeds and faiths which have divided and still divide the human family. 

 It seeks thereby to establish human unity. It inculcates pursuit of truth through the miasma of superstitions old and new. These features ought to secure for BahA'iism an enduring place in the religions of the world. 

 It is one of the noblest contributions  which Asia has made to human civilization. 

 The history of its martyrdom in Tihdn is a glorious chapter, indicating how much suffering the awakened human spirit can endure for the sake of its convictions. In the world as one sees it today, divided and torn asunder by warring ambitions, EahA'iism has undoubtedly a great part to play. 

 B~ PROF.     BENOY KUMAR SARKAR, M.A., Ph.D. For over a quarter of a century, — since my American days, — I have been under the conviction that the Baha'i movement serves to expand the intellectual and moral personality of every individual that comes into contact with it. The movement has set in motion some of those currents of thought and work which lead to the silent but effective conversion of men and women to humaner and world-embracing principles of daily conduct. 

 Because of these creative forces in the social domain the Baha'i movement  is to be appreciated as one of the profoundest emancipators of mankind from the tradition of race-chauvinism and etlino-re. ligious bigotry. 

 With best wishes and greetings, I remain, Cordially Yours, 

                Benoy Sarker.              
                           
B~ MRS. SAROJINU NAIDU     

  (Hyderabad, Deccan, February 1, 1941.) The founder of the Baha'i Faith is undoubtedly  one of the Great Seers of the Modern Age. The Gospel that he enunciated  and the programme that he enjoined upon his followers are singularly like a prophecy of the ideal and dream that inspire  the heart of youth with (the) quest for a brave new world built upon equity, fellowship and peace. 

 In the midst of all the tragic horror of hate and bloodshed that surround us today, his message to humanity does indeed fulfill the meaning of his name, and carries the ttglory of God" into the darkness.

 Mirza 'Au-Muhammad, the Bab, or the portal of a new wisdom, — a young man, brave, handsome, and tempered like a steel blade, the finest product of his country. This new Alexander, "the beloved of the worlds," subjugator of souls, died in 1850 at the age of thirty-one, having shed no blood but his own, a martyr of spotless iove, of universal charity. 

 The B~bis, his partisans, were "beheaded, hanged, blown from the mouth of cannons,


<p513>

  burnt, or chopped to pieces." 

 Their homes were burned, their womenfolk carried off or executed. Still the movement progressed. Scarcely had the Bab's mission begun, — he was allowed a bare two years of preaching, —  when he was cast into prison, questioned, bastinadoed, disfigured, then tried for heresy before a clerical court, and finally put to death. 

 The B&b was led to the scaffold at Tabriz with a young devotee who had implored to share his fate. About two hours before noon the two were suspended by ropes, under their armpits, in such a manner that the head of the disciple rested against the breast of his beloved master. Armenian soldiers received the order to fire; but when the smoke cleared, the Rib and his companion were found to be unscathed. 

 The bullets had merely severed the ropes by which they were suspended. 

 Amazed by what they considered a miracle, the soldiers were unwilling  to fire again. They were replaced by a more docile squad, and this time the volley took effect. The bodies of both victims  were riddled by bullets and horribly mutilated, but their faces, spared by a strange caprice of destiny, bore an expression  of radiant transfiguration. 

 All Europe was stirred to pity and indignation. 

 The event occurred on the ninth of July, 1850; among the t~litterateurs" of my generation, in the Paris of 1890, the martyrdom of the Bib was still as fresh a topic as had been the first news of his death. We wrote poems about him. Sarah Bernhardt entreated Catulle Mend&s for a play on the theme of this historic tragedy. When he failed to suppiy a manuscript, I was asked to write a drama entitled "Her Highness the Pure," dealing with the story of another illustrious martyr of the same causer — a woman, 

Qurratu'1-'Ayn, the Persian

 Joan of Arc and the leader of emancipation for women of the Orient. 

 Her case was unique. Had it been admissible  for a woman to be a Malidi, or a (point" Qurratu'1-'Ayn, — who bore resemblance  to the medirval HMoYse and the neoplatonic Hypatia, — would have been recognized as the equal of the DAb. 

 Such virile courage and power did she inherit that all who saw and heard her were uplifted to a new understanding of the mission of her sex. 

 A poeress, philosopher, linguist, and theologian, an early convert of the Bib, she threw aside her veil, despite the immemorial custom of Asia, carried on controversies  with the most learned scholars of her country, discomfited them, and won recognition as their master. Imprisoned, anathematized, driven from town to town, stoned in the streets, she defied, singlehanded,  a SjPh who "through his decree could slaughter a thousand men each day," — and often did so. To her executioners she said, "You may kill me as soon as you please, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women." Then, having donned her choicest  robes, as if to join a bridal party, she was dragged into a garden and strangled by a negro. 

 The Bib had exhorted the people to purify themselves that they might welcome the Divine Sun, of whom he was the Radiant Morn. 

 When the Rib declared his mission in 1844, Mirza ~usayn-'Ali, a young man of twenty-seven, the son of a vizier, and of royal descent, boldly espoused the perilous cause. 

 Prison and exile soon became his portion.  Scenes were enacted during this period which recall the Terror in France, with its horrors and its heroism. 

 Baha'is, previously members of antagonistic  sects, have manifested toward every one, even their enemies, a spirit of help and amity. We can only be glad that persecutions have diminished and that a gentle and ennobling influence has regenerated the Orient, from Syria to Burma. It is quite possible that BahA'iism has a mission to pacify and spiritually quicken races and tribes which we have so far been unable to evangelize. 
                           
By the late SIR JOHN MARTIN

 HARVEY, D.Litt. 

 You honour me with a request that I should add my small brick to the exalted edifice of the Baha'i teaching. 

 Its happy creed so passionately urged and so convincingly stated is an inspiration to all who work and who, in the words of Kipling, have


<p514>
514

                  THE BAHA'I WORLD

  realised the significance of "No one shall work for money and no one shall work for fame, but all for the joy of the working." 

 I would like to add my conviction to your teaching that reabsolute equality is a chimera" which, socially, is entirely impracticable. 

 It has become a slogan to many workers, reliance upon which will oniy lead to a cruel disillusionment. 

 The only ttequality~~ is that which any man may attain by being prominent in his work. It has been truly said that man can do some one thing better than any other man." So let our ambition be, no matter how humble our work may appear, to be of the aristocracy of work. And if to "work is to pray" may not this noble ambition to be among the elect of the workers of the world, bring us by steps to the dream of your great Teacher of a Great Universal Peace, against which if any government among you take up arms to destroy that peace, ~'the whole human race," he tells, !chall resolve with every power at its disposal  to destroy." 

  B~ DR. HEWLETT JOHNSON, 

    Dean of Canterbury         

  I read with interest the social programme of your movement demonstrating the best education for everyone, equal status for men and women and the like and also your encouragement  of scientific research and emphasis on the need for a World Commonwealth,  together with the oneness of mankind. 

 I am in complete agreement with those aims and wish you well in the pursuit of them.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE SERVICES
OF SIYYID MUSTAFA ROMI    
                          
     B~ ABBASALI BUTT          

  Siyyid Mugafi belonged to a noble family  of Baghdad, 'Iraq. His father had settled in Madras. 

 When Su1aym~in KMn IlyAs, popularly known as JamAl Effendi, the first Baha'i teacher sent by Baha'u'llah to India in 1875 arrived at that town Siyyid. 

 Mu~;af 5 was in his early twenties. He was very spiritual  and very careful in the observance of his religious duties. The moment, therefore, he came in contact with the commanding personality of Jam~1 Effendi, he was attracted  to him. 

 He sat and listened to his talks which presented religious truth from quite a different angle from that in vogue at the time. 

 He was convinced and enamoured  of this new Revelation and when JamAl Effendi left Madras he accompanied him and travelled with him throughout India and Burma. 

 On reaching Burma in 1878 he left the company of JamM Effendi and settled in Rangoon where he married in a well-to-do Indo-Burman family of traders. His broth-ers-in-law  were all very prosperous and be joined them in their bu;iness. 

 Prior to the arrival of Jam&1 Effendi in Burma, another Persian youth from Shiriz, HAji Siyyid Mehdi, had settled in Rangoon and had married in a rich Persian-Burman family. 

 Although he was from a Baha'i family, being alone and not very learned, he was quiescent. When Jam6.1 

 Effendi came he found support and rendered every possible  help to that teacher of the Divine Faith. 

 JamM Effendi succeeded in establishing  two Baha'i groups, one in Rangoon and the other in Mandalay. 

 Siyyid Mu~;afi who was an erudite scholar and knew Muslim  theology very well, followed up bis teacher's work and under the direction of 'Abdu'l-Baha succeeded in developing those Baha'i groups into fullfledged spiritual Assemblies. 

 For a long time, however, owing to his business he could devote oniy a part of his time to the service of the Faith; but in 1910 the link connecting him with worldly affairs broke abruptly. The firm of which he was a partner failed, and, soon after, his wife died. He was now once mare entirely detached and he devoted his whole time to the service of the Divine Faith. In 1899 he carried to the Holy Land, with other Baha, the marble casket made by the Baha'is of Mandalay for the Holy Remains of the Bib. He was received by 'Abdu'l-Baha most graciously and was the recipient of special favours. 

 Besides consolidating the centres at Rangoon and Mandalay he was assisted to establish  a new centre in Daidanaw, a village in the township of Kungyangoon. 

 It so happened that the headman of Daidanaw was embroiled in some legal case and he was in trouble. 

 In the court of Rangoon when his bail application was admitted there was no one to stand surety for him because he was a stranger to the place. One of the Baha'is of Rangoon, 'Abdu'1-Karim by name, happened to be in the court. He at once offered himself and another friend as sureties for the headman. 

 This impressed the headman and his companions and they inquired of 'Abdu'1-Karim to which Faith he belonged and when told of Baha'u'llah and His Great Message they evinced a great desire to hear it in detail. 

 They were brought to Siyyid Mustaf~ who convinced them about the truth of the new Revelation. The headman and his party went back to their village and related their unique experience to the people. The elders of the village held a consultation and decided to invite Siyyid Mugaf~ to their village to teach them the new Faith of God. Siyyid Mu~;af& did it in. his own convincing manner and the whole village embraced the Cause en masse. Siyyid Mu~;af& set about 517

  Siyyid Mu~af A Rami of Burma, named by the Guardian as one of the Hands of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, u'11~h, contributed his imperishable services from the year 1875, when he embraced the Faith through the inspired efforts of JamAl Effendi, the first teacher sent to India by the instruction of Baha'u'llah. He was nearly ninety-nine years old at the time of his tragic death at Thingagyun. 

  bettering the lot of these people. With financial aid from Rangoon Baha'is he started a school in the village and translated many important books such as the "Book of Iqan," the 

"Hidden Words" and "Some  

 Answered Questions," into Burmese for their edification. 

 He supervised the tianslation into Urdu of "Maoi1a-i-Sayy~h" which was printed undcr the title of ttMbu1-Hay~t." He compiled in Urdu "Almayarus-Sahih" (The True Criterion) which proved a great aid to Baha'i teachers in India. 

 In addition he translated into Burmese "Baha'i Prayers" and wrote "Lessons in Religion" in that language. 

 In 1911 when a religious conven don was held at Allababad and leaders of various religions were asked to speak on their religious ideals, Siyyid Mu~;afi wrote a thesis on the Baha'i Faith, which our ever dearly remembered brother the late Mr. 

Raugnath Narayanrao Vakil 

 read at the convention, and was freely distributed among the mixed audience. 

 The thesis told the people of India in plain words the history and the teachings of the Baha'i Faith for world religion and incidentally showed that the differences in the various warring communities of India could not be eliminated unless religion and politics were stopped from meddling with each other's affairs.


<p519>
IN MEMORIAM                   519

  Siyyid Mu~af A had a very sweet temper. He was an erudite scholar and knew the religious books of the Jews, the Christians, the Muslims and the Buddhists. 

 He had a talent for bringing out their teachings in the light of the Baha'i Message in his own sweet way and in such a convincing manner that a beginner became enamoured and con —  vinced. He might not, for worldly considerations, join the Baha'i Fold; but he knew for certainty in his heart of hearts, that no other Faith could redeem the world at the present time of the ills that had beset it. Throughout his life Siyyid Mu§tafi served the Cause of humanity by showing the pea-pie  the true path of felicity and salvation as taught by Baha'u'llah and many were the souis that found the elixir of life at his hands. 

 Siyyid MustafA had a unique capacity that most teachers lack. He was a great administrator. 

 He would not only teach his beginners but would lead them to form themselves into a group and thus lay the foundation of a Spiritual Assembly, the first unit in the 

New World Order of Baha'u'llah. 

 Power to teach and power to organize  are two chief capacities which make a perfect ]lah&'i teacher and Siyyid Mu~tafi possessed both in abundance. 

 Siyyid Mu~af& passed the two greatest tests which confronted every person who claimed to be a Baha'i. 
On the occasion of the     

Ascension of Baha'u'llah   

 when the N~iqi4in spread their nefarious propaganda which had its ramifications in Bombay and in other Baha'i centers in India, Siyyid Mu~af 4 stood valiantly for the Covenant of God and so firmly countered their efforts that it was not oniy prevented from spreading  outside the area of Bombay but was driven out of that city also. 

 Again, when in 1921 'Abdu'l-Baha passed to the Supreme Concourse and according to His last "Will and 

Testament" Shoghi Rab-bani 

 was appointed the first Guardian of the Cause of God and the N~qi~Iin had once more started their efforts by bringing in quotations from the "Aqdas," Siyyid Mustaf~ stood like a mountain and vigorously taught the friends to follow the 'tWill and Testament"  of the great Master, showing them from the writings of Baha'u'llah that the N~quiz Akbar had forfeited his privilege by disobeying the Commandments of RaM'-u'llAh  so explicitly given in the "Book of Covenant." 

 Siyyid Mu~;af~ visited the Holy Land twice during the time of 'Abdu'l-Baha and once after His passing. 

 He was loved by the great Master and was the recipient of many loving tablets from Him. Siyyid Mu~vaf~ was entirely detached from the world and what it contains. I-fe loved and adored the beloved Guardian to such a degree that in all his actions in his daily life he followed his example. 

 He knew that the beloved Guardian ioved and appreciated nothing but work and service for the Divine Faith and he worked and worked for it day and night unmindful of his health or welfare. 

 He was about 99 years of age at the time of his death but his spiritual being was as young or even younger than the spirit of a youth of 22 years. 

 If he heard that there was an inquirer he would walk long distances and visit the inquiring soul and many a time he succeeded in scraping away the dross and bringing out the reality buried beneath the litter and rubbish of tradition and imitation. His method was to make the inquirer, in the first instance, self-sufficing in his search for the truth. He would remove his doubts about his capability to understand religious sublects. 

 He would eliminate from his mind the attitude of dependence upon socalled religious leaders. He would then lead him to sift out the truth from the motley of dogmas and manmade beliefs inherited from the ancestors. He would build his argument on the knowledge of the inquirer and convince him of the Truth proclaimed by Baha'u'llah. 

   The beloved Guardian's     

 cablegram is a fitting tribute to a life spent in the service of the 

Divine Faith of Baha'u'llah.

 The cablegram runs: "Hearts griefstricken passing Supreme Concourse distinguished pioneer Faith Baha'u'llah,  dearly beloved staunch high minded noble soul Siyyid MugafA. Long record his superb services (in) both teaching (and) administrative fields shed lustre on both heroic and formative ages (of)

 18691945  

  B~ ELLA GOODALL COOPER    

  ttEmogene~~ as she was familiarly known to the Baha'is, passed away December 15, 1945, after more than forty-seven years as an active national and international Baha teacher. 

 She was born in the small California  mining town of Copperopolis on the 27th of September in the year 1869. Her father, Dr. Martin, having died when she was very young, and her mother having remarried, she went to live with an aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. William Henry Wright, in San Francisco, where later she was graduated from the Irving Institute, a select boarding school for young ladies of those days. 

 In her early twenties she married John Ketchie Hoagg, who died in San Francisco in 1918. 

 A few years after her marriage Emogene went to Europe to pursue her musical studies, remaining there several years. 

 Upon her return  to California she visited at the home of a family friend, Mrs. Phoebe Apperson Hearst, in Pleasanton, and it was there, in 1898, that she first heard of the Baha'i Faith. Dr. and 

Mrs. Edward Christopher Getsinger

 had come from Chicago hoping to interest Mrs. Hearst in the new Revela-don. 

 Emogene was so attracted by Mrs. Getsinger's earnest manner that she sought daily lessons with her, resulting in Emo-gene's  instant acceptance of the Faith. 

 Concerning  this she wrote: CCMY interest augmented from ksson to lesson. 

 The first commune, ~O my God, give me knowledge, faith and love,' was constantly on my lips, and I believe those Words from the Fountain of Eternal Light awakened my soul and mind to a faith that has never wavered." 

 In this way Emogene became the first confirmed  believer in California. 

 Mrs. Hearst herself had been deeply impressed by the Baha'i story and decided to include in the Egyptian tour she was planning  for the fall of that year a special trip to 'Akka to see 'Abdu'l-Baha and further investigate the Revelation. Emogene accompanied  Mrs. Hearst as far as Paris and then proceeded to Italy to continue her vocal course. At Milan, in 1899, she received her first Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha in acknowledgment of her letter of acceptance of the Faith which she had written before leaving California. 

 However, it was not until November,  1900, in company with Mrs. Helen Ellis Cole, of New York, and Miss Alma Albertson, that she had an opportunity to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Those fourteen days at 'Akka and Haifa were her ~tspiritual baptism."  Afterward, at 'Abdu'l-Baha's suggestion, she spent a month in Port Sa'id in order to study the. Baha'i interpretation of the Bible with the renowned Persian teacher, Mirza Abu'1-Fadl. Of that period Emogene wrote; "I knew no one at Port Sa'id and met none but Baha'is during my stay there; but I was not lonely for I was treated as a sister by the kind friends. 

 For four weeks Mirza Abu'1-Fadl received me at the home of Nur'-u'lIah  Effendi twice a day, morning and evening, and gave me such explicit instruction on the Bible that for the first time this Book became an open page. 

 It was not without difficulty that I got the explanation. Sometimes Nur'u'llah Effendi would give me the meaning in Italian, and at other times Abmad Yazdi Effendi would translate into French. 

 Then I would put their words into English. After about two weeks Anton FE-fendi  1-laddad was sent to Port Sa'id, and he translated directly into English. Almost every evening five or six of the IlahA'i brothers would meet with us to hear Mirza Abu'1-FaQl's explanations. 
Those were won

IN MEMORIAM                   521

        Mrs. Henrietta Emogene Martin Hoagg

  derful days, — to think that I, an American woman, was able to meet with these Baha'i brothers of a different nationality and in a foreign country, and to feel so perfectly at home, just as though I had been with my own family! Probably to them it was yet a more novel experience to be able to meet with an unveiled sister. All this has been brought about by the power of Baha'u'llah. I was still at Port Sa'id at Christmas time and was honored at dinner by the presence of Mirza 

Abu'1-Fadl, Alimad Yazdi  
Effendi and Anton Effendi 
1-laddad. Dear Mirza Abu'1-Fadl

 did not wish to go into the large dining-room at the hotel, so we had a private room and he entertained us by relating Baha'i incidents in his life." 

 This intensive study was the beginning of Emogene's long labor of 'ove, an exhaustive  compilation titled "The Three Con" ditions of Existence: Servitude, Prophethood, and Deity," which was not finished until shortly before her death. 

 Going back in January, 1903, to California, where occasional Baha'i meetings had been held in the Oakland home of Mrs. Helen S. Goodall and her daughter, Emogene Ipined with them in establishing regular weekly gatherings. 

 Then, during the absence of Mrs. Goodall and her daughter on a visit to Akka in 1907 and 1908, she carried  on the meetings in her own home, and in addition started a second weekly group especially for study. 

 In the absence of Mrs. Goodall in November  of 1907, Emogene represented California  at a consultation meeting in the home of Mrs. Corinne True in Chicago. Nine communities responded to the call for the purpose  of initiating the Baha'i Temple work. Mrs. True has recorded: "Emogene's flaming spirit of devotion was one of the pioneer pillars to accomplish that great step in the progress of the Faith in this country." 

 The intervening years until the end of the First 

World War saw Emogene     
in divers

  places from California to Washington, D. C., and even to Italy, Egypt and the Holy Land. 

     When the Teaching Tablets 

 of 'Abdu'1-. BaM reached the United States Emogene felt an urge to go to Alaska. ReceiVing a cablegram of confirmation from 'Abdu'l-Baha, she was encouraged to undertake the long and difficult trek in the cold North. 

 No doubt the most unique of her many teaching endeavors was this one made with Miss 

Marian Elizabeth Jack     

 of New Brunswick.  From San Francisco, in July, 1919, they took steamer to Nome and St. Michael, reaching those ports on the 26th, thence up the Yukon River to Fairbanks, on to Dawson and Whitehorse in Canada, down to Skagway and Juneau in Alaska. Then Miss Jack remained in Juneau while Emogene alone, in September, made the circuit by water over to Cordova, Valdez, Seward and Anchorage, all of which places gave her excellent  newspaper publicity. 

 The long, leisurely trip up the Yukon aboard the "Julia B" was filled with amusing happenings as well as excitement. 

 To begin with, all of Emogene's baggage, except one suitcase, had been accidentally left behind in Seattle, but, as noted in her diary: "Extra wraps and even Indian moccasins will be loaned by the Captain, sweaters by the Purser, and all sorts of things are convertible  into necessary robes for the night. The freedom from worry about baggage is a noticeable feature of our travels; in fact, this is a splendid region in which to practice not thinking about what one wears and what one eats.~~ Everywhere along the route 

Emogene and Miss Jack     

 had met the dwellers m the towns and Indian villages, either on the tier if the stop were a short one or, if longer, in the hotel lobbies, dining-rooms, lodge halls or movie theaters, which latter would sometimes run slides announcing a Baha'i talk. Miss Jack would set up her easel anywhere and begin sketching. She made friends through her smiles and merry quips, and Emogene would soon introduce the subject of the Baha'i Revelation. 

 Where public lectures were given pamphlets would be distributed, and usually an ice cream ~ would fol-'ow  at the drug store or in a private home. 

 At Ruby they held an impromptu meeting  on the sidewalk. 

    At Tenana the Message     

 was given to a Chinese who owned the restaurant where they had their meals. 

 Mr. Lee asked for literature, and to every patron he would hand a pamphlet, saying: CtThis is very good. You read. Do you lot of good." 

 At Cordova Emogene wrote in her diary: ttWhile I gave oniy one public talk, the whole town was astir with the 

Message.                  

 It really rejoices one to know that the hearts are being prepared so opportunely, and that all we have to do is to lend our services. 

 "Some of the women at Anchorage helped to arrange talks at the Women's Club, the City Club, before the Pioneers (women and men), also at the picture show, and the High School Auditorium. 

 They thought it was wonderful to travel and teach without taking  pay, and that it was a privilege to hear the addresses. I stand in awe at the power of the Spirit that will provide these means and opportunities." 
    Emogene returned to Juneau

December 21st. Notwithstanding

 the Christmas holidays, a series of dinner and teaching engagements ensued at many private homes and, on the evening of the 30th, she spoke at a public meeting in 

Odd Fellows Hall. On New  

 Year's Eve she and Miss Jack attended the reception given by Governor and Mrs. Riggs. 
   Late that same evening    

Mrs. Georgia Grayson     

 Ralston, of San Francisco, arrived from New York in order to accompany Emogene on some short trips out of Juneau. 

 After a hurried jaunt to Sitka, Wrangell and Ketch-kan,  fraught with near disaster due to inclement  weather and severe storms, they retraced their steps to Juneau, and at the invitation of the Mayor held one public meeting in the 

City Council Chambers.    

 During their stay in Sitka it was the Greek holiday season~ with a dance every evening. Since they could, therefore, not obtain a hail, Mrs. Ralston wondered what they could do. Nothing daunted, Emogene replied: "Well, if we cannot get a hail on account of a masked ball, we will go to the ball. 

 There we are sure to see everyone, and some may be willing to listen to us." Not


<p523>
IN MEMORLAM                   523

  only did they go to the ball, but they did interest a number of persons and, moreover, they were invited to be two of the five judges of the best sustained character of the eve-fling. 

 At Wrangell they had two meetings in Van Arta's Barber Shop. The proprietor was a devout Bible student and offered his shop for meetings "any evening after 8:30 and on Sunday afternoons." 
     As they were about to leave

Wrangell, Judge Thomas     

 presented to each of them a little pin made of Alaska gold, at the same time thanking them for having "brought much to him in the Teachings." 

 In a letter from W~rangell to a friend in Washington, D. C., dated January 15, 1920, Emogene wrote: (Cone must adapt the way to the needs, and the main thing is to have the people learn about the Faith. I know I shall miss the pioneer spirit of Alaska. I certainly like it here." 

 From Juneau Emogene and Mrs. Ralston began the homeward journey, sailing 

February  24th from Vancouver
for San Francisco.        

 Though Emogene was not the first LBaM'i teacher to visit Alaska and spend some time there, she was truly a pioneer in the sense that she opened new territory and sowed the seed for future garners. 

 Her entire tour of Alaska, by boat and rail, covered eight months and a total of more than six thousand miles, not including the sea voyage from San Francisco to Nome. 

     Almost immediately Emogene 

 left for Italy, later for Haifa, but was back in Italy by November of 1920. 

 In 1921, at Naples, she met Mr. and Mrs. Stuart W. French, who were en route from California to see 'Abdu'l-Baha.  When they returned to Italy they went with Emogene, according to 'Abdu'l-Baha instructions, to Rome and Florence to call upon those whom she had interested in the Faith, and for several successive years their paths crossed in various parts of Europe. 

     In 1928, at Miss Julia     

 Culver's earnest plea, and with the approval of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, Emogene went to Geneva, Switzerland, to assist in conducting the affairs of the International 

Baha'i                     

 Bureau. * Under her efficient supervision the Bureau was soon functioning smoothly, and in 193 0 she and Miss Culver were elected joint treasurers. Capable coworkers they had in Mrs. Anne Lynch and Miss Margaret Lentz, who selflessly served many years. 

 Shoghi Effendi, in 1931, summoned Emo-gene  to Haifa for the purpose of typing the voluminous manuscript of "The Dawn-Breakers" which he. was then translating into English from the original Persian. Upon completing that arduous and important task she returned to Geneva and remained there until 1935. 

  Then, in the United States again and under the direction of the National Teaching Committee, Emogene traveled through the Middle West and South, to Green Acre in Maine, to the Louhelen Baha'i School in Michigan; and, when Shoghi EIT endi inaugurated the Seven Year Plan for the American Baha'is, she entered enthusiastically into that campaign. In 1940 she accepted an assignment to Cuba, under the Inter-Amer-ica Committee, for which she familiarized herself with Spanish and taught in Havana with much effect. 

 She was quite a linguist, as a matter of fact. She had translated Baha'u'llah and the New Era, the Hidden Words, and other 'Writings, into Italian; helped Miss Margaret Lentz with her translation of the KitAb-i-'Ahd, and the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, into German; and assisted Mine. Rao with the French translation of Baha'u'llah and the New 

Era.                       

 Following the Cuban mission, Emogene had a few months' rest in California, also with friends in Cleveland, Ohio, and in Washington, D. C. She was thus able, in May, 1944, to attend the Thirty-Sixth Annual Convention of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada at Wilmette, Illinois, and the Baha Centenary commemorating the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Baha'i Faith. Returning to Washington, she had expected to start on a teaching trip to Green Acre, Montreal, and Florida; but, because of rapidly failing health, she instead retired to her home in Charleston, South Carolina. Yet she was not idle. Whenever

 she could sit up, she applied herself painstakingly to the completion of her Compilation,  from her bed she taught the visitors who called upon her, and to the end she was a tireless worker in the Baha'i field. 

 Emogene was in her seventy-seventh year at the time of her death. Upon receiving the announcement, Shoghi Effendi cabled the National 

Spiritual Assembly:        

 ~tDeepIy grieved passin.g (of) staunch, exemplary pioneer (of the) Faith, 

Emogene Hoagg. Record      

 (of) national (and) international services unforgettable. 

Reward (in) Ablia Kingdom  
assured (and) abundant."   

 Emogene during her illness had been lovingly  cared for by Miss Josephine Pinson of Charleston, the dear Baha'i friend to whom Emogene had intrusted the manuscript of her book, with the request that she type it for publication. 

 Of those last hours Miss Pinson penned a beautiful account which she sent to Emogene's relatives and intimate friends, with the further information that her body would rest in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston. Briefly, Miss Pinson wrote: 'tThe ~oy with which Emogene announced her imminent departure cannot be described in words. All my experiences connected with her sickness and passing are very sacred to me, and I feel it was a great privilege and blessing to have been the one to serve her in her last days. But her glorious departure overshadows all other sentiments, and I wish all could have shared it with me. She wore an expression of supreme happiness until she was freed from the cage of this world." 

 Letters from many friends have borne witness to the extraordinary qualities of Emogene's mind and spirit. A few excerpts follow: Mrs. Corinne True, of Wilmette, Illinois, wrote: etEmogene was always such a vital character,  full of doing things for others, and never considering herself." 

 Miss Agnes Alexander, of Honolulu, wrote: "Emogene was one of the glorious souls of the early days of the Faith who stood firm in the Covenant of her Lord." 

 Mrs. Kathryn Frankland, whose home is in Berkeley, California, wrote: ttWh     and wherever we were to gether, whether she were sick or well, Emo-gene was always engaged in research for her Compilation, which was her very life. 

 'Abdu'1-Eah~i loved her very much, and His daughters simply adored her, for her sense of humor always buoyed them up in times of depression." 

 Mr. George Orr Latimer, of Portland, Oregon, wrote: "I would say that one of Emogene's outstanding qualities was her firmness in the Covenant; another, the clarity of her teaching, both in the early days of the Faith in America and when she was instructed, by the Guardian, to teach the Baha'i Administrative Order to believers young in the Faith and so bring them ciose to the spirit of 'Abdu'l-Baha." 

 Mrs. Stuart W. French, of San Marino, California, wrote: ccWhen I take up a copy of tThe Dawn-Breakers' I think of Emogene's eager fingers typing word for word that wonderful book, striving to approach that spiritual energy which always actuated the Guardian and which he longed to see in others. Her loyalty and devotion, generosity, modesty and, above all, her deep penetration into, and brilliant explanations of, the Revelation, were a priceless bounty to those who studied with her.~~ Mrs. Anne Lynch wrote from Geneva, Switzerland, where she is still serving at the International Baha'i 

Bureau:                    

 "How much Emogene suffered physically, and how her spirit always remained unbroken  I How many of us owe to her our spiritual training!" 

 Miss Margaret Lent; at present in the United States, wrote: (COne afternoon at the 

International Baha'i Bureau

 in Geneva, when we were entertaining  our little group of Baha'i students, and also some guests from out of town, Maria, a young woman from the Balkans whom Emogene had attracted to the Faith with patient  and loving teaching, was sitting in the reception room downstairs, just having finished  smoking one of her innumerable cigarettes. 

 When Emogene came down shortly before the arrival of the guests, she was shocked by the odor of the smoke. 

And


<p525>
IN MEMORIAM                   525

  what did she do? Did she send Maria away? No! She fetched some attar of rose and sprinkled it on Maria lavishly. And lo and behold, no smoke could be sensed any more, only the most lovely fragrance of roses!" 

 Miss Josephine Kruka wrote from Havana, 

Cuba:                      

 "Our glorious Faith has lost a most profound teacher. Emogene tried her best to make us realize that much of our understanding we must get through the heart, that we must study and meditate. She had the greatest passion for studying the Teachings and imparting them to others. Indeed, she used to say that she never felt well except when she was teaching." 

 Mr. Philip G. Sprague, of New York, one of the younger generation of Baha'is, wrote: ccEmogene~s passing was a real blow to me, because I had been very close to her for many years. 

 She was a great believer, and I think almost had more strength of character than anyone else I have ever known. I have never known any other person to have such adaptability  and determination in meeting the problems of life." 

 Another tribute was from Mr. Charles Mason Remey, of Washington, D. C.; ttEmogene's virtues were many. Perhaps her outstanding human virtue was her keen and most delightful sense of humor. This never failed her and was a constant source of pleasure and joy to all who were near her. 

 ... She went deeply and penetratingly into the Teachings as but few others have done. This made her a Baha'i teacher of Baha'i teachers! I feel that her chief contribution to the Faith in this country was her teaching among the believers themselves. 

 Many had their beliefs and understanding vastly deepened  by Emogene." 

 The foregoing appraisals afford an insight into Emogene's dominant traits of character. Many more could be mentioned; for instance,  her extreme fondness for animals and insistence that they be treated kindly and never abused. 

 A strong sense of justice was a virtue Emogene possessed in large measure. In all her years of association with the Baha'i women of the Orient she did not reconcile herself to the restrictions under which they were obliged to live, for she believed they were entitled to the same privileges the women of the Occident enjoy. One of her cherished dreams was to be able to share in the building of a Baha'i school for girls an Mr. 

Carmel.                    

 In a precious Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha, which Emogene always had with her, occur these several verses as translated by Anton Effendi 1-laddad. 

 ~ thou who art rejoiced at the Glad Tidings of 

God!                       

 tq received thy last letter in which thou showest thy wistful consent to the good pleasure of God, thy resignation to His Will, and thy evanescence in the way of His wish. 
     ~O maidservant of God!    

 I assuredly know thy spiritual feelings, thy merciful thoughts, thy firmness in the Cause of God, and thy straightforwardness in the Testament of God. 

 "It is incumbent upon thee to have good patience and to endure every grave and difficult  matter. 

 Patience is one of the gifts of God, an attribute of the elect, and a mark of the righteous. 

 tC] supplicate God to bestow upon thee a power and a blessing to enable thee to guide sincere servants and devoted maidservants  to enter the Garden of E1-Abha. This is better unto thee than that which is in existence in this world of creation. 
This is a fact!            

 "Be tranquil because of My love to thee and My prayers for thee, and rejoice at all times and under all circumstances. 
     ~ maidservant of God!     

 How excellent is that sentence thou hast written in thy letter: 'It behooveth me to eliminate self (or egotism) so that I will not desire anything but the Will of God.' I-low good is this prayer, and how beautiful is this invocation. Aught else beside this makes it impossible for man to be confirmed by the abundance of the gift of God; neither will he succeed in becoming an humble and submissive servant  or a laborer in His Great Vineyard. 

 "May salutation and praise be upon thee!" 

 Such were the creative words addressed to Emogene by 'Abdu'l-Baha as long ago as 1902. Like fertile seeds, sown in the pure soil of her heart, watered by her conviction, and warmed by the sunshine of His love,

 To possess a saintly life and to purge one's self of all human desires in an age when passions are predominant, and in a country where retrogression and decay have taken it to the abyss of misery and confusion, is a prodigious phenomenon never to be expected except amongst those who are born again through the iove of God. Mesbali is forever glorified by such a life. 

 In the days when the standard of knowi —  edge in Persia was the corrupted theological course of ages gone by, and those who studied the modern arts and sciences were considered heathens, and strongly opposed, Mesbah left his country with the intention of continuing his studies in the French universities  of Beirut. 

 There he proved himself not oniy an ardent scholar and an example of virtue, but also a very promising poet both in Arabic and Persian. Having gained a firm foundation in French, Arabic and Persian literature, he went on to Paris where he continued his studies, helped the orientalists in their research works and aided the early believers of that city in translating the tablets from the Arabic and Persian into the French language. He crowned all his efforts and services by attaining the presence of the Master, and, in the sunshine of 'Abdu'l-Baha's love and encouragement, Mes-bah's  learning bore its finest fruit — the love for and desire to serve mankind. 

 The Master appreciated his erudition and highly praised his extreme sense of courtesy. 

 Having perceived  in that youthful countenance the splendid soul of a steadfast servant of God and a staunch promoter of the Cause, He very kindly recommended him to return to Tihr&n and participate in the Baha'i educational  activities. 

 Posts of outstanding fame and excellent prospects were already awaiting him, when he arrived in 

Persia, but Mesbah's      

 soui soared beyond all lucrative pursuits, temporary rank and worldly desires, and above all his one aim was to carry out his Beloved's wishes. 

     The Spiritual Assembly    
of Tihr6n, with whom the. 

 Master had instructed Mesbah to consult concerning his future activities, found in him a mighty pillar for their education  institutions. 

 He entered that glorious field of service and sacrifice, accepting a very scanty salary and carrying the heaviest weight of responsibilities. 

 During his many years of service as the Head Master of the Tarbiyat Schools, he was a living example of a martyr's constancy. Endless sufferings and unlimited hardships were inflicted upon him by the many who were too shortsighted to perceive the glorious ideals towards which he was untiringly striving, but these oniy served to demonstrate the sublimity of his character and the exaltedness of his endurance. Of what Mesbah had to face during those years, it suffices to say that the Tarbiyat schools, although financially supported by the Baha'is themselves, were under strict orders of the Persian Ministry of Education — a ministry which was a beehive of the archenemies of the Cause and the refuge of the notorious covenant-breakers who constantly endeav-oured to abate the prestige of the Baha'i institutions and even encourage the irresponsible  mobs of the streets and the incorrigible children of other schools to cause endless troubles for the students of the Baha'i Schools. It was the same ministry which caused the publication of certain ignominious  books and magazines which were not oniy the meanest standard of authorship, but also remained as an eternal shame to the press and publications of Persia. 

 Taking all the difficulties in view, we may realize through what a therny path Mesbah had to pass and how the AbliA confirmations bestowed upon him manifold achievements

IN MEMORIAM                  527

  'Aziz'u'llih MesbTh, distinguished promoter of the Cause, teacher and poet. 

  and historical successes. 

 He defended the schools, protected the children and lifted up the souls of his colleagues. He recruited the ablest teachers and managed to raise the standard of teaching in the Baha'i Schools much higher than that of other schools, so much so that the graduates of our institutions  were envied everywhere for their knowledge as well as for their character. The constant abortive attempts of the enemies helped to increase their own jealousy, and pricked to the quick at the lofty prestige of the Baha'i Schools, they did their utmost to raise the hand of their temporarily mighty King against them, and he, ignorant of the Divine wrath and the effect of children's supplications to the Almighty, permitted himself to be an instrument in their hands. 

 No one knows what passed in the heart of Mesbah when he saw his lifetime work fall to pieces, but this we do know that he did not give way to disappointment. Full of certitude in his Master's promises, be brought hope to his scattered and sorrow-stricken children by his repeated and emphatic assertions  that ere long from the depth of this ruined nest of hearts, there would arise institutions glorified in the name of God, worldwide in fame, humanitarian in their objectives, and divine in their eternal salvation  of the children of mankind. 

 Although nothing could weaken Mesbah's mighty soul, his thirty successive years of labour in the schools, greatly affected his physical health. His eyes failed him too, and it was only the light of his insight which helped to soften the pain he felt at their loss. 

 It was hard to believe that our schools were closed, so long as Mesbali was still among us, for in him there was a living school from which the people could learn how to sacrifice their whole lives for a divine ideal, how to hold firm to the hem of the Centre of the Covenant and how to be stead

  fast in the path of God. 

 After the closing of the schools, Mesbah continued teaching in the classes arranged by the local and national  educational committees, and sometimes he went on some most memorable teaching trips in Persia. 

 When the call for pioneers was raised he encouraged his two elder sons to leave Persia while he, with the rest of his family, settled in one of the villages around Tihdn. 

 There he spent his last days before he took his flight to the eternal Kingdom and thus to the very end our Head Master followed  the path of the Beloved Master. 
   With his passing away,     

Persia lost a Mu-tonic     

 grandeur and a Homeric splendour. In his poems one would regain the lost paradise  and would hear the far-off echoes of the battle drums of God's Heroes who fought the darkness of bygone ages and broke through to the dawn of this new and glorious  day of God. 

 In the midst of his loneliness and constant plights, being of an extremely quiet and forebearing nature, Mes.-bali  took refuge in his Beloved's love, at whose threshold he poured forth his pearls of tears. Scholars and men of genuine understanding have judged his poems as unapproachable  by any of his contemporaries and to be placed with the eternal classics of Persia. Yet such was the humility and detachment of Mesbah that none of his poems have been published. 

 But in any meeting or gathering, the friends would persuade him to recite to them some lines of his poems. Streams of joyful tears would flow down their cheeks when he enthusiastically sang his love to the Master: t~An effulgence of 'Abdu'l-Baha's countenance  made my sorrow-laden heart the envy of the promised paradise. Out of pure grace, the Divine Cupbearer filled my chalice with the wine of His covenant. Do you consider it madness to be enchanted by such a glorious  beauty? Hasten then and fetch my chains! 

 Should the waves of calamities encircle  me, my heart never yields to fear and dismay, for His love is my ship and my shore. 

 0! Beloved, make my heart a shrine of divine mysteries, for the books of the sages and their learnings fail to quench the thirst of my soui."'~ *     These lines are nor the exact translation of his verses. 

 Fame and praise were shunned by him, but our Beloved has put his name on the wings of fame and made it soar and blaze in the horizons of eternity. 

 A soul illumined by such a stupendous cause of light, a heart brimful with the Master's love and a memory so vastly and beautifully furnished with a tremendously great number of the divine tablets, verses of the previous Holy writings as well as selections from the world's classics, could only produce poems such as Mesbah's. Though the many references make the lines of his poems too deep for a quick understanding, yet the inherent appeal, the music of meters and rhymes and the hue of the highly spiritual subjects attract the souTh and possess the hearts of the readers and listeners. The love of Baha, his soni inspiring muse, has made each word a shining gem, each line a perfect row of illustrious pearls and each piece a galaxy of eternal stars. 

 Mesbab was a lighthouse for thousands who were bewildered in the dark and stormy seas of circumstances. 

 The light diffused from such a sublime soui had the most assuaging  effect on those who were in spiritual crises. Knowledge, talent and resolution were combined in him with an extreme sense of detachment, condescension and pure intention.  In the obscure path of life he left traces from which the undisturbed melodies of complete consent and utter resignation to the will of God are eternally echoed.

  wonder that Baha'is everywhere were deeply shocked on hearing the sad news of his passing  ~~through the gate into the city" of Life and Light on September 5, 1945. 

 Mt4iammad Sa'id was one of the pillars of the Religion of Baha'u'llah, and indeed might well be considered a cornerstone of the Baha'i Movement in Egypt. 

 All Baha'is, as a rule, have interesting records as to how the teachings of Baha'u'llah  became the most important thing in life to them, but the story of Muhammad Sa'id carries a specially meaningful note. He lived in Alexandria, and was by profession a teacher in a government school. During  Nawruz (Baha'i New Year) of 1912, he saw 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who had just returned to 

Ramich, (near Alexandria) 

 after his spiritual  mission in the British Isles and Europe. He had never met, or even seen, 'Abdu'l-Baha before this time, but was instantly attracted to Him. Without any plan, in fact almost unconsciously as if moved by a higher power, He followed 'Abdu'l-Baha one day until He reached the Nozha Garden where Baha'is of different nationalities had gathered  for a spiritual meeting and Feast. There Mu~xammad Sa'id witnessed an impressive, inspiring, and, what was to him, an unsurpassed  scene, manifesting amazingly how 'Abdu'l-Baha was revered, the supreme respect  for Him so evident and constant, and a devotion which became an indelible picture which was always with hint There, in that Garden, Muhammad Sa'id received the blessings of 'Abdu'l-Baha as He welcomed him in a voice so powerful, so penetrating, yet spiritually sweet, a voice unlike any other voice, a voice denoting rare spiritual pre-immanence and which called him to the Heavenly Way of the Kingdom. The great privilege of participating in that Feast in the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha inspired this great soui for life. 

 Thereafter he met 'Abdu'l-Baha regularly during all the time He spent in Ramleh 

(19101911). He


<p530>
530            THE BAHA'I   WORLD

  also met Mirza Abu'1-Fadl, one of the renowned  teachers of the Baha'i Cause who was also in Ramleh at that time. 

 Muhammad Sa'id was an earnest seeker after knowledge, and so once he was convinced of the importance of the Baha'i Faith, that it was in truth the religion of the New Age, a Revelation direct from God the Almighty, he diligently studied and prayed until he became well informed and had a remarkably deep understanding of its outer and inner significances. 

 Because of this rich spiritual endowment, and, because of his complete trustworthiness, his innate capacity and his great sincerity and faithfulness  in his Baha'i services, he became a very much honored servant of the Baha'i Cause even long before the establishment of Baha Spiritual Assemblies. 

 Muhammad Sa'id manifested at all times vigor and intensity in his services. 

 He established  in Alexandria (that important city with one of the most magnificent harbors around the Mediterranean) through his service  and sacrifice, a worthy Baha'i Center representative of the Cause. Here the faithful  Muhammad Said and the Baha friends of Alexandria, welcomed Baha'i visitors from the East and from the West on their way to or from the Baha'i Holy Shrines in the Holy Land. 

 One, always manifest, proof of his loyalty to the Cause of Baha'u'llah was his alertness and his ever-watchful attitude in protecting the friends from the peril of doubts and the influence of the enemies of the Cause. 

 His firmness was exemplary, and from his life's story many of the young people of the future  will learn what it means to be a loyal follower of the 

Baha'i Faith.             

 In 1922 the government transferred him to a teaching position in Cairo, Egypt. 

 Here he added many pages to his already distinguished record of loving service to the Ba1A'i Cause. Although-every hour and even every minute outside of his teaching work was given to the Cause, yet he would often take time off from his duties to cooperate heartily in the Arabic translation of the Iqan, the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'1 — Bah&, the Addresses of 'Abdu'l-Baha in Europe and America, as well as many pamphlets and booklets on the Baha'i 

Movement.                 

 Muhammad Sa'id was chairman of both the Local Spiritual Assembly of Cairo, and the 

Baha'i National Spiritual 

 Assembly of Egypt, thus fot several years his responsibilities  were very great, as likewise were his devotion and faithfulness. 

 The Commemoration, in May 1944, of the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the Baha'i Faith, necessarily made additional demands on his time and strength, and they grew increasingly greater as the plans for this historic event matured. By his own noble endeavors, he encouraged all members of committees and others cooperating, — re-suiting in a completely successful and very beautiful termination of this memorable occasion. 

 His brilliant, informative and inspiring  address at the time of the opening of the first session, as well as his almost constant services all through the sessions and thereafter, constitute a notable achievement in his life. 

 In October 1944 he retired from government  service with the thought ever-present in his mind of dedicating his entire life to serving the Cause of Baha'u'llah, but only about a year passed before he was called to serve in that Upper Realm, and his wish, expressed  in his beautiful address at the time of the reinterment of the remains of Mrs. Lua Moore Getsinger in the 

Baha'i Cemetery in Cairo  

 in 1942, and again over the body of Dr. Saich in 1943, that he might at last lie beside them and other loved Baha'is in the Garden of God, was fulfilled     tAnd his reward is great in the

   'ALI-ASGHAR QAZVI Ni      

 187?-July 10th, 1945 'Ali-Asghar was a truly remarkable man judged by any standard. He possessed that rarest of all combinations, a spiritual, pious nature and a sound, discreet, well-balanced mind. He was a native of Qazvin, Persia, and although he modestly disclaimed any right to be considered a learned man, he possessed the greatest of all forms of learning  — a deep knowledge of the sacred texts, both of hUm and the Baha'i 

Faith.                    

 As a young man he earned his living through having the Oriental equivalent of a pharmacy. But he was restless; he wanted

IN MEMORLAM                   531

                'Ali-Asgliar Qazvini

  to really understand the Qur'an; he inquired of the local priests, but was not satisfied by their answers. He decided to buy himself  a stock of nuts and seeds and sell them in the Street to passers by — hoping to con —  tact some human being who could satisfy his intense desire to grasp the meaning of the prophecies of IslAm. 

 One day a Dervish bought some of his wares, he asked him questions, each day a new one; at last the man informed him he was leaving Qazvin. 

 'Au-Asgliar  said he would go with him and be a Dervish too; he left his native town and, as it turned out that the Dervish was a Baha'i, he slowly enlightened him about the new Faith. Finding his wife unresponsive to this new spiritual movement which had set his soui ablaze, he left her and his only child, a son named hlbrThim, and set out in the direction of the Holy Land. For some time he sojourned with the Baha'is of Alex-andretta  and then came to Haifa shortly after the ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 With a heart stirred by grief and fully dedicated to his Faith, he offered himself as a servant to Shoghi Effendi. At that time the Guardian was a young man, stunned by the double blow of his grandfather's death and his own sudden elevation to the lofty position of being His successor. 

 For 25 years the trials and tribulations which inevitably  overtake one occupying so high an office surged about Shoghi Effendi, and for 2 5 years 'Ali-Asgliar was always there, loyal, understanding, ready for any task that might be allotted to him by his overburdened and much loved master. 

 His functions were many: he became lovingly  known as ccM~11i " or £tteacher~~ as he used to instruct, the Baha'i children in the Persian language and writing and in the teachings. 

 His pupils included members of the household, of the community, and young servants in need of instruction. 

 He was the Postman of the Guardian; day after day, year after year, going to and from the 

Post


<p532>

  Office in the heat of summer and the storm of winter, with all the heavy and important correspondence and cables of this World Center. 

 He was the ever-vigilant watchman of the home of the Master, keeping the household accounts, solicitous of its every interest, the friend of every friend of the Guardian, the enemy of every enemy of the Cause. 

     Whatever the Guardian     

 did was sure to find a sound, crystal-clear echo of approval in the heart of the old man who served him with such unique devotion — and such loyalty was not unrewarded: 'Ali-Asghar received many confidences from Shoghi Effendi, was given the most important messages to transmit,  was trusted to a degree that made him the envy of every one, high and 'ow alike. He was greatly esteemed by the pilgrims and admired and respected by the townspeople. 

 It was a touching sight to see him, stooped with age, almost blind with myopia, his hair and beard turning white, going faithfully  about his duties, carrying the heavy brief case of mail back and forth from the Post Office; serving the Guardian's guests tea; bringing the cakes for the Feast Days; even on occasion bent double with the bread for the entire house on his back, during the war days when it was rationed and all the complicated cards were in his trustworthy hands. 

 One would have thought that such constant  service was sufficient of a gift for him to make to the Cause of God; but no, he would go himself, when his health was failing, in spite of every remonstrance, up to the terraces of the Shines and in the heat, with a labourer, render his share of active hard work to the Holy Tombs. 

 He would often turn up with some present for the Guardian, some fresh fruit, something he wished to offer to the House or the Pilgrim House — every thought flowed towards homage  to, and protection of, what he loved best in this world. 

 During the last year of his life, when he was over seventy-five, it became clear that his splendid constitution was being attacked by an incurable disease. 

 It was then, more than ever before, that he tasted the real depths of Shoghi Elfendi's affection for him. 

 Up until the last day of his life the Guardian was as solicitous for the comfort of his servant as the servant had been for 25 years for the comfort of his lord. Foreseeing the rapidly approaching end, and wishing him to catch a glimpse of how great was to be his reward, Shoghi Effendi sent him word that he was cabling the Persian believers about him and referring to him as ccthe lion of the forest of the love of God." The nearest possible  English for this beautiful metaphor in the arabic language is ~ it is a pale tribute beside the original! 

 'A1A~ Asgliar, in hospital, terribly weak and suffering greatly, smiled when he heard this. Then he made his will, having understood that the curtain must be falling on his earthly life. The Centenary review of the Faith in Persian, written by the Guardian, he had had copied out in beautiful long hand; this was to be bound, with his money and given as a gift to Shoghi Effendi; his books were to be given (he had marked each one), to the house as an endowment for the Man's meeting room; all his effects, few as they were, were for the House; he left £40 for the Guardian to dispose of. This was all that lie had after a quarter of a century work! 

 Shoghi Effendi himself annointed the body of his faithful friend and servant; his was the first hand to stretch out to raise his coffin; he sent the flowers of the Shrine for his grave; he cabled 

Persia:                   

 "Distinguished servant, blessed house, lionhearted, steadfast, vigilant, indefatigable  'A1i-A~ghar ascended Abh4 Kingdom. Twenty-five years exemplary, unforgettable service triumphantly ended. His innumerable  services rendered Persian pilgrims merit holding memorial gatherings throughout Persia. 
Inform all believers.     

 'Ir&q friends should likewise honour his memory." 

 Such a man is a worthy example, not oniy for all those who serve the Cause at its World Center to follow, but for every Baha'i. 

 So keenly was this felt by many who came in contact with him that in the end the pilgrims would write to him and sign them6elves "the servant of the servant of the House."

IN MEMORIAM                   533
 
                    Lydia Zamenhof
 
      LYDIA ZAMENHOF             

 "Y~-Bahi'u'1-AbhA' is there any remover of difficulties save God! 
Say, Praise be to God!     

He is God! All are His     

 servants and all abide by His bidding." 

 Such must have been the glad refrain ringing  in the heart and soul of Lydia Zamenhof during her last hours on earth. She must have known that her moment of death was fast approaching. Fervent in her faith and unwavering in her courage, through untold sufferings and persecutions her shining countenance was ever turned towards the eternal goal, until, triumphant and victorious, her spirit winged its flight to its everlasting home. 

 The youngest of three children, Lydia Zamenhof was born in Warsaw, Poland, on January 29, 1904. Her parents were liberal-thinking Jews, and they afforded their son and daughters good educations. Adam became  the outstanding eye specialist of that city; Sofia was a physician; and Lydia received  her LL.M. degree from the 

University of Warsaw.      

 It was inevitable that Lydia Zamenhof should be an idealist. Her father, Dr. Ludwig L. Zamenhof, was the eminent inventor of Esperanto; and her mother, Kiara Zilbernik, was his selfeffacing yet devoted and encouraging  helpmeet. 

 Love for all humanity pervaded the atmosphere of their humble home, and together the parents reared their children in the spirit of world unity and brotherhood. 

 It followed naturally that, when she received her LL.M. degree in 1925, Lydia decided not to practice law, but to devote her time to the spread and teaching of Esperanto. 

 As an authorized instructor of the International Gseh-Institute of Esperanto  at The Hague, she traveled and taught in many countries in Europe. 

 She became the most popular instructor of the Institute, next to Father Andrew Cseh, its founder. In France, where she had spent a


<p534>
534             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  good deal of her time, she was fondly known as 

"The Goddess."             

 In 1913, when Lydia was nine years of age, she attended her first Universal Esperanto  Congress, held in Berne, Switzerland. 

In the "Christian Commonwealth"

 for September  3, 1913, J. M. Warden published an interview with Dr. Zamenhof, who said: C¶j feel greatly interested in the Baha'i movement, as it is one of the great world-move-ments  which, like our own, is insisting upon the brotherhood of mankind, and is calling on men to understand one another and learn to 'ove each other." At another occasion he said, "The personality of 'Abdu'l-Baha and His work I esteem most highly. I see in Him one of the greatest benefactors of the whole human race." 

 This was probably the first contact of Dr. Zamenhof with the Baha'i Faith. 

 It was through Martha Root, the flaming Hand of the Cause of God, that Lydia Za-menhof  came into the fold of Baha'u'llah. This self-sacrificing handmaid of the Blessed Perfection took advantage of every opportunity  to contact the family of Dr. Zamen-hof. 

 Lydia was the oniy one who responded to the call of the Glory of God. 

 In April, 1926, Miss Root was the official representative of the Baha'is at the unveiling of a monument on the grave of Dr. Zamenhof in Warsaw. It was there that Lydia said to her, 'tlt seems to me that Esperanto is only a school in which future Baha'is educate themselves. The Baha'i Movement is a forward  step, it is larger." 

 Several months later, the eighteenth Universal Esperanto Congress was held in Edinburgh,  Scotland. 

On August 2 a Baha'i Esperanto

 Convention was held as part of this Congress. 

 Martha Root, again an official representative of the Baha'i Faith, spoke on ccThe Positive 

Power of Universal Religion." Lydia
Zamenhof was in the audience.

 In the city of Edinburgh, where, in the memorable year 1913, 'Abdu'l-Baha delivered His classic address bef ore the Esperantists, Lydia Zamenhof attended her first Ba1A'i meeting as a believer. 

 Afire with the Message, she set herself to the difficult task of learning the English language in order that she might partake in a fuller measure of the Sacred Writings translated for us by the beloved Guardian. From that time forward her Life was devoted to a twofold purpose — spreading the Message  of Baha'u'llah's, and teaching Esperanto. 

 With the acceptance of the Baha'i Faith, troubles began for Lydia. Branded by some of her relatives as a Thetrayer" of the Jewish religion, she was reviled and persecuted for her belief in the unity of God and the brotherhood of man. So deep-rooted was her love for God, however, that she remained steadfast and firm against all opposition and her fervor and ardor in the Path of Baha'u'llah  increased with the passing of time. 

 God had bountifully endowed Lydia with many talents. 

 Her magnetic charm was unequalled.  She was a born instructor and speaker, and her ability as a translator and writer was unexcelled. Early in her career she rendered into Esperanto the famous work of Sienkewicz, "QUO Vadis?", "Iridiono" by the classic Polish author, Krasinski, and several novels by B. Prus. When she embraced the religion of Baha'u'llah, she dedicated her talents entirely to the Baha'i Cause. Many of her inspiring articles were published in Esperanto and English periodicals with worldwide circulation. 

 Included among her translations are: Baha'u'llah and the New 

Era                        
     Paris Talks by 'Abdu'l-Baha's

     World Religion, by Shoghi

     Baha'i Prayers

  Some Answered Questions    
  KitTh-i-fqTh               

  She also translated into the Polish language t~Bah?u'11Ah and the New Era" and 

"Hidden Words."            

 In 1937, at the request of Shoghi Effendi, the 

National Spiritual Assembly
of the United States and   

Canada invited Lydia       

 Za-menhof  to visit this country. She arrived on September 29, and on October 2 she began  her first Esperanto class in America. With the cooperation of the Esperanto As

 Ann Arbor, Roseville, Marysvilie, and Flint — all in Michigan Chicago, Urbana, and Maywood — all in Illinois 

  Boston                    

 In all, she came in personal touch with about 1500 people during her short stay in the United States. Thus were made many more contacts for the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Through her untiring efforts victory after glorious victory was harvested in His Name. One of the outstanding results of her visit was the undertaking of the Esperanto translation  of ccThe Dawn-Breakers" by an 

American  Baha. Her     

 encouragement and invaluable assistance in this task was a contributing  factor to its successful completion. 

 To live constantly before the public was a sacrifice for Lydia Zamenhof, for she was of a retiring nature, and liked to be alone. Her face in repose bore the expression of sadness which has become a characteristic of the Jewish countenance through centuries of persecution. 

 But when the Name of Baha'u'llah  was mentioned, or of the language of her father's invention, as if through a miracle her whole personality changed. The tiny gnat became a mighty falcon, and she forgot her own self as with shining eyes and vibrant

  voice she launched into discussions or recounted her experiences in her field of service.  Especially did her face become illumined as she told of her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, her precious moments with the Greatest  Holy Leaf, her talks with the beloved Guardian, her communion with God in the Sacred Shrines. 

 On November 28, 1938, Lydia Zamenhof returned to her native land. The outbreak of the war was imminent, and her loving heart yearned to be with her brother and sister in time of hardship. Upon her return to Warsaw she finished the Polish translation of "Baha'u'llah and the New Era." Many of us remember her as she sat on the porch of Green Acre, devoting every spare moment to this work. tShoghi Effendi," she confided, her face aglow, "has told me that I must hurry and finish this as soon as possible." 

 In one of her first letters written after her return to her home, she described how her brother, Dr. Adam Zamenhof, had let her CCconfiscate~~ his typewriter so that she might complete the manuscript, because her own machine did not have 

Polish characters.  To    

 such painstaking work did she devote her entire self. 

 In her last letter to this country, dated August 18, 1939, Lydia Zamenhof wrote, CCNOW there are five Baha'is in Poland, including  myself. Considering the smallness of our numbers, each new soui is all the more important and is accepted with such great joy." She went on to tell of her plans to attend the National 

Esperanto Congress in Lwow 

 early in September, and then to go to the Netherlands for several weeks. Neither the Congress nor the trip ever took place, for Poland was invaded two days after the letter was received. 

 After that, only indirectly could we hear from her, in spite of efforts of the International Red Gross. At first she and her family, together with all

  of the other Jews of Warsaw, were herded into the Ghetto. 

 In 1942, the Zarnenhof family was taken to a concentration camp. Previous to this, all of the professional Jewish men of Warsaw were shot to death. Included among them was her brother, Dr. Adam Zamenhof. In August, 1944, Dr. Sofia Za-menhof  was shot to death. A few days later, exactly eighteen years after she attended  her first Baha'i meeting, Lydia Zamen-hof,  together with many other Jews, was cremated in the Jewish death-camp in Tre-blinka, near Warsaw. This sad news was relayed to the Guardian, who replied by cablegram: (CHeartily approve nationwide observance for dauntless Lydia Zamenhof. Her notable services, tenacity, modesty and unwavering devotion fully merit high tribute from American believers. Do not advise, however, that you designate her a martyr." 

 In a second message, dated April 20, 1946, the Guardian, through his secretary, wrote: ccShe certainly deserves to be remembered by us all for her services to the Faith and her loyalty and devotion! Her death is a great loss, as she was so well able to serve and teach in different languages and different  countries. 

 It seems too terrible to contemplate  what her end must have been!" 

 To the very end of her life Lydia Zamen —  hof remained a heroine, ever thoughtful of the welfare and safety of others. When it became evident that the lives of the inhabitants  of the Ghetto were doomed, the non-Jewish  Esperantists of Warsaw approached her with offers to hide her from the invaders.  She declined, for she wished to remain  with her family. 

 Besides, she said, violent death is the punishment for those who are caught hiding Jews, and she would not think of endangering the lives of her beloved Esperantist friends. 

 So it was that she met her death.

 Prof. George W. Henderson Of her untimely and tragic end Father Andrew Cseh wrote, under date of 

February                   

 7, 1946: "Oh our poor, dear Lydia! 

 According to information received she had a terrible death. How will God ever punish the guilty ones? Their crime truly exceeds every heretofore known measure.~~ When we call to mind the self-sacrifice, the perseverance, the devotion and loving service of Lydia Zamenhof in her zealous and untiring efforts in the Path of God, we can but think of the words revealed by 

Baha'u'llah:                

 "Blessed is he that hath set himself towards Thee, and hasted to attain the DaySpring of the lights of Thy face. Blessed is he who with all his affections hath turned to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Fountainhead of Thine inspiration. 

 Blessed is he that hath expended in Thy path what Thou didst bestow upon him through Thy bounty and favor. Blessed is he who, in his sore longing after Thee, hath cast away all else except Thyself. Blessed is he who hath enjoyed intimate communion with Thee, and rid himself of all attachment to any one save Thee."

 The length of 'Abdu'l-Baha's ministry  as Center of the Covenant was twenty-nine years. George Henderson's Baha'i life, at a different time, covered exactly the same length. At the Master's funeral no Baha'i spoke, making way for non-Bah&i orators of various faiths, Christian, Jewish, and Moslem, all so eager to pay their tributes of veneration to their beloved teacher and the "Father of the Poor." The only Baha'i speaker at the obsequies of His devoted fol

  lower was Limited to a few minutes because of a similar condition. 

     Months before, George     

 was aware of his proximate end, remarking that he had much work but little time, as he would not outlive the year. He proceeded to set his house in order. 

 He incorporated his school so that its services might survive him. He also provided that, agreeable to the wishes of the Baha'is, it might always be used by them. 

 Despite stormy weather the funeral assembled a capacity audience. 

 There were prayers for the departed. Remarks touching his success as educational pioneer and in discovering  Baha'u'llah, whose Glory now encircles the earth, were feelingly given. His bold proclamation of faith; his humble and grateful acknowledgment of it as the foundation and motivating power of his life's work received mention. 

 There followed an array of distinguished speakers from the clergy, the field of education,  religious and secular, the officialdom of his native state. Most impressive of these was that of a venerable clergyman of the white race who left a sick bed to attend, exposing  himself to further perils through taxi shortage on a stormy day. With tear dimmed eyes and faltering voice, he pictured his great love for his brother; how they had spent long hours together meditating and conversing about the mysteries of the divine worlds. His former Sunday school teacher told of the bright promise of his youth. The dean related his connections with faculty and students. 

 A state official, described the esteem  of Tennessee, also how he fQund him an ideal companion. Another clergyman suspended a rule of his church to eulogize George Henderson. 

 The pastor of the church which he often attended brilliantly portrayed him as a planter, builder, writer, and father, in all of which he was par excellent. 

 The aroma of flowers, the spiritual atmosphere, the fine opportunity to teach the oneness of humanity to an interracial gathering,  Tennyson's beautiful poem, "Crossing the Bar," added ~oy to solemnity. 

 This tribute has come from Haifa: "He (the Guardian) was sorry to hear Prof. Henderson had passed away. No doubt he will now find himself in that happy state promised by the Beloved as the reward of His faithful servants. The Guardian will pray for his spiritual advancement and that his deeds in the South may bear fruit."

 Leafing through the pages of some of John's Baha'i books, we found these words underlined, and realized anew how much these particular teachings possessed and controlled  his thinking — "the preservation of His Law, the safeguarding of His 

Cause."                   

 We, here in Lima, PerA, knew John Stearns during one year of terrible suffering, and yet the things we remember most are: his fortitude; his patient endurance; his smiling answers to our solicitous questions about his health, CcI~m feeling fine," or when the pain was worse, "So-so"; his brave humor — calling the radium needles in his tongue his phonograph needles. His oniy impatience was when he thought we were doing too much for him. 

 We all wished we could do much more.

 He was acquitted once during this period but the enemies of the Cause exerted every effort until they succeeded in putting him again under chains. 

 When he was set at liberty he emigrated to Quetta in Baluchist4n in obedience to the instructions of the Guardian to the general body of the friends in Persia. 

 In conjunction with other Baha'is of Quetta he succeeded in establishing an Assembly in that centre in the year 100 of the Baha'i Era and in purchasing a building to serve as the local Ua;iratu'l.-Quds.  He died at Quetta of heart failure on the 27th May, 1944 and was buried there.

  The connection of Mabry C. Oglesby with the Faith, goes back to 1913 when he and his wife heard the Baha'i Message and shortly thereafter accepted it. They studied under the tutelage of Mr. and Mrs. Harlan F. Ober, and during the annual convention of 1917 held in Boston, received a great confirmation. 

 Mr. Oglesby was an able and active advocate  of the Faith. In his life, he sincerely endeavored to express the Baha'i principles. He was greatly loved by the more than ten thousand members of the national labor organization to which he belonged. 

 For about fifteen years he was one of the national representatives  of his coworkers in conference with the management of the company regarding  wages and working conditions. 

 His insight, courage and fairness made him outstanding. 

 His influence both in the Baha'i Cause and in his daily work, was for unity and peace. Through his position he bad the opportunity of meeting many people of all walks of life. 

 He was kind to all and forth

  right in his statements and was continually engaged in offering the Baha'i 

Message.                   

 Although he was unable to take so long a journey, Mr. Oglesby sent his wife and daughter to visit the Sacred Shrines on Mt. Carmel. They were the third and fourth among the Ba1x~'is of the colored race to make such a journey from the West, and enjoyed the privilege of meeting the Guardian, as the two former visitors had met 'Abdu'l-Baha.  The devotion and sacrifice of this pilgrimage,  as is true of all such sacrifices, were the means of releasing great spiritual forces which strengthened the bond of race unity, a phase of the teaching work in which they were most active. 

 One of the brightest memories of his life was a motor trip, in which he was accompanied  by Mrs. Oglesby and two of his white Baha'i friends, to attend the 

Convention  in Wilmette.  

 Social gatherings and meetings for the promulgation of the Faith were arranged in many cities both on the iQurney to Wilmette and on their return to Boston. 

 Mr. Oglesby was for nearly fourteen years a member of the Spiritual Assembly of Boston,  Massachusetts. 

 In this capacity, and also as a delegate to the Baha'i National Conventions, his services were always constructive,  always touching the heights of reality. 

 From his first confirmation, he became aware of the tremendous spiritual power in the Baha'i Cause and he dedicated himself to its service. Through his devotion he became eloquent, and his radiant face and impassioned  utterances will long be remembered. 

 Memorial services were held in Boston after his death on May 19, 1945. 

 The tributes paid to him by his associates were most illuminating  and revealed the esteem in which he was held. The hearts of many who were present were attracted by the inspiring IBahA'i service. 

 During the winter of his life he was beset with many illnesses, losses, and afflictions of various kinds. Neither he nor his wife ever wavered in the face of annoying persecutions and trials, but attained the bounty of divine protection. 

 There are many who will miss him in this world; more will welcome him on the Shining Shore.

After attending his classes she was convinced that Baha'u'llah was the ttSon of Man" and the tCL rd of the Vineyard" promised by Jesus Christ, and the "Everlasting Father," the ccPrince of Peace" promised by Isaiah to come in the "latter days." She not only accepted the Baha'i Message, but wanted others to hear the glad-tidings of the fulfillment of that great Event. 

 Regarding the finding and delivery of the dedication stone: according to her nurse* for three and a half years before her departure, Mrs. ToWn mentioned the following: One day while sitting alone and busy with dressmaking in the home of one of the believers,  she heard a voice questioning, "Do you believe in immortality?" 
She replied, ttYes I do."  

 The voice said, "Then, get a stone." A few days later the voice again came, but louder than before, CCDO you believe  in immortality?" 

 Again she replied, ttYes I do." And the voice said, "Get a stone." 

 Mrs. Tobin delayed carrying out the request.  Again the voice came a third time and commanded her to obtain a stone. She began looking around and was inspired to go to a place where a building was under construction.  Here the contractor, after hearing  her request, told her to select any stone that she wanted. 

 She chose a very large one and started away with it in a small hand-drawn express wagon. About half way to the Temple site, the wagon collapsed, but a kindly milkman helped her carry the stone to the foot of the hilt on which the House of ~     tt7~gfr8 Tobin told me of the incidents mentioned and added that when 'Abdu'l-Baha arrived in Chicago she presented Him with a bouquet of white roses and some grapefruit. He requested one of His attendants to save the seed from the latter to be planted at His borne in Haifa. She also contributed for the Shrine of the Thib on Mt. Carmel. 'Abdu'l-Baha promised that Mrs. Tobin, with her whole family would be blessed." — Gertrude Triebwasser, nurse to Mrs. Tobin during her long illness. 

 Worship now stands. Two boys assisted in getting the stone to the top of the, bill. 

 When 'Abdu'l-Baha visited the Temple site in 1912, to dedicate the grounds, He saw this stone, and when a hole had been dug by representatives of many nations, He had it placed therein, and it became the object around which the ceremony of dedication of the Temple site revolved. 

 During the years following that Event and the building of the Temple, the stone was carefully preserved, and finally imbedded in the cement floor of the basement at the spot where 'Abdu'l-Baha dedicated it. As one visits that sacred place and gazes at the unpolished, rough piece of natural rock and remembers its significance coupled with the greatness of the One Who blessed it by His Word and Presence, one gratefully recalls the faith and effort of the humble soul inspired to bring it there for that unique and remarkable occasion.

     Miss Mary Lesch of Chicago 

 will ever be remembered for her service to the Baha'i Faith, especially in the vital task of publishing  and distributing the literature of the Cause, during the years from 1910 to 1922, in America. 

 This was a service without remuneration  rendered outside the time spent in earning a livelihood. 

 In the early days of the Faith, this service was freely given by Mr. and Mrs. Agnew, until ill health made it impossible for them to continue. 

 Miss Lesch graciously shouldered the labor it involved, and continued until the National Spiritual Assembly relieved her by creating a Committee to handle the ever-increasing responsibility and labor. 

 In 1911, the Star of the West advertised twenty-six publications of the Faith. 

 Some tine later an edition of The Baha'i Proofs, by Mirza Abu'I-Fa~ll, and an American edition  of Some Answered Questions, were added to the list handled by Miss Lesch. 

 By the year 1919 her capable management had accumulated enough funds to undertake the publication of the Addresses of 'Abdu'l-Baha, delivered in America in 1912.

IN MEMORIAM                   545

                     Mary Lesch

  hundred pages was entrusted by 'Abdu'l-Baha  to Howard MacNutt of Brooklyn, and printing and binding was done by the undersigned. 

 During the period of production word was received from 'Abdu'l-Baha to name the compilation The Promulgation of Universal Peace. This was a fitting climax to a decade and more of service to the Faith, and a splendid memorial to her who rendered it. Mary Lesch was the sister of George Lesch, one of the beloved early believers, and Secretary  of the 

House of Spirituality      

 in Chicago,  who died in 1918. In a Tablet to Miss Lesch, 'Abdu'l-Baha wrote: "Do not grieve for thy dear brcther who has ascended from this mortal world to the eternal realm. 

 That drop has hastened to the limitless ocean and that wandering bird has flown to the shelter and nest of the Supreme Concourse. Thou shalt find him at the effulgent gathering  in the Kingdom of Mysteries." 

 In response to a message reporting the passing of Mary Lesch on March 24, 1945, the Guardian cabled as follows: ttDeeply grieve passing of indefatigable, staunch pioneer  of the Faith in the Day of the Covenant.  The record of her services imperishable, her reward great in the 

AbM Kingdom."             

 May her spirit rejoice forevermore within the 

Eternal Realm!

              NOTES ON THE PRONUNCIATION
                   OF PERSIAN WORDS

  The emphasis in Persian words is more or less evenly distributed, each syllable being equally stressed as in French. 

 Far example, do not say Tabriz or Tabarsi; stay as long on one syllable as on the next: Tabriz; Ta-bar-si.  (While there are many exceptions to this rule, it is the most generally correct method of treating the question of stress.) 

 A frequent mistake is the failure to distinguish between broad and flat tta~s.~~ This differentiation makes the language especially musical and should be observed: in the word AfnAn, for example, pronounce the first tta~~ as in mat, and the second syllable to rhyme with on. Americans are apt to pronounce short ~ plus C!~~ like the verb form are; this is a mistake; !!~5 should be pronounced as in the name of Harry — cf. Tarbiyat. 

 The same differentiation should be observed  in the case of long and short "i" and long and short "u." As the guide to the transliteration indicates, short "i" is like ece~~ in best, and long "i" like "ce" in meet; for example, IbrThim is pronounced 

Eb-ri

  hem; Is1~m is Ess — lahm. 

 Short "u" being like in short, and long "u~9 being like in moon, the following would be pronounced: Quddiis — Qod-dooss; BArfunish —  BAr — fo-roosh. 

 Pronounce "aw" to rhyme with oh, or mown; NAWRUZ is No-Rooz. 

 The following consonants may be pronounced  like v dh z z d. The following consonants may be pronounced  like ss th s s Zb is pronounced like the "s" in pleasure. jjj~ is pronounced like ttch" in Scotch loch or German nachi. Do not pronounce it as ~     Westerners are as a rule incapable of pronouncing gfi and 'tq"; a guttural French "r" will serve here; otherwise use hard •'g" as in good. 

 H and $, approximately like the English aspirate "h," should never be dropped. 

 Tihr~n is Teh-ron; madrisih is mad — res-seh; Mibrib is Meh-rob. 

 In the case of double letters pronounce each separately: 'Abbas. 

 The character transliterated (') represents a pause; it is not unlike the initial sound made in pronouncing such a word as every. The word Baha'i is phonetically as follows: a as in account; a as in father; (9, pause; "i" as ee in meet. 

 The character transliterated (') may also be treated as a pause. 

 N.E. As Persian often indicates no vowel sounds and as its pronunciation differs in different localities throughout Persia and the Near East as well as among individuals in any given locality, a uniform system of transliteration such as the above, which is in use by Baha'i communities all over the world, is indispensable to the student.

          SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE OPENING

  THE BAHA'I CENTENARY EXHIBITION, 

                        OF
               LONDON, MAY 20th 1944

  B~ SIR RONALD STORKS, K.C.M.G., L.L.D., L.G.C. IT is a high honour for an Anglican Englishman to have been chosen to open the Centenary of a non-Christian — though far from antiChristian — world Faith. I can claim but three qualifications. 

 I am an M.A. of the same university as Edward Browne of Cambridge and a scholar of the same college,  Pembroke. Edward Browne was not oniy the finest Persian scholar of the age but the best loved foreigner in lr~n and throughout  the Baha'i world; secondly, I had the honour of 'Abbas Effendi's friendship from 1909 until his death; thirdly, I am the latest from that front — of Haifa, 'Akka, Eaghd~d, Tihr&n, Ispahan and $hir&z. Of this — if you will bear with me — later. 

 Many of my hearers are already believers, initiates, adept; it is not my intention to give information to those that know, but for those interested rather than acquainted, I shall propound a very brief summary of the origin, development and principles of what is now known as the Baha'i religion. 

 Why is 1944 the "Centenary" of this Faith? Because 100 years ago, all but two days, a young merchant of Shir~z, Sayyid 'Au-Muhammad, not yet 25 years old, declared,  to one follower, that he was the bearer of a new message to mankind. 

 He described himself as the ]3~b — one of the many Arabic words adopted by the Persian language —  meaning gate, or door, of this dispensation. His followers soon multiplied, but he spent most of his life in captivity, until in 1850 he was condemned, like Christ, Socrates and other religious innovators, to death. His execution was marked by a startling portent, which is thus recorded in a contemporary Persian "Traveller's 

Narrative":               

 UAn iron nail was hammered into the middle of the staircase of the very cell wherein  they were imprisoned, and two ropes were hung down. By one rope the Mb was suspended and by the other rope Ak~ Muhammad  'Au, both being firmly bound in such wise that the head of that young man was on the Mb's breast. The surrounding housetops billowed with teeming crowds. A regiment  of soldiers ranged itself in three files. The first file fired; then the second file, and then the third file discharged volleys. From the fire of these volleys a mighty smoke was produced. When the smoke cleared away they saw that young man standing and the Mb seated by the side of his amanuensis Ak& Sayyid Ijusayn in the very cell from the staircase of which they had suspended them. 

 The bullets had merely cut their thongs. To neither one of them had the slightest iniury resulted. 

 "Akka JAn Beg of Khamsa, colonel of the bodyguard, advanced; and they again bound the Bab, together with that young man, to the same nail. The BTh uttered certain words which those few who knew Persian understood,  while the rest heard but the sound of his voice. The colonel of the regiment appeared in person. Suddenly he gave orders to fire. At this volley the bullets produced such an effect that the breasts (of the victims)  were riddled, and their limbs, but not their faces, which were but little marred."

646            THE BAHA'I WORLD

  For more than a decade B~bists were persecuted, prosecuted, executed, until it seemed as if the Belief must perish, through the extermination of all believers. But in April, 1863, Baha'u'llah, a nobleman of Persia, who had fervently championed the Faith of the Bib, and who had undergone imprisonment and exile, declared at BaghdAd that He was that same great Educator whose coming the E~b had foretold. From Eaghd&d he disappeared into a mountain retreat: for although  crconversation enriches the understanding, solitude is the school of genius. He was, as a schismatic, removed by the Ottoman authorities to Istanbul, to Edirneb (Adrianople) and finally to the penal barracks  of the ancient and picturesque Palestine port of 'Akka — known by its Phoe-rncian  builders as Accho, and by the Crusaders as St. Jean d'Acre, where he died in 1892. Baha'u'llah so developed and extended the original B~bist faith, that be was regarded  as its second Founder; and believers took from him their present universal name of Baha'is. This is what Edward ]3rowne wrote, after his visit to Baha'u'llah in 1890: ~ found myself in a large apartment, along the upper end of which ran a iow divan. 

 A second or two elapsed ere, with a throb of wonder and awe, I became definitely conscious that the room was not untenanted. In the corner where the divan met the wall, sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt headdress of the kind called t&j by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jetblack hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and iove which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain. 

 Baha'u'llah appointed his eldest son 'Abdu'l-Baha — 'tSlave of the Glory" (born in Tihr~n a few hours after the Mb's original proclamation) as his successor. He preferred to be called by his second name, 'Abbas Effendi; and is remembered by Baha'is as "The Master." 'Abbas Effendi remained a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire until 1908 when the Young Turks changed the r6gime and set free all the political and religious prisoners of the Sulv~n. In the meantime the Faith of Baha'u'llah bad reached the Western World. In Europe and America there were groups of devoted and zealous followers spreading the message. 

 'Abbas Effendi  after his release went to Egypt, and in 1911 visited Europe. 
He was in London in September.

 Next in April, 1912, he set out on a tour of the United States and went through that vast country from coast to coast. December of that year saw him again in London. The following year he was on the Continent. 

 He thus brought Bahi'iism dramatically before the Western World. Soon after his return to the Holy Land, the world plunged into war. During the war years 'Abbas Effendi strove hard to relieve distress and for this a Knighthood of the British Empire was conferred upon him by His 

Majesty's Government.      

 He passed away on November 28th, 1921, mourned by peo-pie  of all races, religions and classes. On his death in 1921 he was succeeded by Shoghi Effendi, educated at Balliol College, Oxford, the present Guardian of the Faith, who resides at Haifa, the centre of world Bah&iism. 

 What is "the Faith"? Very broadly, the application of Relativity to Religion. 

 Divine Revelation is continuous and progressive, with the development of the human race; the thesis indeed of Christianity, relative to Judaism: "religious truth is not absolute, but relative; that the Founders of all past religions, though different in the non-essen-tial aspects of their teachings 'abide in the same Tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, utter the same speech and proclaim the same IFaith.' 

 The Baha'i year is divided into 19 months of 19 days, with four intercalary days for ordinary years and live for Leap Year. 

 The first day of each month is observed as a feast, dedicated successively to spiritual, practical and social affairs. 

 There is no priesthood in Bah?iism. Observance depends entirely upon the degree

  of devotion of each individual believer. As 'Abbas Effendi said; "Behold a candle, how it iltumines; it weeps its life away drop by drop, in order to give its flame of light." But I have myself seen their great temple at Wilmette, near Chicago. The architect was a French Canadian: a happy symbolic union of the mighty Latin and AngloSaxon civilizations. 

 The total number of world Baha'is is estimated at some two millions, of which about eight thousand are in the United States. 

 In Persia itself there are nearly a million; no longer persecuted but not yet accepted or recognized with the four official religions: Iskm, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism, because Isl&m only recognizes the last three. There are some 800 Local Spiritual Assemblies scattered mainly over the 'Western World. All of these are enriched by such Baha'i institutions as Summer  Schools. Ladies and gentlemen will learn without surprise that in 1937 Germany suppressed all summer schools and the whole Baha'i organization, and confiscated their archives. 

 May I add, before concluding, some personal  details? 

 My first connection with BahA'iism dates from the beginning of this century, when it was my fortune and honour to become the Arabic pupil of Edward Browne. 

 My first glimpse of 'Abbas Effendi was the summer of 1909, when I drove round the Bay of Acre in an Arab cab, visited him in the Barracks and marvelled at his serenity and cheerfulness after 42 years of exile and imprisonment. 

 I kept in touch with him through my confidential Agent, Husain Bey Ruhi, son of a Tabriz martyr, and the (cpersian Mystic" of my book Orientaflons. 

 After the Young Turk revolution, 'Abbas Effendi was released. 

 He visited Egypt in 1913, when I had the honour of looking after him, and of presenting him to Lord Kitchen-Cr,  who was deeply impressed by his personality  — as who could fail to be? 

 Then war cut him off from us and it might have gone hard with him in Haifa but for the indirect interposition of His Majesty's Government. 

 When, in his famous victory drive to the North, Allenby captured Haifa, he detached i-ne from Jerusalem to organize the British Administration there. 

 On the evening of my arrival I visited my revered friend. ttj found him sitting in spotless white. 

 He placed at my disposal the training and talents of his community, and I appointed one or two to positions of trust, which they still continue to deserve." Later, he visited me in Jerusalem,  and was held in great esteem and respect by the High Commissioner, Lord Samuel. 

 In Egypt he presented me with a beautiful specimen of writing by the celebrated Baha'i calligraphist, Misliqin Qalam, and with his own Persian pen box; in Palestine  with an exquisite little Bokhara rug from the tomb of the Mb; all three alas destroyed by fire in Cyprus. When, on November  29th, 1921, he was buried, 10,000 men, women and children, of many varying races and creeds, walked in the funeral procession  up Mount Carmel, to lay his body in the exquisite cypress-avenued shrine. 

     Telegrams reached Haifa    
from all over the world.   

 Mr. Winston Churchill, then Secretary of the State for the Colonies, desired  the High Commissioner for Palestine to convey to the Baha'i Community on behalf  of His Majesty's Government their sympathy and condolence on the death of Sir 'Abdu'l-Baha 'Abbas K.B.E.; and Field Marshal Lord Allenby telegraphed likewise from Egypt. 
  With 'Abbas Effendi the    

Apostolic and Heroic Age   

 of Bah& 'jism is considered to be ended. 

 I have not lost contact with the Baha'i World, and I hope I never shall. 

 I had recently the honour of receiving at the British Legation in TibrAn, a deputation of the Baha'i Community headed by Samimi, the respected Chief Munshi of the Legation, and Varga, President of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Persia. 

 Later I was received by the Council at a tea — so sumptuous that the remembrance adds a sting to my British Ration Card. My diary of April 5th, 1943, at $hir~z tells me: t'Aft luncheon off to visit the House of the BTh, leaving the car for the narrow winding streets, and shown over by Fazlullah BenTh and the curator.

      THE ASSURANCE OF WORLD PEACE

  THE EVOLUTION OF PEACE     
                           
       Horace Holley              

  THE first of what people of today would call a ccpeace society" was not founded until 1 8 15; nevertheless the principle of peace, under different names and forms, has always been men's first concern. Unity is the condition  of human survival. 

 Thus it is possible to see the working out of the peace principle in these various manifestations of the capacity to survive: a.     The development of the stabilized f am-ily  unit, bringing peace to the individual man and woman, and security to the child; b.     The formation of clans and tribes, elim —  mating inter-family disputes; c.     The rise of the historic peoples — the Chinese, the Jewish, Persian, etc., when peace was maintained in one area previously held by separate and competitive clans, tribes and city-states, often with religious sanction and meaning, as in the case of the Amphi-trionic  Council uniting Greek cities in 1497 B.C.; d.     The Roman Empire, the type of peace imposed by a central authority after conquest and forceful assimilation into one political system; e.     The Swiss Confederation, 1393 AD., and the American Federal Government, 1787, signalizing the attainment of peace by a number of independent sovereignties through voluntary agreement. 

 Even a cursory survey of history reveals the fact that CCpeace~~ has worn many garbs and spoken many tongues, but whether weak or strong in one case, or local or widespread in another, or voluntary or involuntary in a third, or predominantly political or religious, it has involved at least that minimum degree of unity and cooperation required for the maintenance of human life under any and all conditions. No doubt a clearer insight  into the realm of social value would reveal to us the fact that some of the most vital victories of peace were won in days before the word had attained general significance. 

 Just as the political complexion of peace has been diverse, so has its religious meaning or connection. 

 a.     Judaism sought peace among tribes through devotion to their common race and their common Prophet and Lawgiver. 

 Ii.     In one of its branches Christianity makes peace a matter of doctrinal uniformity  under one ecclesiastical authority; in another branch it has produced the dissenting sects in some of which the individual has claimed peace for himself as a loyalty to Christ divorced from social responsibility; in others of which peace has been both a moral and a social ideal to be worked out through reforms of the political and economic institutions. 

 c.     IsI&m, to a degree not generally realized by western peoples, combined religious and civil authority in a new type of society in which different tribes and sects might find peace under law. Isl4m did not convert by the sword. The followers of Moses and of Christ could retain their faiths provided they


<p650>

  participated in the new and larger ethical domain embraced in IsL4m. They were offered  terms of a treaty. When they broke th~ treaty they were attacked if necessary by the military power. 

 In Europe by the sixteenth century the uniformity of Christendom attained by extension  of the Roman empire through the post-empire church body had been replaced by the diversity of the modern nations. 

 The peace effort took on the form of internationalism, the union of the different equal sovereigaties represented by secular kings. 

 During that period we note the following manifestations of peace: a. Henry IV of France in 1603 put forth a ttGreat Design" of federal relationships among sovereign states with a representative international body for Europe. 

     A'. In 1694 William Penn   
published his CfPlan for   

Permanent Peace" in Europe.

 c. The philosophy of federalism was expressed  by Emmanuel Kant in 1795 in his work on c~Perpetua1 Peace." 

 In Baha'is "History of Peace," an admirable text dealing with the subject up to about the year 1930, we find emphasis laid upon the fact that the French and American revolutions transformed the nature of the state, identifying it with the peopie instead of with the dynasty, and this transformation of society broadened the concept of peace from political agreement among a few leaders to that of effective human relations among masses of citizens. 

 With the termination of the Napoleonic wars begins the modern phase of the evolution  of peace. This event marks, broadly speaking, the demarcation between the two social eras of agriculture-trade economy and manufacture-trade economy. The religious spirit likewise deepened and intensified, and combined with the spirit of internationalism in effort to prevent economic as well as military conflict. 

 During the nineteenth century the peace movements undertook measures for popular education, to arouse the masses to the pitch of crusade, and gradually formulated a program  urged upon the national governments to carry out, embracing five points: a. Arbitration of disputes b. International court c. Code of international law d. International legislation e. Disarmament The force of public opinion and the weight of organized effort seemed to come to fruitage  with the Czar's call of the first Hague Conference in 1899. 

 Opinion, idealism and reason could thenceforth express themselves through public policy and an enhanced degree  of government responsibility. However, the two Hague Conferences produced the means for arbitrating minor disputes but could not impinge upon the sacred realms of national honor and national interest and hence were unable to produce any new social organism capable of maintaining international peace. Fifteen years after the first Hague Conference, 1914, the outer crash of civilization began, revealing its fundamental lack of spiritual integrity and moral force. Even the terrible fury and destructiveness of that first "world war" could not stay the fatal trend. 

The League of Nations      

 created an unparalleled opportunity for consultation on international problems, conditions and trends, but the opportunity was employed as a means of postponing the fundamental decision and nor as the means of making and carrying it out. 

 What emerges from study of the evolution of peace is that history reveals the existence of a true criterion for judging the sincerity of the peace effort put forth at any given time. If the peoples, groups or sovereignties concerned create a new and larger organism vested with sovereignty over all its constituent parts, the work done is peace. If, however, the participating units (whether nations,  churches, business firms and labor unions) each insists upon retaining its own independent sovereignty, and together the units create no new and inclusive body, then the work done may be called wonderful but it is not peace. Treaties, agreements and charters have been made but to be broken, for they are the temporary adjustment of an organism that seeks its own preservation above all things. The union of the nations in one order, a world order and a superstate — this is the ultimate goal of man's evolution  of peace.

LESSER PEACE              
                          
    George Orr Lathner        

  The concept of a federated world was unfolded by Baha'u'llah more than seventy-five  years ago in a series of Epistles addressed to the kings and rulers of the world. 

 At that time He pointed out that the sovereign remedy for the healing of the world's ills was the union of all its nations and peoples in one universal Cause, in the Tablets to Queen Victoria the heads of government were admonished to disarm, save in a measure  to protect and safeguard their territories; representative government was praised and collective force was to be imposed against any nation by all the others if such a nation took up arms against another. 

 Napoleon III was advised that "the sword of wisdom is sharper than the sword of steel," and Czar Alexander II of Russia was directed: "arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling Cause and summon, then, the nations unto God." 

 These messages to the rulers appealed for the application of the highest principles governing human as well as international relations. 

 History records the fact that these appeals for the establishment of some form of a world State were rejected by the crowned heads and the resultant chaos produced two world wars within a period of twenty-five years. 

 The world today has been given its second opportunity to establish peace by political  action on the part of the sovereign nations. 

 A number of plans have been proposed  for world control within recent years, the latest of which is the United Nations World Organization Plan outlined at Dum-barton  Oaks with its two divisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, which will be considered at the present international peace congress at San 

Francisco. *              

 Any plan for world security based upon a continuation of military alliances resulting from the present world conflict is doomed to failure, for as Mr. Sumner Welles has pointed out in his recent book, The Time for Decision,  history proves these alliances have lasted but a few years and nations will not be reconciled to being dominated indefinitely The United Nations Conference, April 25 to June 26, 1945.

  by a dictatorship of a few Great Powers. The building of a permanent world peace must be based upon recognition of the moral and spiritual rights of all peoples and nations; it is not sufficient just to establish the mechanics for stopping quarrels between nations. 

 In order to build the ttL Peace" the limited idea of sovereignty as expressed by the proponents of nationalism will have to undergo a revision. 

The eminent Chief Justice  

 Jay defined sovereignty as the "right to govern." 

 This right is not merely an arbitrary one, but arises out of the nature of any relationship to which it is applied. There can be local, national and international sovereign power at the same time. 

 Nations may be unequal in power and influence and impotent in isolation, but they should be equal before the law. A nation does not give up its sovereign power when it enters a world organization. 
On this point the Senior Judge,

United States Circuit      
Court of Appeals,  Tenth  
Circuit, Honorable One     

 L. Phillips  amplifies this very important theme in the following statement: cdt is an act of sovereignty, not a surrender thereof, to engage  in war. It is an act of sovereignty, not a surrender thereof, to enter into an international arrangement to provide a substitute of peaceful processes for war, to create a world order based on law and justice as a substitute for world anarchy. It is a question of how we shall exercise, not a surrender of, our sovereignty if we face the facts and view the alternatives objectively." 

("The Proposed International
Organization for Peace     
and Law," January 1945.)   

 The narrow  principle of absolute national sovereignty  is outmoded as the nations move forward to establish a world order, for the voice and will of the people must find expression  at the council table, to insure their future peace and security. This view has been ably expressed by the 

Honorable Harold E. Stassen

 in a recent article on t~The Cost of Lasting 

Peace" (Colliers, April    

 21, 1945) wherein he writes: ccTht we hold that true sovereignty rests in the people, and that there is and must be a law of humanity above and beyond the narrow rule of nationalistic absolute  sovereignty. 

 That man is in truth and in fact endowed, not by his nation, but by his Creator with certain inalienable rights." In the Baha'i plan for a new World Order, the word "security" implies both a state of mind and a state of affairs. All previous attempts to lay a foundation for lasting peace have failed to recognize the underlying moral principle, a unity of conscience that blazes from the fire of a vital living faith. This security must be vouchsafed to all individuals,  communities and natioAs alike. "The plans of religious leaders," writes Professor Otto Tod Mallery, "to spiritualize the inner man are as essential to any plan as mortar is to bricks." 'Abdu'l-Baha emphasized this all important principle in a letter to a distinguished  minister and classmate of the former President Woodrow Wilson, written at the time the delegates were gathered at the socalled peace chamber at Versailles in 1919, by stating: ~U \'ersal Peace will not be brought about through human power and shall not shine in full splendor unless this weighty and important matter be realized through the Word of God." 

 The Plan given to the rulers of the world by Baha'u'llah calls for a world parliament composed of elected representatives of the people with an International Executive strong enough to enforce the compact entered  into by the signatory nations. 

 By general agreement the nations will gradually disarm, retaining only sufficient arms to preserve  internal order. However, these governments  will contribute a proportionate share of their army and navy toward the formation of an international police force. Each nation will surrender its claims to make war, as well as the right to impose certain taxes, to this supreme commonwealth. The national assemblies of each country will elect the choicest men of its country who are well informed concerning international law and the relationships between governments, men who are aware of the essential social and economic needs of humanity. The number of representatives are in proportion to the population of each country. Their election  is to be confirmed by the congress or parliament of each nation. 'The members of the Supreme Tribunal will be chosen from these delegates so that the will of the people wiii be fully expressed at the council table

  and when a decision is arrived at, either unanimously or by majority-rule, there will be no longer any pretext for objection as both the plaintiff and defendant are properly represented by their duly accredited representatives. 

 On March 26th, 1945, as the representatives  of the nations and peoples of the world were turning their attention to the coming Peace Conference at San Francisco, the 

National  Baha'i Assembly 

 sent a telegram to the President of the United States quoting 'Abdu'l-Baha's statement on the destiny of the American democracy to establish the foundation of international agreement and expressing the prayerful hope of the American Baha'is that the creation of a new world order would appear at the forthcoming conference  under his leadership. The following reply from the Department of State, dated April 17, 1945 has just been received: CCI acknowledge the receipt, by reference from the White House, of your telegram of March 26, 1945, on behalf of the American Baha'is, in which you express the tprayerful hope' that the President tWill be spiritually guided and reinforced to lead the nations and peoples of the world in the inauguration of universal peace.' 

 t~The Department of State shares with the American Baha'is the hope that universal peace may be inaugurated at the conclusion of this war. As you are doubtless aware, it is the policy of this Government to establish an international organization for peace and security. The attainment of this objective will require the sustained support of an active and informed public opinion, and for this reason, it is heartening to know of the active interest of the American Baha'is in the problems of peace and security. 

 "As of interest to you and your associates, I am enclosing some recenily released material  on the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. 

 I believe you will be especially interested in the speech by Mr. Henry S. Villard, entitled tThe Positive Approach to an Enduring Peace.' 

 "You are assured that the views contained in your telegram have been carefully examined  by the appropriate officers of the Department  of State, and your courtesy in making them available is very much appreciated. 

 ~~ Sincerely yours, "For the Secretary of State; Francis H. Russel, 

Chief                      
Division of Public Liaison"

  Mr. Herbert Hoover recently pointed out that the great principles of political rights of nations and men are absent in the proposals  of the Dumbarton Oaks conference and he warns of the danger of setting up tta purely mechanistic body without spiritual inspiration or soui." It is to be hoped that the delegates to the fojthcoming United Nations Peace Congress will ity the foundation  for a world order on a basis of the noblest principles that have yet animated the minds and hearts of mankind. 

 The fate of the previous effort after the last world war should stand as a guide post for charting the path of the new order away from the shifting sands of national and personal ambitions.  Shoghi Effendi has pictured the former failure in these poignant words: "The ideals that fired the imagination of America's tragically unappreciated President, whose high endeavors, however much -nulli-  fied by a visionless generation, 'Abdu'l-Baha through His own pen, acclaimed as signalizing  the dawn of the Most Great Peace, though now lying in the dust, bitterly reproach  a heedless generation for having so cruelly abandoned them." 

 World peace and world organization are not impracticable. 

 There is a great power latent in human endeavor which is guided by the power of the Word, but an indomitable determination and ceaseless vigilance and endeavor are required to achieve this goal. When the political foundations for the "Lesser Peace" are firmly established so that war, as a means of settling disputes, is disbarred  forever, then humanity may look forward to the day of the CeMOSt Great Peace," promised by Baha'u'llah, — the ultimate achievement of the organic and spiritual  unity of the entire human race.

  day there is no more important matter in the world than that of Universal Peace but unity of conscience is essential, so that the foundation of this matter may become secure, its establishment firm and its edifice strong. 

     ~tTherefore His Holiness  

 Baha'u'llah, fifty years ago, expounded this question of Universal  Peace at a time when He was confined in the fortress of 'Akka and was wronged and imprisoned. 

 He wrote about this important matter of Universal Peace to all the sovereigns of the world, and established it among His friends in the Orient. The horizon of the Ett was in utter darkness, nations displayed the utmost hatred and enmity towards each other, religions thirsted for each other's blood, and it was darkness upon darkness. At such a time 

His Holiness Baha'u'llah  

 shone forth like the sun from the horizon of the East and illumined Persia with the lights of His teachings." 

 Nor is His prophetic challenge lost. Across the bay from 'Akka in the city of Haifa there lives today the great-grandson of Baha'u'llah Himself, first guardian of the Baha'i Faith, Shoghi 

Effendi, whose World Order

 Letters have cast a brilliant searchlight  on the path to peace. The community of Baha'u'llah has spread its wings over sixty countries and seventeen dependencies. 

 Its unifying teachings are disseminated in over forty languages, and within its own ranks are to be found thirty races, all classes, and a vast diversity of gifts. Its influence in press and radio, forum and platform is gaining ground. The uncompromising unity of its own membership assures the world that men can live together despite differences of color, nationality or creedal inheritance, and this in itself is an assurance of the world's peace. 

 Meanwhile the forces of unity, stirred by the pen of a mighty Prophet, have swept from prison to palace and gradually permeated  the world. 

 In His Tablets to the kings, Baha'u'llah seventy years ago enjoined upon them a vast, all embracing assembly, one universal language, and one common script, reduction of armaments and excessive expenditures, a representative form of government,  a world tribunal, abolishment of racial, national, and religious prejudice, equality of men and women, and the adherence  to one common Faith. World force for the common safety was likewise advised. "Should any one among you take up arms against another," He said, "rise ye all against him." Shoghi Effendi writes, "The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha'u'llah,  implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently  united a world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising un —  challengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources,, blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated  from the curse of war and its miseries,  and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation — such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving." 

 A few were not careless of Baha'u'llah's clarion call. The revered Queen Victoria of England received the Message with great sympathy, and her granddaughter, 

Queen Marie of Roumania   

 has had the historic distinction  of being the first of Royalty to embrace the Faith. 

 She has written: "The Baha'i teaching brings peace and understanding."  t~It is like a wide embrace." 

 "To those in search of assurance, the words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering." 

 Many of the monarchs and religious leaders  bluntly opposed the call; others were preoccupied. In vain the great Prisoner of 'Akka pleaded with them to regard the things of the earth as transitory and worthless.  "The generations that have gone before you," He reminded them, Cchith are they fled? And those round whom have circled the fairest and loveliest of the land, where now are they?" "Your lives pass away as the winds pass away, and the carpets of your glory are folded as the carpets of old were folded." 

 His voice alone seemed to be the Voice crying in the wilderness with grave warnings.  "The world is in travail, and its agita

 Indeed, so dark are the warnings, descriptive of the heart-shattering suffering that must purge and purify an unregenerated and careless world, that without His promise  of God's ultimate design we might well find ourselves hopeless in the face of our own holocaust of madness, tSoon will the old order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead." "'War shall cease between nations," explains 'Abdu'l-Baha, "and by the will of God, the Most Great Peace shall come; the world will be seen as a new world, and all men wilt live as brothers." "The Call of God, when raised, breathed a new life into the body of mankind, and infused a new spirit into the whole creation. It is for this reason that the world bath been moved to its depths, and the hearts and consciences of men been quickened." 

 "Ere the close of this century and of this age, it shall be made clear and evident how wondrous was that springtide, and how heavenly was that gift." 

 Has religion a part to play in the ttMost Great 

Peace"? Baha'u'llah's     

 answer rings around the world: That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all-power-ful and inspired Physician. 

 This verily is the truth, and all else naught but error." Religion is the soul of world order. 

 The old world is divided into more than a thousand Cto ~ Sect upon sect has arisen, each striving to reform religion. Christ said, "Er kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against it —  self falleth." It is evident that sectarian religion cannot create a whole world soul. "Who, contemplating the helplessness, the fears and miseries of humanity in this day, can any longer question the redemptive love and guidance?" The 

Revelation of RaM'-u'116h 

 comes to us as an unfoldment of the Plan of God for our time, "divine in origin and all-embracing in scope." We can oniy recall with deepest gratitude the long years of exile and suffering in the path of God of One who turned from the world to write the Tablets to the kings. We can oniy "shout

  for joy" with Carmel, the scene of His exile, that historic mountain of the Jews where the tCL of God" was to "come unto Zion" in the (clatter days." Ours to thank God with contrite hearts that a World Faith has been born, suffered its martyrdoms, and lived to encircle the earth with hope and wisdom. 

 And what can a World Faith do? It is the work of World Faith today to refire the dying spirit, to give birth to the consciousness  of the oneness of mankind, and to provide  the power and form of peace in brilliant,  indestructible pattern. Of the first 'Abdu'l-Baha said, ttMaterial civilization is like the body. No matter how infinitely graceful, elegant, and beautiful it may be, it is dead. 

 Divine civilization is like the spirit, and the body gets its life from the spirit, otherwise it becomes a corpse. 

 It has thus been made clear that the world of mankind  is in need of the breaths of the Holy Spirit." The forces of irreligion, sweeping over the world today, often in militant, aggressive forms, give ample proof that ~~the vitality of men's belief in God is dying out in every land; nothing short of His wholesome  medicine can ever restore it. The corrosion  of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human society; what else but the Elixir of His potent Revelation can cleanse and revive it?" 

 ~'Re1igion is the greatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and for the peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein." True religion is the Most Great 

Peace.                     

 Of the birth of the consciousness of the oneness of man He said, ctNaught but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing the divergent  thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and convictions  of the children of men." The false gods of racialism and nationalism have so far perverted the masses that nothing short of a complete reversal of thought can save us from such aftermath of the war as may prove totally destructive. CCB as the fingers of one hand," commanded Baha'u'llah, ctand the members of one body." Such an emphasis is the need of the hour. 

 The third necessity is a new and universal pattern. 

 For Baha'u'llah, according to Sho-gbi  Effendi, "has not oniy imbued mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit. He has not merely ununciated certain universal principles, or propounded a particular philosophy,  however potent, sound and universal these may be. In addition to these, He, as well as 'Abdu'l-Baha after Him, have, unlike the Dispensations of the past, clearly and specifically laid down a set of laws, established definite institutions, and provided for the essentials of a Divine Economy. 

 These are destined to be a pattern for future society, a supreme instrument for the establishment of the Most Great Peace, and the one agency for the unification of the world, and the proclamation of the reign of righteousness and iusrice upon the earth." 

 Everyone is today aware that unorganized aspiration cannot unite the world. 

 Let us examine the p~tcern of Baha'u'llah with unprejudiced eyes. Every major Prophet of God releases an emphasis according to the crying needs of His time. For example, Moses taught righteousness as an emphasis; Jesus stressed personal mercy. 

 Mul?ammad taught submission to God because of the lawless condition of His people. 

 Today the emphasis of God's Law is unity. "In every dispensation the light of divine guidance has been focussed upon one central theme," explains 'Abdu'l-Baha. CCJ~ this wondrous Revelation, this glorious century, the foundation of the Faith of God and the distinguishing features of His Law is the consciousness of the Oneness of Mankind." 

 Unity is not lust a principle today; unity is a Law! 

 The command  of God has gone forth, and with it the power to see it through. Out of our chaos a Voice has been heard, a Voice above the false gods of racialism, nationalism, and militant atheism, a Voice ringing with authority, a Voice that is the Law that alone can set in motion new and far-reaching social trends. 

 How often in the past the divinely revealed Laws have set in motion social trends destined to completely reshape the affairs of men. Who shall dare to limit the effect of the ten commandments of Moses? Who can deny the effect of the Laws of Jesus? Who can fail to see the rise of the Arabic people in the middle ages, following the proclamation of Mubaninud's Law? Every stability we claim must acknowledge as its source the

  coming of divine Law to a people. A single example is the working week. 

 What a factor in social well being is the Law of Moses for a sabbath day of rest and worship. 

 Or the institution of marriage. Millions have obeyed, though often ignorant of the Biblical source of such a social obligation. 

 Gigantic trends, born of the Word of God, periodically sweep forward an ever advancing civilization. 

 Government without law is anarchy. Even the lesser or political peace must have its charter. The Book of Laws of Baha'u'llah has been called the Charter of the Most Great Peace. 

 "Blessed is the man," wrote Baha'u'llah, "who will read it and ponder the verses." "Ere long will its sovereign power, its pervasive influence, and the greatness  of its might be manifested on earth." In addition to the emphatic command to social unity, we find laws prescribing prayer and fasting, laws condemning intoxication and the use of opiates, prohibiting beggary, slavery, gambling, and such ritualistic observances  as penance, monasticism, confession, and professional priesthood; providing for marriage and controlling divorce, governing  taxation, inheritance, and treatment of criminals; commanding universal education, fellowship with all religions, and complete obedience to governments; exalting serviceable  work to the plane of worship, and exhorting  the people to cleanliness, honesty, chastity, hospitality, courtesy, forbearance, justice, and a clean and wholesome life. Such laws strike at the roots of our modern corrosions.  Already their leaven is spreading. 

 Following upon the revelation of His laws, Baha'u'llah, mindful of the intense spirit of division rampant in the world, forged a unity capable of succeeding Him. Two institutions He gave to the world, by which His laws and teachings could be applied and preserved  from corruption. 

 Foremost in importance, and closely linked to the heart of the Revealer Himself, is the institution of His own hereditary succession. It fell to 'Abdu'l-Baha, His eldest son, and the appointed Center of His Covenant, to gather together the bereaved handful of His followers after His passing. Without 'Abdu'l-Baha,  these followers, persecuted by enemies within and without, grief-stricken and bewildered  by the loss of their adored One, might well have lost, not •oniy their own identity, but the chosen pattern for world unity so recently entrusted to them. 'Abdu'l-Baha was everywhere. By pilgrimages of newly awakened souls of the western world to the sacred soil of 'Akka, by written Tablets  to all lands, and by means of an historic iQurney westward in 1911 and 1912, 'Abdu'l-Baha lent His spiritually transforming presence to the friends of God, serving at once the closely knitted community of Baha'is themselves, and implanting the seeds of the education for peace that was to progressively flower in a League of Nations, and eventually a Federation of the World. 

 With the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1921, the need, far from growing less, became greater with the rising tide of sharp spiritual and social differences in the world at large. The guardianship of the Faith, implied in the Book of Laws, became a fact in the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, who appointed  as first guardian, his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In this remarkable document each passing generation of DaM is receives its assurance of leadership by a lineal descendant  of Baha'u'llah. 

 Each generation will enjoy, in its guardian, complete protection  from schism. 

 In him will be vested the right of interpretation of the Word, and to him is given the promise of the direct guidance of God. Thus the Ocean of Truth chooses its tributary in the Day of Unity. The voice of division is stilled; compromise and sectarian corruption are banned in an age that has torn into countless sects the essential  truth of the ages. 

 If the succession is important in the preservation  of the truth, legislation is no less needed for the application of the laws. The second pillar of the new society is an institution  specifically set forth by Baha'u'llah for the government of His world conitnun-ity;  namely the Universal House of Justice, to be selected by the people of all countries, having the Guardian as its permanent head, and to be vested with final authority in all matters. Such universal representation, freedom of selection, and strength of authority combine to create an organism in which stability  is perfectly blended with freedom. 

 Completely representative government religion, for the people and by the people.

  without professional clergy, and on a worldwide  scale, strikes a new note in religion. Alfred Martin wrote significantly: "Who shall say but that just as the little company of the Mayflower, landing on Plymouth rock, proved to be the small beginning of a mighty nation, the ideal germ of a democracy which is true to its principles, shall yet overspread the habitable globe; so the little company of Baha'is, exiled from their Persian home may yet prove to be the small beginning of the worldwide movement, the ideal germ of democracy in religion, the Universal 

Church of Mankind?" The    

 elements  of its principles and its government are the elements of the Most 

Great Peace.               

 It is not for us to say by what steps the world at large will adopt the laws and institutions of a newborn Revelation. 

 Nor can we prophesy how long will be the period of the half light, encompassed as it is by the confusions and fears of a bitterly disillusioned  humanity. 

 But it is for the Corn —  munity of God to offer three gifts without price or limitation: It will continue its education for peace. 

 It will continue to conduct its ordered life on the practical basis of example, that all the world may witness a God-directed autonomy of fusion in race, class, creed, and nationality, without compromise  or fear; for here lies an evident assurance  of the world's peace. It will maintain a pattern, divine in origin and all-em-bracing in scope, which if chosen by the world, could outlaw war, and maintain in its own essential unity the God-given rights of the individual and of society. 

 At no time will such a pattern permit or condone opposition  to any government. 

 At all times its very being will continue to be the sign of fellowship and loving association with all religions. "The method it employs, the standard it inculcates, incline it to neither East nor 'West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor poor, neither white nor colored. Its watchword is the unification of the human race; its standard the Most Great Peace." 

 And in conclusion, let us all take heart and see the hand of God in every matter. We have only to look about us to discern God's bow of promise. In what other age has popular education swept the earth? When, previous to our present time, have men walked the ocean beds and plumbed the stratosphere? In what other age has science hurled together the very ends of the earth? In which previous dispensations has the light of God entered in a single century seventy-eight countries, on all five continents and some of the islands of the seas? 

 "The Revelation of Baha'u'llah, whose supreme mission is none other but the achievement of this organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should if we be faithful to its implications, be regarded  as signalizing through its advent the coming of age of the entire human race. 

 We can no more divorce His mission from the social problems of our time than we can divorce religion from life or God from human  affairs. If religion is life, religion then is economy, race relations, public safety, government, and moral living. Religion is civilization. At our very gate stands the first universal civilization, clothed in the Most Great Peace. The forces, powers and instruments by which we may forge a new world are in our hands. C!SO powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth." 

 tt'Mar shall cease between nations,  and by the will of God, the Most Great Peace shall come; the world will be seen as a new world, and all men will live as brothers." 

  These three talks on the general theme "The Assurance of World Peace" were given in Foundation Hall, Baha'i House of Worship, Wilmette, Illinois, on April 29, 1945.

            THE CALL TO GOD: A MEDITATION

          B~ ARCHDEACON GEORGE TOWNSJTIEND

  WHEN God came back into a world which bad forgotten Him He sent as His herald His Best Beloved, the Bib, in whom the Spirit of Love was manifest with such radiance that His disciples knew him as "the Ravisher of Hearts." 

 Baha'u'llah Himself in that little volume, The Hidden Words, into which He has distilled the essence of all revelations teaches that before the foundation of the world God knew His love for man and therefore created him. lie breathed within man a breath of His own spirit"; "engraved on him His image," and bestowed on him endless bounties. 

 One of these gifts, Justice, is "the sign of thy loving kindness" since through its observance every man can win knowledge for himself. 

 The first demand which Justice makes on man is that be shall love his Creator. CCJ loved thy creation, hence II created thee. Wherefore, do thou love me that I may name thy name and fill thy soui with the spirit of life. 

 Love me, that I may love thee. If thou lovest me not, my love can in no wise reach thee. My claim on thee is great: it cannot be forgotten." 

 (H.W.A. 4, 5, 20.) Reunion with God is man's heavenly home. The love of God is man's Paradise. It is his stronghold, in (to) which, if he enter in, he shall be safe and secure — But if he turn away therefrom t~he shall surely stray and perish." 
(H.W.A. 9.)                

 Righteousness has two supports — both spiritual. 

 One is the love of God — t Walk in My statutes for love of Me." (H.W.A. 18.) The other is the fear of God, without the restraint of which and the knowledge of the certainty of retribution, the selfishness of man could not be held in control. ccWe have admonished our loved ones" writes Baha'u'llah,  ttto fear God: a fear which is the fountainhead of all goodly deeds and virtues. 

 The fear of God is the chief cause of the protection of mankind and the sin-preme instrument for its preservation. (Wolf. 

 pp. 135 and 27.)" Aledne Baha frequently adverted to the close relationship between faith and morality.  For instance He wrote (Tablets, 549) CCB Faith is meant first conscious knowledge and second the practice of good deeds. 

 Although a person of good deeds is acceptable  at the threshold of the Almighty, yet it is first to know and then to do." 
(Tab-lets,  Page 549.)     

 "The cause of eternal glory to man," He writes, "is faith and certainty and then acting according to the behests of the 

Eternal God~" (Tablets     

 667.) God requires  good deeds from one who loves 

Him. 'tNcglect not My      

 commandments if thou lovest My beauty ." (J-LW.A. 39.) 

 Through Faith and Righteousness, we are taught (and not without them) the world may be united. For the virtues are the means by which people are enabled to live together in peace and happiness. Generally speaking, whatever tends to harmony is right, and whatever promotes discord is wrong. 

 Integrity, loyalty, fidelity, kindness, forbearance, mercy, generosity, trustworthiness, equity, hospitality, and the like, all trend to social concord, wellbeing and unity. If the scope and field of the virtues be not walled in by prejudices or bigotry, but expand without hindrance, then they will find their natural goal in uniting all the peoples of the globe. 

 Faith will attract the help of the Holy Spirit without which the division forces of earth life cannot be mastered; and faith and the knowledge of God will alone be able to end that fierce struggle for existence which 'Abdu'l-Baha calls "the fountainhead of all calamities and the supreme  affliction." 

 For Faith is a "divine elixir" which ~ttransmutes the soui." When a believer turns in faith towards God a profound change in his being is wrought through which he becomes a creature." 

 'Abdu'l-Baha  likens this change to the antenatal process whereby spiritual forces surrounding the body of an infant as it is formed before


<p660>

  birth gradually permeate it according to the degree of its receptivity. Similarly a believer's  faith draws about him the everlasting bounties of God which he by degrees appropriates  into his being according to the measure  of his capacity and of the spiritual preparation he has made. (Tablets 157.) Man's natural condition is that of an animal: until he is born again from this and detached from the world of nature he remains essentially  an animal, "and it is the teachings of God which convert this animal into a human soul." (Letter to the Hague.) 

 The soul is an intermediary between the spiritual world and the material world. In its higher aspect it looks up toward the Kingdom of Glory, in its other aspect it looks downward toward the lower sphere where darkness and ignorance have their home. If spiritual light be poured down upon this lower phase of the soul and if the soul be able to receive it then the truth is made clear and falsehood is of short duration. 

 But if such light does not come or is not accepted, then darkness gathers about the soul from all directions, it is cut off from the spiritual world and remains in the lowest depths. (Tablets p. 611.) 

 'Abdu'l-Baha used the picture of the Waxing of the Moon to illustrate the gradualness of this heavenward conversion and detachment  from the world. The believer when first he turns to God and receives his light is like the crescent moon which is illumined on its sunward side but has the face it turns to earth still in shadow. When the moon is full, and, turning to the sun's light the same face it turns to earth, is illumined throughout its whole circumference so that no shadow anywhere remains, it becomes a type of the spiritually mature soui. (Tablets 108.) 

 The reality of this severance is shown by a remark attributed to 'Abdu'l-Baha —  "The Holy Spirit moves my limbs." 

 The results of spirituality, the Lull meaning  of reunion with God, are not however made known to man fully till the Hereafter. "Sorrow not if in these days and on this earthly plane things contrary to your wishes have been ordained and manifested by God, for days of blissful joy, of heavenly delight are assuredly in store for you. Worlds holy and spiritually glorious will be unveiled to your eyes." (GI. 329.) 

 The purpose of earth life is to acquire the qualities that will be needed in those other worlds: as "the knowledge and the love of Cod; faith, sanctity, spirituality, eternal life." 

 To a "pure, kind, radiant heart" is promised  sovereignty ancient, imperishable and everlasting." Could man behold that immortal sovereignty, he would ccstrive to pass from this fleeting world." 
(H.W.P. 41.)              

 But the journey to God is not easy to accomplish. 
God is a jealous God.     

 "Ye shall be hindered from loving Me and souTh shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. For minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain Me." Man must face a conflict in his own soul: Ctjf thou lovest me, turn away from thyself; and if thou seekest my pleasure regard not thine own    There is no peace for thee save by renouncing thyself and turning unto mc." (H.W.A. 7, 8.) 

 Only through the energy of his own volition  may the hidden powers of his being be developed. 

 Again and again man is called on ~to make an effort." He is reminded that the greater his endeavor to cleanse and refine the mirror of his heart the more faithful will be the reflection in it of the glory of the names and attributes of God, and that as a result of the exertion of his own spiritual faculties he will be able to Cctti the courts of everlasting fellowship." (G. 262.) 

 At the present time the way to God is particularly hard to find. For it is the Day of Judgment. 

 Mankind has been "taken unawares," as Christ foretold it would be. God can oniy be known through His Messenger;  and now there is a New Era, a New Advent, a New Messenger. Old forms and names do not avail now. Souls are being tested by their readiness to acknowledge the New Manifestation of God — as the Mosaists were tested by the advent of Christ. Men are being divided by God: some are taken, others left. 

 All behold the light; oniy the spiritual see its source. All men recognize a transition; only the spiritual understand its meaning. 

 But no soul, no Age is tested beyond its powers. 

 To those who seek to turn to God inspiration adequate to every demand is

  given. Great as have been the bounties poured forth from heaven in past Advents, ctthose~~ of today are greater far. Both in the Gospel and the Apocalypse the overwhelming  weight of this Second Coming and the victory of the righteous over the infidel have been foretold. A power above the ken of men and angels, we are assured, now enforces  men's obedience to the will of God. 

 The teachings on the spiritual life are such as beseem the age of man's maturity, when every soul is required to investigate the truth for himself. They are given in plain terms, not in ccproverbs~~ They are authentic, being the written word of Baha'u'llah or 'Abdu'l-Baha. They are not of doubtful in —  terpretation. 

 They are voluminous and comprehensive,  offering diverse approaches to knowledge and being adapted to diverse temperaments. 

 Owing to the labor of various  translators and predominantly to that of the Guardian, many of these teachings are accessible in English. 

 The earliest and perhaps (it is said) the greatest of Baha'u'llah's revelations on the Search for God is a little mystical treatise: 

The Seven Valleys. The     

 thought is subtle and profound; the idiom is oriental; but yet the book has a beauty, a charm and a rapture which have made it the dearest treasure of many a believer. 

 lit is the love-story of one who being separated from his beloved seeks far and long, eagerly, patiently, despite all hardships and through all vicissitudes for the one and oniy object of his dcsir&; and at last attains his goal in a union which will know no separation or end — t~When a true friend and lover meets the beloved one, the radiance of the beauty of the beloved creates a fire which burns away all veils, burns all he has and all he is, consumes his very being, so that nothing remains but the friend." 

 The story is one of a journey. But though we read of C~va11eys~ "cities," "heights," t~fie1ds" tcgardens,~~ yet it is made clear the changes of scenery are inward changes of emotion, of sensibility and the iike. The traveller passes from ignorance to knowledge, from illusion to discernment; love deepens, is cleansed, intensified, uplifted; wisdom yields to greater wisdom; joy trembles and is lost to make way for finer joy. The Seven Valleys  are seven experiences or groups of ex periences which all must pass through who would travel this way to the end. 

 The story is lyric rather than dramatic. Though it is (like Bunyan's masterpiece) an allegory of a pilgrimage to a Celestial City, there are no lions, nor giants in the way here, no Doubting Castle, no Vanity Fair. The enemies of the traveller dwell within his heart. 

 Evil is a negation, an imperfection. Nor is the iGurney lonely: the Beloved's presence is felt from the beginning, the Messenger  of Love is the pilgrim's guide throughout:  The moving impulse of the journey is not solely the traveller's own; the voice of his Beloved calls ever in his heart "seek thou no shelter save in the Bower of the Well-Beloved," and he is drawn onwards to the happy ending by a power not his own. 

 How far away these valleys from the earth we know today! How far these aims, this search from the pursuits and prolects of men and peoples now. 

 Yet we are given to understand that only by adopting The Hidden Words as the standard of right living and The Seven Valleys as a guide to human conduct will society be empowered to inaugurate the Most Great 

Peace.                     
     The Obligatory Prayers     

 are given to help a Believer in this search. They are, not concerned  with the objects so familiar at this time — as the expansion of the cause, the giving of the message, the unifying and pacification of the peoples. No. They are designed to be used daily by Baha'is of all degrees for generations and centuries to come. They are about that which Baha'u'llah wishes to be the essence and constant center of Baha'i devotion and thought. Comprehensive and complex they may be: but their subject is one and simple. It is the knowledge and the love of God. 

 The Short Prayer states the whole matter in a word: t~Thou has created me to know Thee and adore 

Thee."                     

 The Medium Prayer is more particular. It specifies in two verses the fact of the Mani —  festation. 

 The first verse presents this in its transcendant aspect, proclaiming God's 

Advent  and His Sovereignty.

 The second acknowledges His omnipresence and unity, gives the substance of His Revelation and remembers the champions of the 

Faith.


<p662>
662             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The Long Prayer develops the theme still more fully and deeply. It seeks the vision of God's Beauty, an approach to His presence, an eternity of progress in His knowledge.  The main phases of the thought seem to be Self Surrender, 

Confirmation, Adoration  

 and Thanksgiving, Penitence, and Trust in forgiveness and redemption through the special graces of this Dispensation. 'While this Long Prayer has one definite, elevated subiect, believers have found that they can apply it, or major parts of it, to a special crisis or a special act in their own lives and can thus the better understand the Prayer and spiritualize their problems. 

 How marked and how significant, on the one side the correspondence and on the other the contrast that exist between this prayer of the New Age and the Lord's Prayer which Christians have been repeating for nineteen centuries. 

 Here is reflected the continuity of the work of Christ and Baha'u'llah and the Oneness of their common purpose. Here too (in an hour when many Lear Christ has thrown away His teaching on an unworthy race) is a testimony to the ultimate success of His glorious ministry and sacrifice. 

 The first petitions of the Lord's Prayer are for the coming of the Kingdom of God on earth. 

     The Obligatory Prayeis    

 imply and declare that the Kingdom has come: for instance "the All-Possessing is come. Earth and heaven, glory and dominion are 

God's                     

 and "He who bath been manifested is the Hidden Mystery through whom the letters  CB~ and CE~ have been joined and knit together " (that is, mankind's true existence begins in the New Era). 

 The Lord's Prayer remembers a prophecy and a promise; and centers men's attention on a triumphant future on earth. The Obligatory Prayers contain no prophecy and aim at an inward spiritual attainment. 

 Christ's Prayer is social in form. It is suited to spiritual children, being very simple and largely practical. in the words "as we forgive those who trespass against us" it adverts to the virtue of personal mercy to which Christ gave special prominence. 

     The Prayer of Baha'u'llah   

 is personal and mystical, advanced in character and suited to a maturer race. It carries the idea of communion and unity far, invoking in the Long Prayer all the Prophets of the Ages, interceding for the past heroes of the Faith, and joining the worshipper's testimony to this Era and its Prophet with the testimony of those in the highest heaven and of the Tongue of Grandeur itself as well as with that of all creation. 

 Besides these and similar prayers, the Guardian has given us in the volume 

Prayers  and Meditations 

 a number of other prayers of a different origin — prayers made by Baha'u'llah for His own use, acts of communion  between the Prophet Himself and the 

Most High.                

 To these a special mystery attaches, as He Himself affirms (p. 282) and they are bequeathed to us by His particular grace. They offer us a new approach to the know!-edge of God, and constitute perhaps the highest point we can attain in our mystical contemplation of the Prophet's ministry. 

 Some of these pieces are ascriptions to the power, the exaltation and the munificence of God. Others deal with His creative and redemptive  work. 

 Others belong to dramatic moments in His struggle against the evil forces of His environment. The range of thought and emotion which we find in them far outreaches ordinary human experience. On the one hand it soars to unimagined heights of adoration and triumph and joy. On the other, it plumbs depths of such anguish as only the truest love could know. But whatever the subject or the occasion of these prayers they all are one continuing diverse song of self-surrender and praise and thanksgiving to God. From every page —  now in phrase or in sentence or paragraph or sometimes in a whole long prayer of glowing and sustained emotion — pour forth tributes of adoration magnifying the eternal Beauty of Him whose love gives sustenance to the universe and who with ont least drop from the infinite ocean of his Mercy now redeems and beatifies mankind. 

 Love for God inspires every thought and deed. 

 "In Thy path and to attain Thy pleasure, I have scorned rest, joy, delight. I have wakened every morning to the light of Thy praise and Thy remembrance and reached every evening inhaling the fragrance of Thy mercy. 

 The fire of Thy iove that

  burneth continually within me hath so inflamed  me that whosoever among thy crea -tures  approacheth me and inclineth his inner ear towards me cannot fail to hear its raging within each of my veins." (pp. 103, 270.) CcNothing whatsoever can withhold mc from remembering thee though all the tribulations of earth were to assault me from every direction. 

 All the limbs and members of my body proclaim their readiness to be torn asunder in Thy path and for the sake of Thy pleasure, and they yearn to be scattered in the dust before Thee. Oh, would that they who serve Thee could taste what I have tasted of the sweetness of Thy love." (p. 152.) Upborne by this love He counts toil in God's cause to be '~b1issfu1 repose," ttanguish a fountain of gladness" (p. 136). 

 He testifies to the Majesty of the Station held by Him; to the profound and subtle changes in this created world, through which this New Age, the Age of God, was brought into being (p. 295); to the supremacy and triumph of the Revelation (p. 275) and to the eclipse of man's wisdom and the collapse of his power and of his knowledge before the manifest glory and dominion of the Most High (p. 53). He gives a picture, unprecedented and unparalleled, of that spiritual  illumined world which He is building, the world ordained by God of old which now is to be realized — a world so incomparable to ours that though we read the divine description  of it our aspirations can form as yet no image of its unity, its felicity or its attainments. (Prayers 58, 184, etc.) One and all, these prayers have for their immediate background and occasion the events of His life and ministry. Dates are not given, nor circumstances. 

 But the prayers  evidently cover many dynamic years of intense and extraordinarily varied personal activity — the period during which He re —  gathered the stricken Bab's, reanimated their faith, laid broad and deep in men's hearts the foundations of the Baha'i Cause, and in spite of successive and accumulating difficulties, in spite of the oppression of priests and tyrants, the machinations of traitors and the lethargy of the public, in spite of sorrows, sufferings and frustrations beyond number, declared His Mission, proclaimed it to the Kings of the World and went down to His last long imprisonment in the city of 'Akka. 

 The splendor of His power, His constancy,  His spirituality shines out against the unremitting darkness of His earthly lot. For ever His human self complains and expostulates with Him under the weight of ceaseless affliction: "My blood at all times addresseth Me saying, ~O Thou who art the Image of the Most Merciful! 

 How long will it be ere Thou riddest me of the captivity of this world ?' To this I make reply: tfle thou patient. The things thou desirest can last but an hour. As to me, I quaff continually in the path of God the cup of His decree and wish not that the ruling of His will should cease to operate. Seek thou my wish and forsake thine own.'" (p. 11.) His abasement causes His friends to weaken and His enemies to rejoice. Yet He has Himself chosen this suffering (p. 278) and wishes life could be prolonged that He might suffer more for love of God. His afflictions increase His love and His redeeming  power. 

 (p. 1467.) He gives no sign of personal resentment; quite the contrary (p. 307). But He prays for the vindication of the Faithful and the punishment of those who oppose God and His Truth. CCWll beloved  is Thy mercy unto the sincere amongst Thy servants, and well beseeming Thy chastisement  of the infidels. Abase Thou, 0 my Lord, Thine enemies and lay hold on them with Thy power ,and might, and let them be stricken with the blast of Thy wrath." 
(pp. 121, 141.)            

 Here in this devotional record may be traced the spiritual creation and the first ideal beginnings of the New Age and its glories. 

 Here is fought and won in the heart and soul of the Prophet that battle which established for us the Victory of God on earth. Here is invoked that wrath of an outraged Deity which now overwhelms mankind  in its cleansing fires. 

 As one contemplates the awfulness of the tragedy unfolded in these pages, as one ponders over this intimate revelation of the impassioned love, the wrongs, the sufferings of Him by Whose stripes we are healed and Who for our redemption endured the abomination  of the world, the Call to God sounds

  with a new appeal, and one hears with a new realization and a new resolve the summons  of the All-Victorious. 
"Hear Me ye mortal birds! 

 In the Rose Garden of Changeless splendor a Flower hath begun to bloom compared to which every other flower is but a thorn and before the brightness of whose glory the very essence  of beauty must pale and wither. Arise therefore and with the whole enthusiasm of your heart, of your will, and the consecrated  efforts of your entire being strive to attain the Paradise of His presence and endeavor to enhale the fragrance of the incorruptible flower, to breathe the sweet savors of holiness and to attain a portion of this perfume of celestial glory. Whoso followeth this counsel will break his chains in sunder, will taste the abandonment of enraptured iove, will attain unto his heart's desire and will surrender his soul into the hands of his Beloved. Bursting through his cage he will, even as the bird of the Spirit, wing his way to his holy and everlasting nest. 

 ttNight bath succeeded day and day hath succeeded night, and the hours and moments of your lives have come and gone and yet none of you hath for one instant consented to detach himself from that which perisheth. Bestir yourselves, that the brief moments which are still yours may not be dissipated and lost. 

 Even as the swiftness of lightning your days shall pass and your bodies shall be laid to rest beneath a canopy of dust. What can ye then achieve? 

 How can you atone for your past failure? 

 "The everlasting candle shineth in its naked glory. 

 Behold how it hath consumed every mortal veil. 0 ye moth-like lovers of his light! 

 Brave every danger, and consecrate your souis to its consuming flame. 

 0 ye that thirst after him! Strip yourselves of every earthly affection, and hasten to embrace your Beloved. With a zest that none can equal make haste to attain unto Him. The Flower thus far hidden from the sight of men is unveiled to your eyes. In the open radiance of His glory it standeth before you. 

 His voice summoneth all the holy and sanctified beings to come and be united with Him. Happy is he that turneth there unto; well it is with him that hath attained, and gazed on the light with so wondrous a countenance."  (Gleanings, p. 321.)

              RELIGIOUS FOUNDATIONS OF
                     WORLD UNITY

             B~ DR. RAYMOND FRANK PIPER

  MY THREE main topics are derived from one tremendous sentence of 'Abdu'l-Baha: "It is. our duty in this radiant century to investigate the essentials of divine religion,  seek the realities underlying the oneness of the world of humanity, and discover the source of fellowship and agreement which will unite mankind in the heavenly bond of love." 

Topics:                    

 I.    The perilous opportunities of our time.

There is not one soui whose conscience does not testify that in this day there is no more important matter in the world than that of Universal Peace. Every just one bears witness to this." Ct~flne Most Great Peace," solid with concord and abundant  living, is everyman's yearning; it is the sublime goal of civilization emphasized by the Baha'i Faith. The objective is clear, but perils and opportunities unparalleled in history  face us. Consider seven perils of our dangerous age: Peril 1: The chasm between knowledge and practice.

  Dr. Raymond Frank Piper, guest speaker at the Centenary Banquet, May 25, 1944. Dr. Piper's address was entitled 

       "Religious Foundations of World Unity."

  immense treasures of truth; formally he accepts  scientific method, freedom, religious liberty, and other ideals, but he translates a pitiful fraction of his knowledge into action. This peril demands unity of words and deeds, an essential integrity and. sincerity of mind. 

 Peril 2: The lag of spiritual understanding behind mechanical communication. Amazing scientific instruments, such as radio, printing press, motion picture, and airplane, have erased boundary lines between nations and made the whole earth one physical environment; but high barriers of prejudice, ignorance, indifference, and misunderstanding continue to bound and bind such important  mental spheres as language, religion, and national affairs. Can we now match supranational machines with supranational patterns of cooperation? Can we create the mental tools of international understanding and cooperation which will remove the barriers  which separate and confuse us? This peril demands the unity of a universal auxiliary  language and of worldwide human sympathy. 

 Peril 3: The survival of parochial institu

  tions in a cosmopolitan era. Contemporary man is half modern, half archaic; parts of him remain nineteenth-century, medieval, and primitive. 

 He enjoys the universal fruits of agriculture, medicine, technology, and music without thinking of national labels; yet in his economic, educational, military, religious, and national organizations he is commonly parochial. 

 Frank Kingdon declares, "Here is the basic tension of our times. In actual experience we are world citizens but the institutions by which we live are provincial. 

 We are like children growing up in a home that speaks a language foreign to that of the surrounding community." This peril demands new patterns of worldwide  cooperation. 

 Peril 4: The conflict between prophet and multitude. 

 We recognize the tragic paradox that the multitudes crucify their greatest benefactors, and that communism itself needs commanding leaders. 

 We know that Plato feared democracy because it gave power to uninstructed, unrestrained crowds and decided  vital issues by quantity of votes rather than by weight of reasons. We have a right to fear the barbarians in our midst who want the benefits of civilization without paying the necessary cost of discipline. How reconcile  the powerful momentary desires of the masses with the considered plans of prophetic statesmen? 

 This peril demands symphonic societies in which prophet and people strive with new earnestness to serve one another, in which majority and minority hold each other in mutual respect. 

 Peril 3: The conflict between East and West. 

 Chasms of ignorance and of pride shut us from the spiritual treasures of the Orient and create many false and needless conflicts. Can we now build bridges of understa~x1ing whereby East and West may supplement each other and create a richer synthetic civilization? 

 This peril calls for an immense extension of sympathetic understanding between  the peoples of 

Occident and Orient.       

 Peril 6: The transition from destructive com4etition to constructive federation among nations. Mankind has gradually enlarged  social organizations from family, tribe, and state, to great nations; the next sociological and logical step is a family of nations. Can we now pass in an orderly, peaceful fashion into the parliament of man, the united nations of the world? This peril demands political and social acumen and unity of unprecedented grandeur. 

 Peril 7: The uncertainties concerning spiritual authorities. The average American does not know in~ whom to put his trust; yet he does not seek far because he regards himself as wise enough. The demand for common sense is small because everyone thinks he already has an ample supply. In fact, however, multitudes  of men are putting their trust in illusory or dangerous gods: technology, the collective state, an esoteric cult, a self-ap-pointed leader, or their own uncritical judgments, Can we find somewhere a prophet whose voice will command the confidence of men through its reasonable and righteous power? This peril demands a new understanding and unity of religious goals and an unshakeable trust in a Supreme Power outside ourselves. 

 These seven perils present a partial picture of the conflicts which afflict our age. At the same time every one of. them is a challenge to ias to advance to a higher level of civilization. 

 These problems are painfully acute to thoughtful Americans because, while we are yet children in world affairs, history has thrust us into the center of the world's stage. Time Magazine for May 22, 1944, page 21, reports some startling Gallup statistics: tt27~ 000,000 U. S. adults do not know that the Japs have taken the Philippines. 54,000,000 have never heard of the Atlantic Charter. More than half of the adult population does not know that the U. S. never belonged to the League of Nations." 

 Although we are untrained in universal outlook, we are necessary  for a successful new world order. 

 In three hundred years we Americans have acquired a prosperity that other nations emulate; they at least think we are successful.  They do not know all our shortcomings. In his book, They Shall Not Sleep (as reported in Qinnibook, May, 1944, page 40), Leland Stowe declares, "As I moved from one country or war zone to another nothing impressed me more than the frightening contradiction  inherent in America's position in the twentieth-century's revolution.

 'tHundreds of millions of the world's peo-pies look to the United States as the symbol of freedom and their greatest hope. 

 But the American people are tragically unprepared, both mentally and spiritually, for leadership in a new universe which we can neither prohibit  nor escape. Only a few of these rising, stirring, struggling legions of men and women realize that a large proportion of Americans are not at all certain about our own definition of freedom or about what democracy really implies in an age of machines  and mass production.~~ Now while we confront dreadful problems  a benevolent Providence has come to our aid. We read in the Hindu fihagavad-Cit  a (4:78) how Lord Krishna revealed that the Divine Being becomes incarnate in the world in any epoch in which lawlessness uprises in order that he may destroy evil doers and establish righteousness. Did not the Divine Mind antiicipate the perils of our day when, one hundred years ago, He commissioned the Baha'i prophets to bring us a universal gospel of unity which is remarkably adapted to meet our most urgent problems?  For every kind of conflict which assails  us this gospel provides as a remedy a definite pattern of unified action. 

 The Baha'i Faith has had a century in which to establish itself around the globe and to erect its greatest House of 'Worship near the heart of America, within two hundred twenty-five miles of our center of population. 

 The Baha'i teachings are providentially loaded with precisely the goods which we Americans direly need in this catastrophic era. 

 For our amazing intolerances they offer an inclusive tolerance the excellence of which is selfevident to them and to others who know it. The worldwide perspective and the universal principles which we need permeate  their scriptures. 

 They condemn every religion which breeds strife among men and exalt the c6mmon ideals in all the religions and high prophets of God. 

 Their prophet leaders possess the kind of picturesque and attractive personalities which Americans prize. 

 They have long set their wills to attain  those world institutions which we are just now finding indispensable for peace. 

 The Baha'i teachings can contribute immensely, I believe, to that training for world citizenship which we sorely need. 

 The amazing fitness of these teachings to our needs and their peculiar timeliness are two facts which attest their divine origin. 

 Now, a careful analysis of our maior problems proves that their so1utio~ must be spiritual, that is, through the creative, redeeming  power of men possessed of goodwill, cooperativeness, reverence, and other ethical qualities. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha declared, C!The kingdom of peace, salvation, uprightness,  and reconciliation is founded in the invisible world, and it will by degrees become manifest through the power of the Word of God!" Lewis Mumford closed his book, Story of Utopias, thus: "Other civilizations have proved inimical to the good life and have failed and passed away; and there is nothing but our own will-to-utopia to prevent us from following them. 

 If this dissipation  of Western civilization is to cease, the first step in reconstruction is to make over our inner world, and to give our knowledge and our projections a new foundation." 

 hi the Syracuse newspaper, the Post-Standard,  of May 17, 1944, the leading editorial  began with these words in black-faced type: "The American people are looking for strong spiritual leadership. 

 They want it not only in their churches, but as well in the country's leadership, in public office, in in-dttstry and business, in professional life and every other activity in which they engage." 

 Today no intelligent citizen or religionisr can escape the solemn obligation to know with clearness and certainty what are the safe spiritual foundations for the new age. Let us now fix firmly in mind seven concepts which are integral to the pattern of peace: three principles of belief and four of action. These seven principles are familiar but fateful. 
I have not invented them. 

 I merely point them out with admiration and humil —  ity. 

 They shine forth from many bibles and philosophies, but they gleam with extraordinary brilliance from the pages of Baha'i scriptures. 

 The Baha'i prophets speak with the triple authority of Divine commission, ethical rightness, and rational coherence. 

 Hear the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha: "The prophets of God have founded the laws of divine civilization. They have been the root

  of all knowledge. They have establjshed the principles of human brotherhood. 

 [Thisil spiritual brotherhood unites nations, removes the cause of warfare, transforms mankind into one great family, and insures Universal Peace. 

 Therefore,, we must investigate the foundation reality of this heavenly fraternity. 

 We must forsake all imitations and promote the reality of the divine teachings." 
                           
II. TRUSTWORTHY FOUNDATIONS
                           
        OF BELIEF.                 

  Philosophy is the serious business of determining the nature of reality and of defin-mg  the reliable ends of life. As a philosopher I am enthusiastic about ]lah&'i teachings because they abound in profound philosophic insight and because with philosophical sweep they focus attention upon the great prob.-lems. 

 They meet well the ultimate criterion of truth: a coherent and inclusive whole of ideas concerning reality. 

 Baha'u'llah ascribed a beautiful name to the body of essential truth; namely, " the City of Certitude." He said, "That City is none other than the Word of God revealed m every age and dispensation." He warns against mistaking common stones for the wondrous jewels of divine knowledge. 

 Surely we desire our plans for peace to rest upon the surest discoverable foundations. Let us now look at three enduring monuments in the City of Certitude: the reality of God, the greatness of man, and the scope of the Kingdom. 

  A. The Reality of God. 

  The one final ground of confidence and hope for the individual and for civilization is God. Detlared Baha'u'llah, ttGod's commandments are the greatest fortress for the protection of the world and for the preservation  of mankind." 

 A Chinese proverb asks, ~'If you offend Heaven, to whom can you pray?" Note four attributes of God: (1) God is the mysterious Supreme Being who sustains all things. Listen to the majestic  words of ]lah4'u'llTh: "All things are dependent upon His will, and the worth of all acts is conditioned upon His acceptance and pleasure." 

 "He is, in truth, the Fountain  of all life, and the Quickener of the entire creation, and the Object of the adora tion of all worlds, and the Best-Beloved of every understanding heart, and the Desire of all them that are nigh unto 

Him."                      

 The Baha'i books emphasize two proofs for God's existence: the perfection of the human mind and the order of nature. We read: "To connect and harmonize these diverse and infinite realities an all-unifying Power is necessary, that every part of existent being may in perfect order discharge its own function." 

 "Not a single atom in the entire universe can be found which doth not declare the evidence of His might." The poet, A. E. Johnson, affirms, "God is that but for Whom all disintegrates." 

 (2) It follows next that God is through His signs present everywhere. We read: "The divine breath animates and pervades all things." ttGOd standeth within all things and watcheth over all things." "The mirror of His knowledge reflecteth, with complete distinctness, precision, and fidelity, the doings  of all men." 

 ttWonder not, if my Best-Beloved be closer to me than mine own self; wonder at this, that 1, despite such nearness, should still be so far from 

Him."                      

 (3) God is good: God is loving and merciful, all-bountiful, the Most Generous, the Help in Peril, infinite in grace. 

 (4) Finally, God is the eternal Truth, the everlasting protector. 

 Several significant corollaries follow from this conception of God. Conscious cooperation with the will of God is the best balance wheel of personal life. One of Baha'u'llah's Words of Wisdom is, ttThe source of all good is trust in God, submission unto His command,  and contentment in His holy will and pleasure.~~ Further, if reality flows from one Cosmic Mind, then our philosophic view of the universe must form a unified system, and also the historic religions should have much in conunon. These are two important Baha'i teachings. 

 'Abdu'1 — Baha asserts, t~The foundation of all the religionA of God is one." 'Yhe fundamentals, the foundations, of all [religionsj are fellowship, unity, and love." Thus it is evident that devotion to one God is a practical basis for cooperation among religionists. 

 Baha'i leaders stress the existence of harmony among the teachings of the high


<p669>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS               669

  prophets and religions of the world. This fact of common values constitutes an urgent summons to religionists everywhere to silence their differences, to cooperate in battle against dangerous common enemies, and to gain the strength of union in seeking the goals they agree upon: the practice of goodwill,  universal peace, devotion to a Supreme Being, and others. 

 Wasteful strife among religions contradicts their essential purpose and obstructs the coining of peace. 

 The Baha'i teaching that the central aim of religion is to establish unity among mankind needs worldwide acclaim. The next step should be the active functioning of a federation  of religions in support of enduring peace. 

 The Baha'is contemplate "a World Religion, destined to attain in the fullness of time, the status of a world-embracing Commonwealth, which would be at once the instrument and the guardian of the Most Great Peace." Also, "that which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith." 

  B. The Greatness of Man. 

  The second foundation truth in the City of Certitude is the greatness and dignity of man. God has endowed man with intelligent freedom, and peace cannot thrive in any society which makes man a slave to any machine, human overlord, or totalitarian state. 

 The self is the bearer of all values; therefore, since there would be no human values without the self, there is nothing for which it can be exchanged. 

 The destruction of human beings in war is the most abominable  of all crimes, while the command to value life, to respect and honor one's neighbor is a supreme duty, second only to the love of God. 
   Listen to some of the      

Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah:

 ttO Son of Man! I loved thy creation; hence, I created thee. Wherefore, do thou iove Me, that I may fill thy soul with the spirit of life. 0 Son of Being! within thee have I placed the essence of My light. I created thee rich and revealed to thee My beauty. Thy heart is My home; sanctify it for My descent. 0 Son of Spirit! Noble have I created thee; rise then unto that for which thou was created." Elsewhere  he declares, "Upon the reality of man God bath focused the radiance of all of His names and attributes, and made it a mirror of His own Self. Alone of all created things man hath been singled out for so great a favor, so enduring a bounty." 

  C. The Commonwealth of 

Love.                      

  The third principle in the City of Truth is the commonwealth of iove, the Kingdom of God, the 

Most Great Peace. Baha'i   

 writings  abound in such exquisite words concerning love that I am constrained to quote freely. Let us distinguish three aspects of the commonwealth. 

 (1)     The basis~ of the commonwealth of love is the biological unity of the race. We read that !~The incomparable Creator hath created all men from one same substance." '~Humanity is one in kind; it is one race, one progeny. 

 All are fruits of one branch, waves of the same sea. In every respect all stand upon the same footing — all have the same requirements." 

 Hence, all men are potentially brothers because they are made alike by one 

Father.                    

 (2)     The cement of the commonwealth is love. CcThe religion of God is absolute love and unity." ttThou canst best praise God if thou lovest His'Ioved ones." 

 t~The foundation  of the Kingdom of God is laid upon iustice fairness, mercy, sympathy, and kindness to every souL" ctAll the creatures are equal in this one family of God save whosoever  is more kind, more compassionate — he is nearer to God." t~In the world of humanity the greatest king and sovereign is love." 

 (3)     The goal of the commonwealth of love is worldwide harmony and peace among men. 

 CCThe divine purpose is that men should live in unity, concord, and agreement, and should love one another." CtW~lj1 love is realized and the ideal spiritual bonds unite the hearts of man, the happiness and tranquillity of mankind will be immeasurably increased." 

 "The scope of Universal Peace must be such that all the communities and religions may find their highest wish realized  in it." I have now set forth three foundation principles of universal peace: the sovereignty


<p670>
670             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of God, the dignity of man, and the kingdom of love. 

  Ill. FouR URGENT RESPONSIBILITIES. 

  The three foundation ideas generate four compelling duties for every individual who truly desires universal peace and abundant life. 

 These responsibilities are not confined to Baha, although the very clearness and definiteness of the Baha'i revelation places a greater responsibility upon those who know it than upon others. While the major ideas are common to the great faiths, yet the Baha'i Faith is distinctive in the particular techniques of unity which it proposes for realizing the kingdom. 

 My article on "Ways to Wholeness" (World Order, Dec., 1943; Jan., 1944) specified a dozen kinds of fruit-Lul  ethical unities which remain empty abstractions until individual persons actualize, organize, embody them in action. The harmonious integration of all strands of these concrete unities will produce the Most. 

Great Peace.               

 The attainment of universal peace requires the cultivation of a whole company of spiritual  arts. The arts of making war have reached exceeding fineness; the subtle arts of making peace need now to be cultivated with the same, resolute and exacting intelligence.  The silencing of the implements of war will be no guarantee o?f enduring peace; that peace will be the joint product of multitudes of individuals who know how effectively  to execute the arts of peace. For each kind of peril, for every type of unity, special techniques must be devised and practiced.  The fashioning of a good life or a good society is no less a difficult art than winning a battle or building a battleship, an industry, a symphony, or a temple. 

 The emphatic point is that we dare not take lightly the problems of peacemaking; they are serious, perilous problems which challenge our most creative and consecrated intelligence. 

 Successful arts of peace will alone produce that genuine freedom for which we long: the mastery of all condi-dons,  physical and mental, which are necessary  for realizing our legitimate wishes lix the world. 

 Responsibility 1: is to practice the presence o/ the Spirit of God: to glorify Him, seek to know His will, to draw upon His inexhaustible power, and witness to his greatness. The writings of Baha'u'llah are rich in exhortations  like these: "The first and foremost duty prescribed unto men, next to the recognition  of Him Who is the eternal truth, is the duty of steadfastness in God's Cause. Cleave thou unto it, and be of them whose minds are firmly fixed and grounded in God. No act, however meritorious, did or can ever compare unto it. It is the king of all acts." 

 "Place not thy reliance on thy treasures.  Put thy whole confidence in the grace of God, thy 

Lord. Let Him be Thy       

 trust and thy helper in whatever thou doest." 
 What art is involved here? 

 The art of worship, of creative prayer. The essence of worship is the commitment of one's life to God and the endeavor to enlarge and adjust one's purposes to the divine will. The fruit of effective worship is clearer purpose and stronger good will. 

 Further, as soon as your faith is strong and joyful, you will want to make it attractive  to others by the art of skillful coin-munication.  Declares Baha'u'llah, crOur mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men." Again he says, "The essence of religion  is to testify unto that which the Lord hath revealed, and follow that which Lie hath ordained in His mighty Book." 

 'Abdu'l-Baha  urges, ttO friend! Be set aglow with the fire of the love of God, so that the hearts of the people will become enlightened by the light of thy love." 

 Daily rule number 1: Every day my trust in God grows stronger, and every day I tell someone of God's greatness. 

 Responsibility 2: the unwavering practice of love to one's neighbor. 

 The dignity of man deserves respect. The kingdom is composed  of persons who love. Love increases knowledge, encourages goodness, and conquers  evil doers. 

 Therefore, "Bi d are they who are kind and serve with kve." "The religion of God is to create love and unity." To increase the amount and the quality of good will in the world is a basic duty. 

 Hear the superb words of 'Abdu'l-Baha: cCEnkindle with all your might in every meeting the light of the love of God; gladden and cheer every heart with the utmost lov-ing-kindness; show forth your love to the


<p671>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS               671

  stranger just as you show it forth to your relations." 

 As more and more men dwell together in one loving family, universal peace draws nearer. 

 'X7hat art is involved here? The art of reconciling human differences on a higher and richer level. 

 Let us apply to personal relations  a basic rule in the appreciation of beauty: to find rhythm in every artistic work but also to find variety and originality. 

 To expect artistic works or human beings to fit our modes of desiring is tyranny. We can learn how to enjoy, utilize, harmonize varieties  of personality. The kingdom is like a great work of art; it is a unity in variety. 

 How does the man of good will treat an angry antagonist? 

 He sympathizes with him, quietly loves him, and thus subdues his emo-tons.  How deal with a controversial person?  If two souls quarrel about a question, both are wrong, for both lack that condition of good will which is a precondition of creative discussion. 

 Daily ride number 2: Every day I seek to appreciate someone different from me, and everyday I do some loving kindness to my neighbor. 

 Responsibility 3: to become an exftert in one art of pea ce-in aking, in one kingdom in slit ution. 

 The question for each of us is: What particular job can I do according to my ability in the immediate future to hasten the coming of the Most Great Peace? 

 Daily rule number 3: Every day I clarify my mission in the world, and every day I strengthen my chosen kingdom institution; or, if you prefer: Every day I define my duty as a world citizen, and every day I perfect my chosen art of peacemaking. 

 It is your duty tonight to think clearly of what is to be your contribution to the Mast Great Peace. 

 It is your duty tomorrow to define that duty more clearly. It is your duty every day to refine your technique in the kind of peacemaking in which you choose to be a specialist. And oniy you, with God's help, can finally discover your unique mission. 

 Baha'u'llah said, ccThe faith of no man can be conditioned by anyone except himself."  But every individual should regard himself as that crucial grain of sand which may turn the balance in favor of the reign of peace. 

 Behind the three duties already defined lies duty number four: an inclusive responsibil-fry,  the practice of creative faith. Creative faith means that dynamic synthesis of clear vision, trust in reality, and aggressive adventure  by which a person produces new conditions which are favorable to the coming  of the kingdom. 

 Such faith creates conditions which confirm our hopes; therefore, it is indispensable for the growth of the kingdom. 

 If faith in a fact will help to create the fact, then it is our duty to believe. 

 What facts ground our faith? These: Reality is orderly, reliable. 

 It is weighted in favor of the good man because it is God's world. Life is not static but progressive, long-reaching, eternal. The world is "in-finitely  unfinished." 

 Happiness is not an end attainment, but a daily process of realizing particular goods. 

 Perfection is not a static effect, but the direction of personal expan-sian.  These are the grounds. 

 Here are the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha concerning faith: faith with knowledge is one of the "wings of ascent.~~ ~ is the means of the ascent of the human soul to the lofty station of divine perfections." 

 Faith is like the potential of the seed which you plant; you plant it with trust in an orderly world, and, with proper sunshine and rain, it becomes a magnificent tree. 

 I treasure the word of my teacher, W. E. Hocking: "Destiny in practice means the direction of your next step." If your next step, and the next, moves towards greater love, then your wellbeing is certain and your destiny secure; if in the opposite directiOn,  you are living in peril for yourself and you are obstructing the Most Great Peace. 

 Daily rule number 4: Every day I stretch my faith toward the coming of the kingdom of love, and every day I will do a concrete deed to hasten its realization on earth. 

 All the facts of history warn us: this is a time to live dangerously, to live assiduously, to live creatively. Every day is precious and perilous; and the days of opportunity are passing swiftly. Contemporary minds are more plastic than ever and more receptive to words backed by reality and love. Let us meet the incomparable challenge by more creative faith, by more intelligent devotion to God's cause, by finer arts of peace. The

  combination of Baha'i Faith with American ingenuity and energy should make a winning team for the establishing of enduring peace in the world upon solid foundations. 

 I want to conclude with some superb words from the sacred writings, first of 'Abdu'l-Baha: "Today is the day for steadfastness  and constancy. 

 Blessed are they that stand firm and immovable as the rock, and brave the storm and stress of this tempestuous  hour." ~ peoples of the world! 

 Arise and bestir yourselves, that My Cause may triumph, and My Word be heard by all mankind."  "Ye are now in a great station and noble rank, and ye shall find yourselves in evident success and prosperity, the like of which the eye of existence never saw in former ages.~~ And finally from Baha'u'llah: "God grant that the light of unity may envelop the whole earth, and that the seal, Cthe Kingdom is God's' may be stamped upon the brow of all its peoples." "Set your faces toward unity, and let the radiance of its light shine upon you.

             WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS TODAY

               B~ PROF. STAN WOOD COBB

       INTRODUCTION               

  The program of the Baha'i Movement for world peace and world brotherhood, as proclaimed  by its founder, Baha'u'llah, a hundred  years ago, is interesting to compare with the vital needs of the world today. It will be seen upon such a comparison how corn-pktely  and prophetically the world pattern of Baha'u'llah meets the exigencies of the present age. Many of His principles for a world civilization were unestablished and even unheard of at the time the program was given out. Events have moved continuously  in the direction of the Baha'i program,  so radical at the time of its pronouncement, but now appreciated by all intelligent people as vitally necessary to the world of today. 

 At present the Baha'i program is more than an idea — it is an actual movement of potency with organized followers in 78 countries of the world and a temple on the shores of Lake Michigan near Chicago, the maior edifice in the line of church architecture completed in this country since the depression, and acclaimed by many archi —  teas as the most beautiful building of modern  times. This movement for world peace, suppressed in Germany during the Nazi regime, and in Russia during the anti-re-ligious ligious period of Sovietism, is being restored in both these countries, has spread throughout  every state of this country, and is organized  in every country of Central and South America and most of Europe. 

 In Egypt, Persia, 'Iraq and India it is widespread. 

 It has succeeded in uniting to an unusual degree members of every major race and religion in the world. 
                           
WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS TODAY 

  1.  The World Needs Peace. 

 A hundred years ago peace was not felt as a desperate need of the world. Today it is so felt. The destructions, both militaristic and economic, caused by the first World War, and the terrific devastation, suffering and chaos caused by the second World War, have succeeded in completely disillusioning humanity as to the worthwhuleness of war. The atomic bomb was the last needed argument to prove that war is insanity. 

 There must be peace. This truth Baha'u'llah declared almost a century ago, sending messages  to all the rulers of the world exhorting them in the name of God to cease war and to establish universal peace. Little attention was paid at that time to this cry in the wilderness, for war was then a respectable enterprise. 

 It was a means of building up

  empires; of adding wealth and prestige to nations. 

 Arguments for peace sounded upon deaf ears. 

 Now the peace program of the Baha'is receives respectful attention from all audiences and individuals. The first need of the world is peace, declared Baha'u'llah. 

 The vast majority  of humanity now realize the truth of this statement. 

   2.     The World Needs a Form
of Super-Government.      

 There is oniy one way to eliminate war on this planet as an expression of rivalry between  nations, and that is a pattern of international  government, of world federation, which would supplant the jingoistic nationalism prevalent up to date. 

 Wilson, with prophetic vision, realized this in the first 'World War, and consecrated his remaining years to the establishment of such a federation. 

 His failure was due not to lack of vision, but to the recalcitrance of nations not yet ready to renounce the extremes of nationalism. As a result, the League of Nations, although it was the expression of a splendid and necessary ideal, proved futile to accomplish its primary  purpose of preventing war. 

 It may be interesting at this point to note that Woodrow Wilson was acquainted with the writings of Baha'u'llah on world peace and world brotherhood, and studied them in the privacy of his chamber, it is presumed intimately. 

 The world pattern proclaimed by Baha'u'llah  envisages a world federation as competently  endowed to manage the affairs of the various nations of the world as the United States was endowed by its Constitution with the management of its thirteen colonies. This world federation, as pronounced by IBaM'u'llah, would consist of a world legislature  which would be empowered to regulate such international affairs as world trade, the exploitation of the world's natural resources,  and the establishment of a universal weights and measures and monetary system. In this world legislature each country would be represented in accordance with its popu —  lation. 

 This world legislature would be supplemented by a world court which would have power to adjudicate all quarrels between nations, and its decisions would be enforced by an international police organization  if and when necessary. Conversely, as the power of an international police force was built up, national disarmamentation would gradually take place until an international situation came about approximating the situation in the forty-eight states of this country. Armamentation would be for preservation of internal order only and not for warfare between countries. 

 This world federation, as set forth by Baha'u'llah over seventy-five years ago, contained  several factors absolutely essential to a planetary super-government, but in advance  still of the thinking and practice of nationalism, as it exists even in this period


<p674>
674             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of ardent desire for world peace. For instance, the method of representation in accordance  with populations would give China, a country supremely weak in a militaristic way, a tremendous quota in the world legislature. 

 It would give backward countries, low in literacy and culture, a representation equal to or surpassing that of some countries high in civilization. The world is not ready yet to put such a pattern into practice. It may be a hundred years before it will be. But it is quite evident that tbis is the only fair and equitable procedure in the conducting of a super-government. 

 A second factor, absolutely necessary to world government, but in advance of humanity's readiness today to put such government  into practice, is the establishment of a world court which would have absolute power to adjudicate all friction between nations. This involves a renunciation of nationalism such as the world, with all its talk of peace, is not yet ready to put into practice. 

 A century may elapse before such a court can be established, but it must be and will be so established for the simple reason that an efficient world government can not exist without it. A third factor far beyond the preparation of the world today is that of national disarmament. 

 Instead of such disarmamenta-non, we see the great nations of the world energetically conceiving and preparing new and more terrible instruments of warfare. As the author writes these lines, squadrons of bigger and better bombers are buzzing overhead in formation practice, and a jet plane is zooming at a speed that spells menace to the world. 

 Yet the disarmament of the various nations  comprising a world super-government is absolutely essential to any efficiency of power of such a government. 

 Such renunciation  of the means of warfare is employed in all effective federation, as evidenced in the history of Switzerland and the United States. 

 The component parts of such a federation,  it is evident, can not possess greater military power than the federation as a whole. The federal army, to which is delegated the duty of maintaining order within the country and between the respective states, can not be weaker than the military power of any given state. 

 The rise of nationalism itself was predicated upon the disarmamentation of the feudal lords who, previous to the growth of nationalism, possessed greater military power often than the King himself. 
Henry II of France and     

Edward IV of England       

 had the vision to see that the power of the warrior barons must be destroyed if the kinghood was to have any actual power, and as a result of their efficiency in overpowering their feudal lords, these countries became the first in history to establish nationalism. 

 So today a world organization can be very little effective until it possesses a greater mu-itary  power than any of its component parts. This can come about oniy by the establish-inent of an effective inttrnational police force and the disestablisht'nent of militarism wi/hi it each nation. 

 The abandonment of militarism, expressed in disarmament by each nation of the world, must be simultaneous. 

 It would not be wise or safe for any one nation to practice disarmament until all were ready sincerely to put this measure into effect. 

 The world will not be ready for such a step until there has been established a strong mutual faith between  all nations, such as now exists between the 

United States and Canada.  

 War is practically  foresworn as between these two countries.  No fortifications protect their mutual borders and the mutual psychology and spiritual  attitudes prevailing in these two countries  is such as to render war between them unthinkable. To a lesser degree the same situation holds as between the 

United States and Great    

 Britain. This is because of strong linguistic, racial and cultural unities. 

 When all the peoples of the world approximate such unity, war anywhere will be unthinkable. 

 It will take a long period of time, and perhaps some trying ordeals of humanity, before the world is prepared to put such a radical program into effect, but such a program  is obviously essential to world organiza-non.  This pattern, as set forth hy Bah~'-u'  11Th, must and will eventually control the planet.

     3.     The World Needs a New

 Conscious-usess  of the Essential Oneness of 

Humanity.                  

 Baha'u'llah proclaimed, as the spiritual focus of his movement, the development of a new consciousness on the part of humanity which would rise above and stipersede the nationalistic consciousness. In this small planet, humanity is really one; and as all scientists have come to realize, there is but one species of humans upon the globe. The needs of these humans — regardless of the color of their skin, their language or their habitat — is in reality one and the same. 

 Until a consciousness of these needs which Baha'u'llah's preached can be established in human hearts, the ideals of world federation will fly upon weak wings. 

 That which gives strength and power to present day nationalism  is the psychology of unity which the principles of nationalism have indoctrinated in its peoples. 'Without such unity there is no coherent nationalism — as for instance is evidenced in the inchoate, unmilitary lumbering  empire of China, which has not yet developed any sense of national unity or national  efficiency. 

 A world united by any pattern not built upon a psychological unity would not be a stable world. On the other hand, when the desire for world unity is widespread, when the consciousness of other's needs is universally developed, when the desire for world brotherhood is prevalent in all peoples of the world, — then and not until then the right world pattern can be found, established, and executed with success. 

   4.     The World Needs a Universal
Auxiliary  Language.      

 Baha'u'llah declared a universal auxiliary language to be a supreme need of the world state, its purpose being not only to facilitate trade, travel and world culture, but to establish  the psychology of oneness. He stated in his epistles to the various rulers of the world that they should call a council and select a language to serve for such auxiliary interchange, — either an existing language or an artificial, one; require it in all the schools of the world; and in a generation establish it as a going concern. This Baha'u'llah de-dared  to be a spiritual obligation of mankind and he laid great emphasis upon it. Since this declaration of Baha'u'llah, a Polish edu. 

 cator, Zamenhof, conceived the vision, independent of any connection with Baha'u'llah, of an artificial language to serve in the capacity of an auxiliary world language, and toiling in his spare time for years he created Esperanto, now the leading contestant of some six rivals for the artificial world language,  including Ido, Nuvo Latino, New English, etc. The advantage of an artificial language ts that it is neutral. It does not violate the pride and self-esteem of nations devoted to the culture and spread of their own language. It escapes the implications of nationalistic imperialism, which the claim of any existing language to be the medium might arouse in other nations. The disadvantage of having an artificial language is its lack of economy, in that when studied it opens up no world of literature or learning to its students. 

 Many years must elapse before the world's literature would be translated and available in such a language. 

 The advantage of an existing language is, apart from the jealousy of other linguists, quite apparent. 

 Let us take, for example, the English language, the native language now of a great proportion of the world's population and territory; the cultural secondary language of countries representing almost half the world's population; and more important  still, a language in which exists either in original works or in translations a body of cultural and scientific literature which, I venture to state, is greater than all the combined literatures of all the other combined languages of the world. Therefore the advantage  of English as a world auxiliary language is that immediately a student of a foreign country acquired English, he would have available this immense literature existing in the English-speaking world. The dis-Statistics are not available upon this point, but scholars to whom the writer has propounded this claim have admitted that it is probably true. The reason that there exists in the English bnguage such an immense body of cultural and scientific literature is because the immense wealth of the AngloSaxon world, including Great Britain and the United States, and its cultural activities for centuries, have caused the translation of all valuable works of the world into its language so that in its combined libraries exists a wealth of world thought incomparably greater than that existing in any other language of the world.


<p676>
676             THE BAHA'! WORLD

  advantage of English is mainly in its spelling and in the natural jealousy of other linguistic nationals. 

 As for grammar, English has the simplest grammar of any nation in the world. Its only fault is its spelling, which, were English to be chosen as the auxiliary language, must necessarily be reduced to urn-formity  approximating, for example, the admirable phonetic uniformity of 

Spanish.                   

 It is to be noted that such an auxiliary language would not at first displace the native languages — it would be secondary to them. 

 It would greatly facilitate world travel, world trade and world thought. It is extremely essential to radio communications over the planet and to the development of the talking movie. It is apparent, upon consideration, that this universal secondary language would tend eventually to become the primary language. In other words, the time would come when the present individual languages would sink to a secondary level, as a classical storehouse of national culture. 
   5.     The World Needs the 

Establishment of a Common  
Universal System of Education Leading
to the Rise of a World     

Civilization.              

 Baha'u'llah declared that education should be universal and of a worldwide type. 

 In all the schools of the world the ideals of human brotherhood and world peace should be taught. We have learned from the last war how a system of education based on converse ideas leads to hatred, war and destruction.  We deem education so important toward world peace that we are superintending  the educational methods and ideas of the conquered countries so that war delirium may not again arise throughout an entire population. 

 If education is so important from the negative point of view, it is even more important from the positive and constructive  point of view. The most important obligation of the educator, from the Baha'i point of view, is to inculcate in children from the earliest age the spiritual ideals of world peace and world brotherhood, of serviceableness  to all people, of responsibility of the individual as a world citizen to aid in the needs of all of the world as a whole in addition  to the service he renders his own country. 

 A universal system of education for the planet imDiies the spread of technology with all its amazing developments in all fields of human enterprise — industrial, agricultural,  and sanitary. 

 So long as immense backward areas of the world remain retarded they serve as an enormous temptation to imperialism on the part of the more advanced technological nations. The world's resources are too important, too precious, and too limited  in quantity to be allowed to remain undeveloped  because some areas in which they exist are inhabited by people incapable of exploiting them. It is highly important to the establishment of a stable world society that all members of it become equally advanced  in technological ability. So important is this that Baha'u'llah enjoins it as a spiritual obligation on the part of Orientals to acquire the advanced civilization of the Occident. Such a spiritual motivation as Baha'u'llah declares for progress is needed to stimulate the mystic soul of the East. In the name of God they will make willing effort to progress in the arts and sciences. This is already evidenced in the strong and wholehearted efforts the Baha'i communities of Persia and other countries of the Orient are making to progress in education and in technology. 

 Such a world civilization does not necessitate uniformity in culture. 

 We may define civilization as the extent of man's progressive conquest of nature and utilization of her resources for greater comfort and pleasure of living; whereas culture may be defined as man's esthetic appreciation and adaptation of his environment. Technology requires more or less uniformity of method. 

 There is at any prevailing period one best way. This height of achievement established in one part of the world will tend rapidly to be copied and approximated in all parts of the world. But in the realm of culture, human taste and imagination rules. 

 There can be many forms and expressions of beauty. 

 A world civilization does not imply the destruction of cultures, various and charming, of each separate component nation and peoples. 

   6.     The World Needs a Reform
in Morals and a Spiritual  

Renaissance.               

 The morals of the various peoples of the world have been degenerating rapidly in the


<p677>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS              677

  last fifty years, with great acceleration after World War One and still more noticeably during and after World War Two. 

 The major factor in this degeneration is the falling away of religious motivation for conduct. Baha'u'llah's stated that the ills in the world today are due to the waning of religion. All over the world ancient religious customs and restraints have greatly weakened, leaving human behavior largely to the motivation of conv6nance — a French word which has no equivalent in English, meaning "that which is convenient or wise from a practical point of view." This is plainly not sufficient motivation  for moral conduct. The temptations of sensuality are too great to be safeguarded by the rules of conv~nance. 

 Nothing iess than the power of religious impulse can safely motivate human conduct. 

 Without going into details concerning the prevalence and accelerated growth of sexual laxity, of alcoholic excess, of commercial greed and dishonesty throughout this country  and throughout the world, it is evident that unLess there is a change in the direction of movement toward deterioration, the world will not be worth saving from another war. For if the retrogression in morals continues at the same pace as during the last twenty-live years, we shall soon have a world as decadent as that of Ancient Rome. 

 Baha'u'llah made strong demands upon his followers for lofty ethical conduct, nobility of character, the practice of spiritual restraints,  the exercise of daily prayer as a means of spiritual and moral strength, the development of a consciousness of God and love for Him, the expression of this Divine Love in attitudes and actions toward one's fellow men. 

 There is no other way, as far as the writer can observe, in which human morals can be lifted up, the terrifying pace of retrogression  checked, and the world saved from moral collapse. A few religious groups exist on the planet whose religious indoctrination and religious zeal is still strong enough to cause moral conduct. Among these spiritual societies, the Baha'is stand supreme in the loftiness of their conduct and the morality of their youth. 

    7.     The World Needs to Achieve
a Reconciliation  Between 

Science and Religion.      

 Baha'u'llah said that science and religion were the two wings upon which humanity flies. If either is weak, there will be disaster. He praised science greatly and its power to elevate the living conditions and the happiness of mankind. And he said that science and religion must come into accord. 

 'Abdu'l-Baha  remarked that if religion teaches things that are plainly not in accord with truth as science has demonstrated it, such religious teaching is not truth. 

 If we reflect a little it becomes evident that there can not be two truths about the universe. 

 There can not be one universe which is materialistic, and another entirely different universe which is spiritual. 
     Science has had its heydey.

 Because of its remarkable powers of analysis of nature, its precision in estimating the movements of heavenly bodies, its power of synthesis, its discovery and creation of new sources of power, it has acquired an enormous authority in the minds of all educated men and women. At present this authority far outweighs, among the intelligentsia, the authority of religion. 

 This is because religion still holds to traditions which, in the light of modern science, are ridiculous. 

 There can be no reconciliation between science and religion until religion abandons these false doctrines and forms; and science, on the other hand, becomes willing to recede from its position of dogmatism and unjustifiable positivism. Such welcome tendencies are today visibLe, fortunately, in the fields both of religion and of science. 

 But until a complete rapprochement occurs there can be no stability or wholesomeness in human psychology. 

 We all fail in mental health. We all have split-psyches so long as one side of our being supremely admires the teachings,  power and achievements of science, while another side of our being turns with longing and aspiration toward spiritual goals which science has derided. When the intelligent, educated and thinking people of the world acquire unity in psychology regarding the material world which they daily contact and the spiritual world which they ought daily to contact, life will be more wholesome and more joyous on this planet.


<p678>
678             THE BAHA'I WORLD

   8.   The World Needs Religious
Unity.                     

 The division of humanity into several great world religions, each apparently incapable  of absorbing the others, and into innumerable sects within each one of the great world religions, is not conducive to spiritual wholesomeness. This is one of the reasons f or the skepticism of scientists regarding  religion. If a skeptic is urged to become a religionist, he may with good logic retort~.~~ttWbich one of the world religions; and within that one, which one of its numerous  sects, should I accept as truth? 
Not all can be false.      

 Not any one can have all truth." As a result of such a situation, the intellectuals of the present day become eclectics, gleaning for themselves whatever spiritual  philosophy they have, but refraining from yielding themselves to any religion with claims of authority. 

 The Baha'i Movement declares the authenticity  of all the great world religions, but considers that their vital and primary truth has been overgrown and encrusted with traditions  and dogmas throughout the ages. There is only one God, there is only one spiritual truth. When all the peoples of the world unite in that truth and in allegiance to the one God, there will be found in such a unity of spiritual concept and practice an enormous motivation for unity of civilization,  unity of world government and stability  in all the affairs of men. 
   9.   The World Needs Faith.

 We need more faith in God, more faith in man and more faith in God's plan for a human society that reflects the Divine pattern  for humanity enunciated by Christ —  ttThe Kingdom of God on Earth." 

 DaM'-u'lUh  has restored that vividness of faith which inspired the lives of the early followers  of Christ — the faith that a better world is in the making and that God's will for humanity will never rest short of the establishment of a peaceful, united and happy civilization on this planet. To this faith and to this consummation the Baha'is the world over give their devoted allegiance. 

 They are, as one statesman in Washington recently said, the only optimists left in the world because they live and carry on with the absolute conviction that world peace will be achieved and that a new world pattern will emerge from the carnage and chaos of the past. 

 The Baha'is look forward confidently to a period beginning before the end of the present century in which a workable basis for peace will have been arrived at and the energies of the world will be devoted to the progress of humanity. They envisage the subsequent and more complete development of an ideal world society characterized by the principles already described, — world federation,  a universal language, the equitable development  and distribution of the world's resources, and the dedication of science to human progress and prosperity. 

 The Baha'is foresee a world in which all prejudice — racial, national and religious —  will have died away; in which a vital spiritual  brotherhood will unite the hearts of all peoples the world over. To this great goal they dedicate their lives and devote their activities. 

 As David Cushman Coyle, economist  and writer, recently said to the author, ~cT1~e Baha'i plan is the salvation of the world, if it can be spread fast enough." 

 The darkest hour is just before the dawn. The more that secular means for world unity fail, the more will humanity be inclined towards spiritual means. We shall not be too much perturbed by the present confusion and disunity prevailing over the planet, if we hold fast to the ideal pattern. 

 Right will ultimately prevail, because God is on its side. 

 No one can with assurance work for world peace today, unless he is sustained by a vivid faith that such peace is possible and ultimately practicable. 

 Short of faith in Divine guidance and Divine assistance, there is little to sustain the idealist today. The material aspects of the world are bad, and there is nothing to indicate that they may not grow worse. 

 As our forefathers, in working out the Constitution and in forging a unity of the thirteen colonies into a great nation, were sustained not only by great vision but also by faith in Divine guidance and assistance, so today the whole world needs assurance that God's will is working even in public events and that He will not leave this planet


<p679>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS               679

  in a condition short of attainment of His ultimate purpose, even though disaster become  an instrument of such purpose. 

 The Baha'is are sustained by the belief, based on the teachings of Baha'u'llah, that even planetary disaster will not be an end in itself but rather an instrument for the forging  out of a new world pattern and for the establishment of a new age of brotherhood and peace upon the earth.

           CALIFORNIA — HOST TO THE NATIONS

                   B~ MARZIEH GALL

  IT RAINED a little that first afternoon and the air was full of omens. 

For weeks, San Francisco   

 had been getting ready; signs read, "Let's clean up — company coming"; hotels put up scaffolding and had their outer walls steamed; flags of many nations lined the streets, that of the United States everywhere  at half mast for the late President, Persia's Lion and Sun at home with the rest. 

 Hundreds of people had concerned themselves with the Conferenc&. 

 They had organized  fleets of cars and buses, piloted by young women, for delegates and personnel; they had marshalled telephone operators knowing foreign languages, and stenographers, and information experts; at the Opera House they had collected Campfire Girls and Boy Scouts and nurses and chefs and waitresses. 

 Avenues were roped off, and patrolled by security police in white steel helmets. 

 Public address systems were set up. Pink and lavender rhododendrons were massed in the park opposite the St. Francis Hotel. 

 School children got out their autograph  albums and lurked in the crowded lobbies  like hunters in a duck blind; for weeks their school work was to focus on the Conference. 

 Handsome metal lapel buttons appeared  — pale blue for the Conference officials,  crimson for the press — bearing gold lettering and an outline of the planet, wreathed in laurel. 

 Not oniy the authorities, but all San Francisco was host: saleswomen; society matrons; postmen; bootblacks; mothers  holding up their babies to see the delegates go up the Opera House steps. 

 Perhaps it was the first fulfillment of what 'Abdu'l-Baha's had said of the Californians long ago: "I hope that advocates of peace may daily increase among them until the whole population shall stand for that beneficent  outcome. May the first flag of international peace be upraised in this State." 

 And every night during the nine weeks of the Conference, the big cross on Mt. Davidson  was illuminated, the beams rippling out under starlight and through the salt fog from the 

Pacific.                   

  The Opera House throbbed, that day, with enormous energy and exhilaration, heightened  by the intermittent lightning of ila~h bulbs in the semidarkness, and the whirring of newsreel cameras. Delegates filed in through lanes of guards in the crowded foyer. 

 Hundreds of observers, the lucky ones who had managed to procure tickets, jammed the balconies. 

 In the beginning, the State Department had selected forty-two organizations to be represented at the Conference by consultants; the Department then granted admission to representatives of a number of other national organizations and publications, among them the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada  and the "Baha'i World." As for the press, its list of representatives at one time totaled 2,300. 

 The public admissions office was soon to close down, snowed under 60,000 requests for tickets. 

 It was one of the most complex audiences ever come together under one roof. Negro writers, school girls, millionaires, women marines, college presidents, movie actors, wounded servicemen; and then the delegates themselves, men from all over the globe, leaders in their respective countries: vice-presidents,  prime ministers, ministers of for

  eign affairs, ambassadors. 

 And everyone there in the Opera House expectant, tense, waiting — not for a concert to begin, nor an opera —  but for peace to begin. 

 Music from somewhere wove through it, melancholy, not loud because of the recent death; then they were playing. "The world is waiting for the sunrise." 

 The lights went up, from the wings seventeen men and women of the United States armed forces marched on stage to form a guard of honor, America's Secretary of State entered with other officials, there was a tense pause, he banged the gavel four times, and perhaps it was destiny knocking. 

 A crowded minute of meditation, and then, by radio, the voice of the President of the United States, bringing America's message  to the United Nations. The voice was typically American; it symbolized America's contribution to international life; it was not martial, or authoritarian, or operatic; it was neighborly. The audience leaned forward as if the President were there. Bulbs kept on flashing, cameras whirring, as he spoke. "In your hands rests our future," the voice was saying. c(Justice remains the greatest power on earth. 

 To that tremendous power alone will we submit with Divine guidance, friendly cooperation and bard work we shall find an answer. 

We beseech Almighty God    

 to guide us in building a permanent monument to those who gave their lives that this moment might come." 

  And so it began, with high hopes and a high sense of mission. Belgium said: ttMil lions of men and women have their eyes fixed on us. This is an opportunity which perhaps will never return. It is our duty not to deceive all those who hope." And Peru: (CAS progress is a continuous struggle we must exert ourselves so that progress may unfold within a friendly pattern." And the Philippines:  "Let us make this floor the last battlefield.  We are, here to determine whether the human race is going to exist. Technicalities can be ironed out — of more lasting importance is the spiritual structure." 

 And Nicaragua: "The supreme effort is an effort of the spirit." 

 The days and weeks went by. The Conference  weathered crisis upon crisis, and often the man in the street wondered whether it would not disintegrate with nothing accomplished. 

 Meanwhile the twelve committees of experts labored day and night; slowly the work went forward, and as a Liberian official commented, it was as if the delegates were moved by a power higher than themselves. 

 Often the public sessions were long and slow and dull; there was almost a factory quality in the Opera House those days as section after section of the Charter was assembled. 

 The audience drifted in and, discouraged  by the long talks in foreign languages  or by technical discussions that were equally foreign, drifted out. 

 It was hot and the air smelled of burning paint from the hot Klieg lights and the cameramen and technicians wore their shirtsleeves. 

 The Conference procedure, however, was an art form. 

 An expert on this phase of the work was present at all times; he carried a

  paper-covered book entitled tA Guide to the Practice of International Conferences," and reportedly had difficulties because of the lack of precedents. To Baha, the dignity and courtesy of the participants were memorable,  and helped explain the emphasis placed by Baha'u'llah on courtesy in all our dealings. Certainly large-scale group activity of a complex nature cannot proceed without the discipline of supreme courtesy. 

 In manner, tone, expression, the delegates were usually exemplary; even in disagreement they were moderate, and there was a liberal use of courtesy  titles — t tMr. 

 Chairman, Sir, the honorable delegate, my esteemed colleague And they were working under new and unnatural conditions; for instance the Chinese had to coin fifty new words during the Conference,  the Arabs had trouble translating "national sovereignty" and the 

French ~~peace-loving      

 nations," the Steering Committee  spent two hours debating whether to title the first chapters ccpurposes and Principles"  or "Principles and Purposes." 

 As the Charter formed there were many references to the United States Constitution and the fact was emphasized that within four years of its adoption, ten vital amendments were made. The delegates began to feel that at least in the Charter they had an effective beginning and that their work would be ttprogressivcly modified." 

 Of the American hemisphere, Peru said: "In the Spanish language a great Argentinian said, tAmerica for Humanity.'" And among many references to justice, Canada: '~Justice is the common concern of mankind." And a reference to force, by Mexico: 'tForce must be an exclusive instrument of the community of nations." Mexico also said that this is "a time when destiny calls us to the fullness of international life." And of human  nature, Syria: "We don't expect to change human nature — all we need do is draw out of it the best that is in it." And of the Covenant of the League, often referred  to, South Africa: "It was a great and noble effort, much in advance of anything that had been done or even attempted before  in its day it registered a great and real advance. Alas, the Covenant was oniy a milestone; this new Charter may also prove to be oniy a milestone. The fram. 

 en of the last peace lived in a political world, they thought a political solution would suffice. 

 ." And of women, BraziL: "This is the first time in international affairs that women have had a full and entire collaboration." 

 China said: "The work here is oniy setting up the machinery. How it can work depends on governments and peoples, not merely on this very dignified and sacred Charter." And Ecuador: "ilk years to come the world will not ask how long we were in San Francisco, but with what wisdom and imagination we built there for the future." 

 Toward the end there was an upsurge of enthusiasm and Panama said: "This Organization  is going to be the government of the world!" And the Netherlands, cautious: '~This new system legalizes the mastery of might. 

 We hope; we trust that the future will justify our hopes." And New Zealand, commenting on the fact that at this time, it was a choice between this organization  or no organization at all: ~ am sure in every impulse of my heart that the better course was followed; for the world could never understand the intricacies of voting principles, but only that once again mankind had come together, and failed. Debate  was free; it ran the gamut. ." 

El Salvador said: "We      

 came here to build something  — whether a palace or a hut; a structure — however humble a structure. 

 We are all going to give it our support in spite of the fact that it goes very short of the expectations of many of us." There was an affirmation from India that should not go unnoted: ecUlti U the essential  purpose will be gained some are suggesting that reference to Providence should not be introduced into the Charter. How can any of us for a moment consider that it is not the Hand of Providence that has brought us together? I am one of those who believe that it is Providence that is shaping our ends. Providence is behind all delegates and all conferences. 

 His will is above the wills of all powers, great or small." 

 They ratified the San Francisco Charter at the ninth plenary session after nine long weeks of struggle. The mood that evening was informal and relieved. The House was lammed again, and there was still the high sense of mission of the first day, although

  hope and fear had given way now to realization. 

 The big powers had laid a basis for cooperation among themselves, and had assumed  a primary responsibility for keeping the peace; regional arrangements had been geared to the global organization; there was the General Assembly, a center for the mobilization  of world opinion; the Economic and Social Council bad received important fact-finding and consultative functions; one purpose of the organization was to be the promotion of human rights "without distinction  as to race, sex, language, or religion." 

The Trusteeship Council    

 for Dependent  Territories was bound to recognize the paramount interests of the governed; there was the International Court of Law continuing the international organ for justice  set up under the League of Nations; best of all, perhaps, there was the Preamble, worded, as the Philippines representative said, so that we may hope to find an answer in the hearts of humanity." 

 When they were about to vote, the Chairman  emphasized the historic value of the act by saying; "In view of the world importance of this vote, it would be appropriate to depart from the usual method of raising one hand — if you felt with me I would ask the leaders of the delegations to rise and remain standing during the vote on an issue likely to be as important an issue as any of us in our life are ever likely to vote about." People in the galleries leaped to their feet, to look down at the delegates in the orchestra,  but subsided again at the cries of "Sit down!" from their fellows. There was silence, filled with flash bulbs and the spinning of the cameras and then, at the vortex of enormous applause, every one of the fifty delegation heads had risen. 

 Hour after hour the next day, they signed the United 

Nations Charter. What      

 the world saw was the blue drapes, the circle of flags on their white standards, the two great books open on the table, the correct young men wordlessly assisting the delegates and staffs. But all this was only an oasis, like a movie set, in the midst of chaos — men in shirtsleeves swarming up and down scaffolding, rows of half-empty Coca-Cola bottles on the newsreel men's platform, news photographers  and members of the press lounging here and there, a voice coming over a loud speaker, and permeating everything, the hbt paint smell from the Klieg lights. One following  another, the delegations came in; the chairman and others signed, the pen flashing gold in the bright sunshine of the spotlight; flanked by his staff, the Chairman smiled, spoke a few words for the newsreels, led the way out. At last the quiet voice over the public address system announced: "Gtl will be the next and final nation  to sign." 

 When the third Guatemalan representative bad affixed his signature, vigorously  pumping the pen up and down, the Charter was accomplished. 

    The San Francisco Conference

 was of significance  to Baha'is in that, among other things, it emphasized the role of the United States in international peace, a function so often ascribed to her by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and that it proved, once again, that statesmen cannot change the human heart; for the life-giving  spirit that so many of the delegates invoked is not in man's gift. 

 History will assign the Conference its proper place; all we can say is this, that in the spring of 1945, over a billion members of the human race met through their delegates in San Francisco, and signed their names to a document, perhaps  immortal, which began: "W'e, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind,  and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and to promote social progress. And for these ends to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors, and to unite our strength and to insure that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples do hereby establish an international organization to be known as the United 

Nations."                  

  What the men and women of San Francisco  needed most, was something beyond themselves. 

 They needed a universal Power to refer to, beyond the powers that be; a single Point that each could turn to. It will

  take more than good will to bring world peace. 

 As some of the delegates said, only the spirit can achieve it. That spirit is in our Faith. 

 Perhaps we do not explain it very well, but it is fashioned of the tears of the Master and the chains of Baha'u'llah; of the bullets in the heart of the Bab; of the light from the candles burning in the wounds of IjAji Sulaym~n Kh6n as he walked to his death; of the smoke from the bonfire they made with the limbs of Qudd6s. 

  Golden Gate Park stretches westward along the Pacific, not many blocks from where the Conference met. There is a little lake here where 'Abdu'l-Baha sometimes liked to walk. A path winds round it, slipping  through sunlight and shade; it is back from the road, sheltered by siopes of pale hydrangeas. The path comes to a marble, pillared structure, like a small temple, set in dark trees; this was once the doorway of a San Francisco mansion, and later brought as a relic of the fire, to the edge of this lake. It is very quiet here, under the laurels and eucalyptus; wild rabbits feed in the clover, the lake streams away in the wind from the ocean, the sun drifts down, gold and dreamlike.  It is quiet and the presence of the Master seems very close, perhaps because He walked and prayed here during His brief moments of rest, and His beauty was mirrored  here. The memory of the words He spoke in San Francisco is very loud in the stillness: ~tThe age has dawned when human fellowship  will become a reality. 

 tcThe century has come when all religions shall be unified. 

 (CThe dispensation is at hand when all nons shall enjoy the blessings of International Peace. 

 ccThe cycle has arrived when racial prejudice will be abandoned. 

 ttThe epoch has begun wherein all nativities will be conjoined in one great human family. 

 t~For all mankind shall dwell in peace and security beneath the shelter of the one living God."

 THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD   
                           
IF OLLOWERS of Baha'u'llah  

 tell auda-ciousiy  in meetings large and small that a magnificent culture will be shared by all nations in this cycle. We tell how this new order of life and manners was called into being when the Holy Spirit became manifest and vocal in the Coming of Baha'u'llah almost a hundred years ago. 

 As we point out, ever since the Holy Prophet entitled the BTh (i.e., the Gate) summoned God's witnesses to the New Dispensation,  mankind has been worked upon by suffering and change to accept the newly revealed 'World Faith as ready soil does the seed. 

 In plain talk, the Baha'is realize that nationalism is dead. But, we are finding out, funnily enough, that public opinion and specialists have not yet admitted there was anything so final as a burial. Among the unconvinced  are a formidable number of cynics,  who hold that a planetary civilization would be nice but impossible. 

 Words from mortals cannot convince them that man will become decent. The type I cope with have no real convictions and never become tense: unexcitedly, without forfeiting a mite of charm, they declare the Baha to be unrealistic  or starry-eyed or equally awful things the proudly practical can bring out of their vocabularies whenever they try to fence in the free. 

 Perhaps the oniy thing they are sure of is this grand libidinous age they are seeing destroy itself. But I say there are too many moderns suffering from vacancy of soul. Cynics put themselves spiritually on the dole — yes, the sociable ones as well as the aloof —  inasmuch as they are leaving it to others to attain vision enough combined with courage and strength to carry the whole load towards the future. 

 Can anyone doubt the survival value of a high morale? 

 Whomsoever does not doubt it, owes it to all other men to rise with the unified collective will and get on with the job of the necessary world government. 

 For world reconciliation and government have been divinely intended for this century. More's the pity if men were created to work towards victory and yet fail to know Him by Whom it comes! 

 Already it has been said, "The horse gallopeth but the Rider is invisible." 
     More blessed are the witnesses!

 They are souis that willed to rise above the obvious, fix their attention for God and accept the gift of faith in the new Revelation. 

 God the All-mighty has sent Baha'u'llah to stand in His stead and start a civilization with a universal 

Holy Book.                 
                           
  THE TRANSFORMING POWER     

  Each one of the Verses of this newest Book secrets a wonder-working power. 

 Therein lies a transforming influence which can create in the devotee a new category of thought serving a universal purpose. 

 It has been attested that a single Verse has mended a broken life or made a timid soui speak out bravely. 

 This Revelation can raise us all from death to life; and, if you can believe it (or even if you can't) the process of compulsory world redemption is going on right now. Not every woman can decipher a pattern and visualize a frock before it is cut nor every man see a house built by taking in the plan of it. A country friend flatters us if he draws for our direction a map of highways  and crossroads leading to his home. 

 To grasp the action before it is done — ah, this demands the Unclouded Vision of 'Abdu'l-Baha. He has interpreted, by appointment from the Revelator Baha'u'llah, the divine Plan for World Commonwealth sent down from Heaven. In a threefold pattern of divine inspiration the science of world government has its Source.

  Those who will turn to 

'Abdu'l-Baha's Teachings   

 with unmixed minds and ready hearts will discover therein the fulfillment of their own true selves. 

 And that is because the modern's will for world citizenship and service itself has been generated by the 'Will and Word of God for the entire human race. Service is the shortcut to self-realization or redemption in this compelling hour. 

 The Word is the bearer of the Spirit that redeems from separateness and unites with the whole. 

 By The Word is intended the speaking of God embodied as the Prophet. The creative Word will accomplish what mortals cannot do just by talking. 

 We claim that a worldwide acceptance of Baha'u'llah would work a spiritual change from within outwards whilst His divine plan for one World Community is now at work from without inwards. And that all lesser plan —  fling will break down because either the inner or the outer change is wanting. 

 Already some former cynics have been transformed while giving their attention to the Baha'i Teachings. 

 They heard, read, prayed, yielded and came into the living organism  of the World Community. They acknowledge  the appointed Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, in his station of guidance and spiritual  leadership. 

 And now they are so changed — so thoroughly "born again" — that it is as hard for them to recapitulate the life they followed as woridlings as it would be for any of us to relate his prenatal experience.  And, perhaps, even less interesting. 
                           
   THE TABLETS To JArAN       

  Through the gate of remembrance comes the image of Doctor George Augur, th~ nineteenth "Herald of the Covenant." 

 He opened Japan for the Cause. His ministrations healed bodies and prepared souls to receive 'Abdu'l-Baha's Letters. This immortal pioneer adopted the Japanese psyche: that is to say, he spoke the language, lived in a Japanese house, wore the formal kimono, and chose the serene canon of taste which consists in putting away all treasures saving but one point of contemplation — such as a rose, a vase, book or bibelot. 

 Have you not seen an orange booklet of the nineteen Tablets to Japan? 'Abdu'l-Baha addressed the first of the series in 191 6. The last is one giving recognition "to the new friends of Korea" and is dated early in the month of His departure from earth. So these Letters seem to be a last munificent gesture — as it were, the rounding out of His earthly mission. 

 When first they came to my hand it was nineteen years ago, on our wedding trip, spent among the varied peoples in Hawaii. Although Baha'i life puts no strain upon one to accept the fellowship of differentiated peopies inasmuch as friendship comes easily from out the paramount sense of the essential  oneness of mankind, for me, and even while bowing to their talents, the Japanese had remained an enigma. The Spanish' half of me whispered that the selfcontained presence with which they faced the world must be persona or what is defined psychologically as the collective masque. 

 Their poised and somewhat detached mien, preciseness and quaint mysteriousness was baffling. For whenever one can see the light and shadow of a human personality — that is to say, ttthe nine good points and the one bad" — then one knows where one stands in relatedness. "How are they, really?" I wanted to know. ttAd what is the individuality restrained by the aesthetics of their every day life?" 

 No ready answer was given in my quandary by the Japanese as we sipped tea and talked. Even though our chitchat went on and on, I felt more than a little bit gauche before their smooth and ceremonious behavior. The easy way out would have been to think no more about it. And that is also the way to forfeit a share in the mutually communicative experience the civilized are always  groping for here below. 

 There are times when one's questions are never answered and yet they cease to be germane because they have been transcended. Human relations can be lifted to a plane higher than psychology. And that happened under the yoke which Heaven put between us with the aforementioned Tablets. 

 For 'Abdu'l-Baha did understand the Japanese.  He knew them — as He knew all chil-. dren of the Most High God. 

 One sees a child not as he is, but knows the child is as he will be. And that is how 'Abdu'l-Baha foresaw the destiny of a people and paid for


<p686>
686             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  us all a tribute to the spirituality of the Japanese. 

 It was to a young girl in Tokyo that He wrote three of the series. 

 He addressed her, ~ thou beloved daughter!" and declared that in their kinship of hearts the East and the West embraced. 

 Furthermore, He wrote: "The enlightened peopie of Japan are tired and disgusted with the superannuated and putrified blind imitations. 

 They are assured that these blind imitations are pure superstitions without any truth "The people of Japan are like unto a soil that has been deprived of rain for centuries and generations and has had no share of the outpouring of rain and even of dew "Such a soil as this has great capacity. One seed produces a hundredfold." 

 But my husband's bond with the Japanese had begun the way of positive knowledge. That is not from hearsay or through the exponents of limited causes, who fancy they ought to prove themselves as sovereign personalities. 

 They tend to regard other breeds of men as inferior in order to introduce themselves as champions of a sectarian religion  or an exclusive commerce and civilization. 

 (Oh, I once heard a shining black preacher lament because too many Christians behave as if all life is fixed into categories of race, creed and property, and what is more, as if it had crystallized at a moment  advantageous to themselves!) But I am almost forgetting to tell that my husband's first orientation was taken on the basis of human interdependence and began while he was tied to the back of the laundress in the style of family life in Hawaii. 

 Of the Japanese nationalistic code as exhibited  in war and diplomacy he had nothing to say then or now. (And I also am leaving to specialists a diagnosis of the disease of national self-interest that can lead any nation to put the worst foot forward.) It was the traditional virtues that he remembered: the oldfashioned Japanese demonstrated their singlemindedness and hard work, demanded frugality of themselves and yet were generous to others. They had reverence for learning and showed some precocity in reaching for it. And, always, in everything courtesy. 

 Baha'u'llah has named courtesy or reverence  as Ctthe lord of all virtues" and "a sign" that exists in those of spiritual rank: "But this virtue is assigned to a few; for all are not endowed with this station." So with this Verse — explained my husband — the predilection of his youth became something else, indeed, one of "the relationships that nothing can shake." 

 The new dimension of significance is created by the Word. 

 Through time, space and the unknown I reach for the hand of that first Japanese on native soil to bear witness for Baha'u'llah. He was a lad at school in Toyko in 1915 when he sent this testimony of faith to 'Abdu'l-Baha, writing in Japanese on a scroll: "Although I am a base and poor youth in this world, I have been awakened and bathed in the ocean of Thy mercy and am so happy that I pity the king and the prince who are wandering about in the dream of temporal variance. 

 Accept, 0 Master, my deep thankfulness  from the bottom of the heart. 

 I am very sorry though, when I think of our fellow men who take no thought of real happiness and do not rely upon the warm hand of Thy love. 

 0 my Lord, water me forever from the fountain of Thy mercy; I will never refuse Thy command whatsoever it may be. Forgive my sins and allow me to awaken my fellow men. 

 Can anyone send inc from the annals of the petitioners a more moving appeal? 

 It stirred the heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha and He wrote in reply: ttThe Most Great Guidance is a crown the brilliant gems of which will shine upon all the future ages and cycles. If it is placed on the head of a servant, he will become the object of the envy of Kings, for this is an imperishable crown and an everlasting sovereignty. 

 God says in the great Qur'an, He particularizes with His Mercy whomsoever He desireth." 

 In the same Letter 'Abdu'l-Baha charges the student to be mindful of the Gospel precept, ttFreely ye have received, freely give." To practice it he should give to others the Baha'i Message, for which he has paid nothing and for which no payment shall be made to him.

  Preciousness is the characteristic of another Japanese witness. 

 This lad was wanting in eyesight — but not in insight — and he began with this salutation: ~ my 'Abdu'l-Baha whose image so calm and peaceful I dreamed of and it cannot be effaced from my heart. 

 ttj confess to Thee that my heart sometimes  withers iike a flower in the day of summer, and loses its whole strength, nevertheless, my beloved Lord, give to me power that I can throw away every kind of prejudice  and ignorance from my heart. Make my heart as pure and fresh as green grass from the spring pastures and let my soul grow more and more by Thy shower of Mercy!" 

 And to this 'Abdu'l-Baha replied: ~ will become illumined. 

 Do ye strive as hard as possible in order to be attracted to the Beauty of the Beloved of the World, and through the fire of His love inflame that Kingdom." 

 The Japanese minister to Spain, Viscount Arawaka, together with the Viscountess received  'Abdu'l-Baha at the Hotel d'Jena in Paris in 1911. The interview is recorded in Lady Blomfield's memoirs entitled "The Chosen Highway." To the diplomatist 'Abdu'l-Baha gave the elements of a rounded and progressive economy and concluded with the following warning: "Scientific discoveries have increased material civilization. There is in existence a stupendous force, as yet, happily, undiscovered  by man. 

 Let us supplicate God, the Beloved, that this force be not discovered by science until spiritual civilization shall dominate the human mind. In the hands of men of lower material nature, this power would be able to destroy the whole earth." 

 Later, addressing nine persons, eight of whom were young men studying in Tokyo, He wrote the Letter published in the 

Tablets to Japan:         

 "In Japan the divine proclamation will be heard as a formidable explosion, so that those who are ready will become uplifted and illumined by the Light of the Sun of Truth." 
                          
    AMOK VINCIT OMNIA         

  Modern souls are like jigsaw puzzles. Some of them are complex and others are devious. 

 It looks as if there had been tossed into the jumble of their fragmentary selves a lot of cu-cu, which doesn't even belong to them. on their own, but is the trademark of their set. If the extraneous bits are discarded and the missing parts are found, they can be integrated. 

 When a human personality can get straightened out it attains simplicity. 

 Nor is any price too great to pay to be rid of extraneous traits and the attendant confusion.  The death of prejudices and fanaticism falls as grace and deliverance, for the self that survives the reshaping now has depth, warmth and fragrance. 

 Although the latter may be too subtle for analysis, still it proves itself by an inimitable spiritual attraction. 

 There are souls which needed only a touch of the Master's hand to integrate their being. When one of them is thus rounded out, his individual pattern curves into the larger pattern that encircles the East and the 'West. 

 Meanwhile, each one of us is spending himself for that which he loves. 

 In the measure that the artist is capable of loving beauty he will pursue it and express himself creatively; the scientist, loving truth and order, will discover it; and the servants of the Almighty, loving Him, will not cease to gravitate towards His 

Manifestation.            

 On the great prairies of Canada we recently met a Japanese Baha'i. 

 In the middle of his life and for God alone he had asked for repatriation. 

 It was the legal way opened for him to return to his native land and take part in its resuscitation. 

 To meet our question as to how he had become a Baha'i, he told that be had shared the sequestration of aliens in Canada during the war. Afterwards, while passing through Regina, another Japanese informed him that he, the latter, had identified himself with the World Faith and Community. Whereupon, the traveller replied that he did not consider religion useful in the contemporary problem, adding, ~ am an atheist with Buddhistic ethics." 

 (After all, he had preserved something from the Message of the Great Enlightener!) 

 Here the Regina friend suggested that they should speak no more about it lest their conversation become strained. Instead, he pledged the traveller, upon his return to


<p688>
688            THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Winnipeg, to call upon the Chairman of the Baha'i Spiritual Assembly and ascertain from him the Claim to be investigated. 

 Precisely this the traveller did. Upon his own statement, be acted without enthusiasm, solely from courtesy, lest he make a breach of confidence with his friend. 

 However, in the first interview, by the inexorability of logic, he perceived the validity  of the spiritual and humanitarian principles of the promised World Order. And, quite after that, he accepted their Revelator as an Ambassador from Heaven and God as the Unknowable One Who had sent Him. 

 In this new stature he has sailed for Japan. From Vancouver Pierhead he sent to his mother Community of Winnipeg this farewell: "Dear Baha'i friends: Here I am at the Pacific Coast awaiting to leave for Japan. The boat that will take us across is in front of me. I deeply breathe the fragrance of sea air and look at the beautiful seagulls leisurely  flying high and iow over our heads and the harbor as if they were seeing us off with a friendly Bon Voyage. 

 "Though I may be gone six thousand miles away from you, my heart will always cover the distance with the speed of light. 

 I appreciate  so much your acquaintance. Sweet memories of my dear Baha'i friends shall long be cherished. 

 (CO Canada! the second home of my life —  I bid thee farewell from the bottom of my heart. In this seemingly sentimental moment  my mind is miraculously calm — I know not why! Dear Baha'i friends, the vast expanse  of the ocean is before me and my life likewise is facing the vastness of an uncertain  future. 
God alone knows my fate.  

 But I am going to accept whatever He chooses for me and endeavor to fulfill my wish and responsibility. 

 I am leaving Canada with a light heart and sincerely wishing you all a good health and all the happiness. 

 May God bless you and the Baha'i Cause." 

 As the repatriates were held under the rules of war, the Vancouver friends were not permitted to go on board. However, the authorities did allow a letter to reach him. And he received in sacred friendship that letter telling him the local Baha'is would look upon the ship from afar — even as the pilgrims once gazed upon the walls of the prison that kept from them the Blessed Beauty, Baha'u'llah. 

 This Cause is vast and at times mysterious. Recurrently its seasoned workers are levelled in humility by the realization that their own pet schemes for it are not acceptable in the Higher Plan. For this Cause grows by the organic processes of its own being and can raise up from out of the dust atoms that are useful to it. For the transforming power is ever at work. It lies within the offices of the Holy Spirit to make captives of us all — not all at once, but just a few in the beginning and these distributed among the nations. Resistance and ambivalence notwithstanding, the love of God is going to dominate mankind. 

 A boundless by comes with understanding  that God has not abdicated, but is conscious  of us and communicating His Will today. 

 The iove of God is a historical force and is verified by our ancestral testimony down the ages, but it ought to be something far more potent than that. 

 Even as the Baha'is affirm, God did speak through Muhammad,  and through Christ, and before that through Moses — assuredly — then and more immediately, God is revealed through Baha'u'llah. 

 The World Saviour is Baha' —  u'lUh because He is the Mediator of the Holy Spirit bearing enough redemptive power to recreate the entire human race. 

 The efficacy of divine love depends upon our being God-conscious  in our own Day. 
                          
  ONE WORLD AND ROUNDED     

  When the navigators proved the earth is round they didn't make it so. It already was, you know, and yet that fact of existence has a creditability of less than five hundred years. 

 When the Holy One, less than one hundred  years ago, revealed the world of humanity  as a oneness and roundness, He didn't make it so. The Creator intended it to become so from the beginning, nonetheless,  this fact of being has scarcely any creditability at all. 

 But this will become a universal corpus of thought linked with the acceptance of God as the Creator of all His peoples.

  Then the oneness of mankind shall be incontestable because the disappearance of all prejudices based on race, nation or class will leave only the singleness of the human creation. 

 And the roundness because there will be no minorities problem anywhere after all have been accepted as contributors within the ascending curve of a world culture. 

 Then the oneness of religion will prevail inasmuch as the various sacred Scriptures revealed throughout the past no longer will be expounded as the flat and narrow truth, but, rather, as valid aspects of One Truth. And the roundness because that one Truth of universal religion is whole and, therefore, encircling all its parts. 

 When the light of the one World Faith begins to move through the compartments of living that moderns now separate into art, science, industry and government, it will unify these separatenesses and perfect them into the harmonics of one planetary culture. The oneness, wholeness and roundness of that culture shall be reflected in the shape of all things to come. 

 And when the gawky angles of the world man is outgrowing shall have been integrated, molded and rounded into gracefulness and power, then we shall know humanity's adolescence is ended and its maturity is ful —  filled. 

 Again do I hear a friendly cynic asking, CtDoes anybody really know that?" Go, if you must, go and ask the earth if it has not been larded with bodies all made of one and the same substance? Or hear from the ranks of men and women submerged within the nations telling that sorrow and death anywhere  leads to sorrow and death-everywhere. rywhere. Ask the Japanese nation if the princes in their "embroidered robes" did nor come down from their high places and make a lamenta-don  for "the great city situated at the entry of the sea?" 

 And find out if some of their dead did not so much cease breathing as themselves were dissolved into the very breath of the wind invisible over

God.                       

 And you — whoever you are — you know it.   To all of us there is left but one mature question. 

 And this is it: why do we not act as if we knew it? From this hour forward, by His grace, we shall.

             THE MEETING OF THE AMERICAS

               B~ PHILIP LEONARD GREEN

  THE honor of speaking in this beautiful House of Worship during the centenary of the Baha'i Faith which it so fittingly symbolizes  and upon a subject so close to the hearts of its leaders, is fraught with great spiritual significance. 

 My first contact with the ideals promoted by this worldwide community of devoted men and women came almost two decades ago through the late Mary Hanford Ford, who presented me with a booklet entitled The World of 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Expecting to find in it little more than an interesting explanation of Oriental mysticism, I was overcome with surprise to read not only the exposition of a philosophy which exalted international cooperation to the status of a religion but which even made specific prophecies with regard to inter-American developments,  which have since become largely transformed into reality. These were all the more significant when we realize by whom and in what times they were given to the world. They came from the lips of a Persian mystic who could have had po special interest in singling out the Pan-American movement for preferential mention. 

 He made them in 1912, during a period when relations between the American republics. were rapidly degenerating. The interview

  Mr. Philip Leonard Green, guest speaker of the program "The Meeting of the Americas," May 24, 1944. The subject of his address was CCHit ial Backgrounds of American Unity." 

  during which these prophecies were promulgated  was reported in these words: ttSo he said there would be in the end a United States of the World, as compact as the present  United 

States of America." When   

 asked if this change would appear suddenly, he said, no, that it would arise first in the western continent. 

 The bond between North and South America would be greatly strengthened, he declared, and later, the entire  two continents, including Mexico and Canada, would grow so harmonious that they would act upon all important questions like one country. 

 These words could almost be mistaken for those of an enthusiastic Pan-Americanist. Sincere workers in the cause of inter-Amer-ican  concord can find in them that spiritual strength which they need at every turn on the long road to genuine amity which we in the Americas still have to travel. They lift the mission of the true inter-Americanist far above the shifting sands of arrangements built solely on material convenience. 

 They bring a sense of worthwhileness and assurance even when the forces of cynicism, hardheartedness and ineffectuality tend to engulf us. They point out in crystal-clear terms to

  Americans of the South, Center and North, the cosmic mission which has been reserved for them if they can but grasp its meaning and meet its requirements. 

 The first and foremost among these conditions  — one which is far from fulfillment at this time — is a genuine intellectual and spiritual understanding even among that portion  of the American nations capable of such understanding. 

 The magnitude of attaining such a goal is enough to discourage most of those who contemplate this task. Yet the pursuit of the Pan-American ideal antedates the establishment of the first free American republic. 

 At the Battle of Savannah, eight hundred volunteer troops from Haiti fought alongside the English colonists. 

 Again, it was President P6rion of Haiti who supplied the great Liberator of northern South America,  with valuable assistance in the struggle for 

Venezuelan freedom. Bolivar

 referred to P&ion as "the author of our liberties." 

 Another example of inter-American cooperation  was given by that other great figure of Latin American history, the Argentine  General, Jos6 cle San Martin, who was instrumental in freeing both Chile and Peru. Various forefathers of the Latin American republics had broad visions of inter-Ameri-can  unity in the earliest days of their national  life. 

 Among these were the distinguished  Honduran intellectual, Jos6 Cecilio del Valle and the Argentine 

Bernardo Mon-reagudo.      

 The former published a plan which he called "Federation of all the states of America" in his paper Amigo de Li 

Patria at Guatemala City   

 as early as 1822. The latter was the author of another comprehensive  blueprint for inter-American union, which is said to have had a profound effect on the thinking of Sim6n Bolivar. 

 These were but a few in the galaxy of early Latin American protagonists of the Pan-American cause. 

 In our own country, they bad their counterparts in such distinguished figures as Thomas Jefferson, 

James Monroe, John Quincy  

 Adams and, of course, the great Henry Clay, whose name is perhaps more widely known in Latin America than in his own land. For ten long years, Henry Clay fought almost single — handedly on behalf of recognition for the newly arising Spanish-American erican nations. He was one of the first leaders in our country to call attention to the cultural attainments of Latin Americans. First, in the common struggles for their political independence and then in the common dangers of their early national existence, the young republics of America found bonds of brotherhood which strengthened them in days of stress. 

 The Monroe Doctrine, a warning to non-American nations against further encroachments  on the American Hemisphere, became upon its declaration a rallying point for inter-American unity, a far cry from the symbol of imperialism into which it was later converted by a long list of errors. The Doctrine in its original form received a most cordial welcome from many Latin American political leaders. It was only in later years, when it became confused with other ideas which followed in its wake, that Latin Americans began to suspect the United States of sinister motives. 

 That this sus —  picion had ample basis is a long train of unhappy events, no impartial student of in-ter-American  affairs would now deny. The acquisition of onehalf of Mexico's territory by the United States, the exploits of the filibuster William Walker in Central America, the Panama Canal incident, the tendency of our leading statesmen during a certain era to speak glibly of our "manifest destiny" and the unfair exploitation of Latin American  peoples by certain of our fellow-citizens to whom profits meant more than the good name of their own country, were just a few of the causes that operated against the promotion  of inter-American friendship over many years. 

 Under these conditions, can we be surprised that Latin Americans increasingly referred to the United States as the "Octopus of the North" rather than in terms of admiration such as they had used in the time of Henry Clay? 

 You may naturally ask how much of this feeling of distrust remains at the present time. I wish I could tell you that it has been completely eliminated. Unfortunately, such is not the case and we might as well know it and face it. Professional Good Neighborism may in part save the day in wartime, when self-preservation leaves no other course open but cooperation; but huge

  expenditures of money in themselves will never achieve the kind of friendship which we must have in the Americas if we are to assume a unique mission. 

President Avila Camacho   

 of Mexico recently expressed the concern of most Latin American leaders when he said "The Good Neighbor Policy will lose all of its historical meaning if we look at it only as an instrument of Pan-American conciliation in the moment of danger." 

 There is no happy prospect for the endurance  and growth of a movement that is built on negative motivations. Upon the close of the present war, a sharp decline in Pan-American effort is bound to set in unless we refuse now to lose our perspective under the unusual stresses of war and uniess we determine to hold fast to the tenets of unadulterated,  Bolivarian Pan-Americanism. For this ideal has nothing whatsoever to do with the type of synthetic friendship which is superinduced temporarily by spending fantastic  sums of money. 

 The type of Pan-American friendship which Bolivar and all the other great Pan-American leaders envisioned  cannot be bought that way. The exchange of material things may have a large part in it but in the last analysis, it cannot be attained except through the operation of spiritual forces. 

 Bolivar first sensed this, when, as an exile on the island of Jamaica in the year 1815, he sent out his famous letter, frequently referred to as the Prophetic Letter, in which he expressed the hope that one day Panama might be for the New World what Corinth had been for the Old. Eleven years passed before his vision of a congress of the Americas  began to take shape with the small but famous gathering at Panama. To practical-minded people, the Bolivarian Congress of 1 826 was beyond doubt a failure. 

 Yet the seeds of subsequent inter-American cooperation were sown there. They were nurtured at a number of international Latin-American gatherings that followed, though at one time the very existence of the inter-American ideal was threatened. 

   Finally, the Pan-American 

 movement was given substantial impetus when Secretary of State James B. Blame of the United States brought together the delegates of the Amen can republics in 1899, at what was to be the first in a long series of international conferences, the eighth of which was held at Lima, Peru, in 1938. Some of these were characterized by acrimonious debates on sundry issues; others were the springboards for many a constructive effort. 

 At the very first of these gatherings, the American republics organized an international  office which later became known as the Pan-American Union — the first practical  approach to a working society of nations  in the history of the world. Started as a unit for the compilation and publication of economic data only, the Pan-American Union of today is an institution that serves such widely differing interests as agriculture, labor, music and travel. Aside from the Pan-American  Union, a number of specialized organizations have been set up by the American  republics at their various general and technical conferences. 

 Among these are the American Institute for the Protection of Childhood, the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, the 

Inter-American Commission 
of Women, the Inter-American

Radio Office, the Inter-American 
TradeMarks Bureau, the   

Pan-American  Highway     
Confederation, the Pan-American 
Institute of Geography    

 and History,  the Pan-American Railway Committee and the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau. Re-cendy,  the 

Inter-American Institute  

 of Agricultural  Sciences was organized. Since about two-thirds of the peopie of the Americas derive their living from agriculture in one form or another, it is quite evident that an organization which is intended to serve as a channel for mutual helpfulness in solving common problems can contribute in no small measure to the type of rapprochement that has a sound basis. 

 Supplementing these organizations is a rather intricate network of treaties and commissions  for the conciliation and arbitration of disputes that may arise in the Americas. Though it must be admitted that they have not always succeeded in avoiding conflict, no one will deny that the record of the Americas in this regard can still be considered  as exemplary. 

 Governmental machinery alone, however, will not guarantee the ultimate triumph of

 Official effort must be ably supplemented by enlightened cooperation on the part of the people. 

 To this end, it is highly important that the tools for marshalling and dispensing the information  so necessary to such understanding, be forged and kept in good working order. In this connection, it is to the credit of the schools, colleges, universities, libraries, museums  and professional organizations of the American republics that they have taken up the cause of inter-American understanding with so much interest and zeal. 

 Business associations, labor organizations, teachers' associations, student leagues, learned societies, women's associations, political and religious bodies, the press and the radio have also seen a new vision of usefulness in recent years through bringing the message of inter-American friendship to their constituencies.

 affairs whose interest goes back beyond the heyday of war-begotten enthusiasm for things Latin American, cannot forget that until about seven years ago, the spiritual descendants of Henry Clay in the United States could be counted in three figures if indeed three figures  were needed. 

 Now, in the general confusion of values aggravated by war, these devoted trail blazers frequently find the basic significance of their longtime dedication to the inter-American ideal obscured by newcomers, many of whom three or four years ago would have had difficulty in locat —  ing Latin America on the map, assuming that they had even been interested. 

 Under such conditions, it takes a peculiar brand of courage to keep one's faith. The spiritual nourishment which such groups as yours can make available is of supreme im

 It can bring to the true guardians of the inter-American cause the inescapable truth that they must not consider their movement as a casual, detached  effort in the realm of human association only, but rather, as part of a vast plan having far greater significance than any individual or group of individuals. 

 The goal of inter-American amity is one that has ever required untold sacrifices of those who chose to pursue it honorably. 

 There is nothing in past experience to warrant the assumption that it will be attained by peopie who are indifferent to the higher disciplines it de.-mands. 

 Fortunately, in every Am6rican nation  there is already a small group of effective people thoroughly convinced of the path which the Americas must follow in the challenging days ahead and ready to act in accordance with their beliefs at the appointed time. 

 It is only because of this that we can dare to assert our supreme confidence in a future day, when, under God, the Americas will stand truly united, both for their own welfare and in unselfish service to all fflan-kind.

             SOCIAL BASIS OF WORLD UNITY

                   B~ ELSIE AUSTIN

  TODAY, people who seek to stress the spiritual basis of peace and justice among men, or who dare to accent the necessity for the regeneration of human hearts and characters as the first step to needed social change, are usually rebuffed by those who immediately cry out, "Oh, you must be practical and realistic." 

 This is because so many folk think that the oniy practical approach to human problems  is one which deals immediately with outward evidences of what is desirable. 

 They do not see human needs beyond the specific projects devised for education and security. Outwardly these matters do represent the things which separate the ttHaves" from the tcHave Nots" in human society, and if you look at them in this light, they may seem to be the sole issues which have all along produced restlessness, division and strife among men. 

 However, any social program which is to operate for true world betterment must of necessity go beyond outward evidences, if it is to be really practical. 

 The best plans for social cooperation and peace are always limited by the kind of human beings who must use and apply them. There is no more realistic force in the world today than the Baha'i Faith. 

 In its teachings and its social program there are profoundly realistic ap proaches to the fundamental social changes which must be the basis of any real and lasting unity for mankind. 

 The Baha'i Faith is first of all a Faith which harmonizes the inward incentives and outward procedures to unity. Outward procedures give the means for unity and inward incentives give the heart for unity. 

 There is great difference between folk who have the means for unity and the folk who have the heart for unity. 

 Legislation and the interplay of conflicting  social interests may furnish a kind of means for unity, and even a certain state of outward compliance. 

 However, legislation and the pressures of expediency have never been able to get at the inward fears, jealousies,  greeds and animosities of men. And it is these which furnish the vicious inner motives which can browbeat the intelligence of men and make mockery of outward social compliance. Nearly every day we see tragic instances of failure where social change depends  upon means alone. Instances where people nullify and obstruct legislation, where they sabotage social effort or fail to produce and support the kind of courageous policies and action needed for the patterns and standards  consistent with just and enlightened ideals. 

 The means for unity is there, but legislation is killed or evaded; communities

  lose their moral integrity in compromise with policies of hatred and division, and people excuse themselves from honest upright action by saying, CCL is not the way to do this." "The time is not ripe" or CtThis is the right policy, but we must work up to it gradually." 

 Now, all such peopie are really saying  is, "I have not the heart to do this thing" or "The people whose opinion I fear have not the heart for forthright action about this, and I do not know how to reach them." 

 The religion of Baha'u'llah, founder of The Baha'i Faith, begins with that essential spiritual regeneration of the human being which creates a heart for brotherhood and impeL action f or the unity of mankind. Baha'u'llah has made it very plain that the test of Faith is its social force. 

 Principle and social planning are useless until they arc rendered dynamic by the stamina and will of men to enforce and apply spiritual ethics to human affairs. 

 The second great realism of the Baha'i faith is that it provides new patterns for the application of spiritual principle to the social problems of humanity. 

 When Baha'u'llah first proclaimed some eighty years ago, "This is the hour of the coming together of all the races and nations and classes. This is the hour of unity among the sons of men," the prophecy was a far fetched ideal to the world of jealous politics and cultural isolation which received it. But the unity of mankind today is no mere social ideal. Human strife has made it a social necessity. 

 It is not surprising then to see that human unity is an increasingly popular subject for liberal thought and action. Nor is it surprising  that programs to foster unity are being launched on every hand. 
Yet so many


<p696>

  of the bona fide efforts for unity are being fatally compromised because they must be launched through the established social patterns  which preserve old disunities. Do peo-pie learn brotherhood and the spiritual attitudes and social cooperation which brotherhood  involves by lectures or hesitant compromising  ventures, which leave untouched and unchanged the separate education, separate  worship, separate security, separate social  planning which shape every phase of their commuxiity living — embittering separations  made in terms of differences of race, creed, culture and nationality? 

 Any social pattern which elaborately preserves and accents  these outward differences and their resultant inward animosities mast of necessity  crucify the objective of social unity. 

 The Baha'i Teachings not only destroy without equivocation the fallacies which have nouAhed social strife and disunity, but they provide new patterns of social living and development through which men learn brotherhood by performance. 

 And what realistic way is there, you may ask, to deal with the ancient bitter diversities of race, religion and culture? 

 What can be done with the changing pressures of unstable  economics and the conflicting education of the world's peoples? 

 The Baha'i Faith provides for the diversities  of religion, that long needed center of reconciliation, which can produce harmonious understanding of its varying prophets and systems. 

 Baha'u'llah has shown us in the Baha'i Revelation that the great revealed religions of the world are like lamps which carry the pure light of Divine Truth providing  social teaching and discipline for humanity. But as that lamp is borne by human hands, there are periods when conflicting  interpretations of the Divine Word, dogmas and superstitions, alienate and divide  men. Periods when the temptations of material power pervert religion into an instrument for the exploitation and suppression  of human development. It is because of this that new lamps have always come and will always come. Each of the great lamps tests the social force of the others. 

 In this men should find source for progress, not reason for strife. 

 God in His mercy has provided  in the Divine Faiths a continuous and successive renewal of 

Universal Spiritual Truth.

 The Baha'i learns the relation and ordered unfoldment of Truth in all Divine 

Religions. Thus Spiritual 

 Faith is lifted above the period  differences of its various names and systems.  Is it unrealistic that in a world so in need of spiritual regeneration, Jews, Christians, Moslems and Believers of all Divine  Faiths should be given that which will relate their spiritual purposes and development  and thus enable them to travel harmo-rnousiy  a wide free path to greater social demonstration and understanding of the Truth? is this not a more effective way to create the heart for unity than the elaborate separations and the jealous fencing off of Religious paths? 

 Today men so preserve and concentrate upon their symbolic differences that the common goal is lost in confusion and animosity. 

 There are really no diversities of race to those who truly accept the fact that all mankind is God's creation. 

 Yet the outward differences of color, physiognomy and cul —  awe have annoyed and divided us. When members of the human family meet each other who have striking differences in appearance and manners, they resort very naturally to reactions of fear, distaste and derision, which grow out of the human complex  for conformity and the fear of strangeness. 

 Unity of mankind is not oniy a basic principle in the Baha'i Faith, but it is also the basis of a new social pattern in terms of which Baha'is worship, work, educate themselves and contribute their capacities to civilization. 

 Living in a Baha'i community is a matter of learning differences, appreciating them and achieving with them great loyalties to human welfare, which are above the narrow confinements of race, creed and class, color and temperament. 

 The most practical  knowledge in the world is the knowledge that the world can never become what so many people like to believe; a world in which we make other people look, act, and understand in terms of that with which we are familiar. 

 That kind of world is neither possible nor desirable. 

 What we really want is a world of harmonized differences, where a man can make his contribution with other men for the good of all mankind.

A growing Community which operates with every possible human difference to take into consideration, yet its members through practicing and perfecting their practice of the Baha'i Teachings, have achieved a unity of objectives through which entirely new social patterns, standards and virtues are being evolved. 

 People do not like to mention religion and economics in the same breath. The problem is that of the economically disinherited who in bitter restless upsurge change periodically the pressures and controls of this world's unstable economics. It is practical to talk of trade policies, of commerce regulations and spheres of influence, now. However, the world must soon face the fact that economic instability and the bitter struggle and suffering  which go on because of it, have a question of human motives, human development, behind them. Motives behind the failure to use opportunity, or the use of it to selfishly acquire and control wealth, goods, and serv —  ices, constitute the real factors causing the unhealthy inequalities, the exploitation and suppression in human society. Baha'u'llah stressed the need of a spiritual basis as the first step in the development of stable world economics. 

 The extremes of poverty and vast wealth are not oniy matters of material opportunity and education, they are also matters of greed and slothfulness in human characters. 

 Material education and spiritual enlightenment must be applied to bring the kind of economic adjustments which will make possible responsible efforts for all people and insure a just distribution of wealth, goods and services for all people. 

 Until then, we are all, regardless of our skins, creeds and countries, caught economically  between the evil extremes which are produced by the Jeeter Lesters and those masters of selfish financial genius, who, like a cancerous growth, feed upon and weaken the earth's human and material resources.

  Nothing but the wholesome regeneration of human hearts and establishment of new social objectives for the efforts and acquisitions of men, will in the final analysis remedy  these ills. 

 The great realisms of the Baha'i Faith lie in its new spiritual teachings and in the new social patterns which they provide for needed development of mankind; a development which will turn men from the beliefs and superstitions which are destructive to human solidarity and create in them the heart to initiate and perfect new standards,. new morals and new undertakings for a great new era of civilization. 

 These achievements are possible when man is afforded that perfect combination of Human  and Spiritual Unity. 'Abdu'l-Baha, the great expounder of the Baha'i Teachings, has described it in these words: "Human Unity or solidarity may be likened to the body, whereas unity from the breaths of the Holy Spirit is the spirit animating the body. This is a perfect unity. It creates such a condition in mankind that each one will make sacrifices for the other and the utmost desire will be to forfeit life and all that pertains to it in behalf of another's good. It is the unity which through the influence of the Divine Spirit is permeating  the Baha'is, so that each offers his life for the other and strives with all sincerity to attain His good pleasure. 

 This is the unity that caused twenty thousand people in IrTh to give their lives in love and devotion to it. It made the IB~b the target of a thousand arrows and caused Baha'u'llah to suffer exile and imprisonment for forty years. This unity is the very spirit of the body of the world."

  NO ONE can view the different phases of the truly remarkable expansion of the Babi'i Faith, during the hundred-and-two years since it was revealed in 1 844, without becoming aware of a recurring and unfailing rhythm which underlies the course of its development. Crisis after crisis has been literally  hurled upon its adherents, followed by triumph after triumph. 

 Periods of steady, constant growth have been interspersed with dramatic events in which the mighty force propelling this Cause of God has manifested new and greater powers, greatly accelerating its development and sweeping it forward to new stages in its unfoldment. 

 To such vitally important and definite milestones in the growth of the Baha'i Faith undoubtedly belongs the Centennial Celebration  held in Wilmette, Illinois, May 19th to May 24th, 1944, the full significance of which has become increasingly evident during  the two years that have elapsed since this historic oGcasion.

  ship, they had participated freely, in complete  unity and harmony with the other delegates from the North American States and Provinces of Canada, in the important deliberations and discussions of the Convention,  and had themselves taken a distinguished part in a practical and convincing demonstration of true equality without any distinction whatsoever of race, color, creed or class. With their horizons suddenly extended  far beyond their own local and sectional  interests, they found themselves concerned  with the welfare and progress of the Baha'i Community as a whole, and beyond the range of hemispheric solidarity, they caught a glimpse of the progressive unfoldment of the Divine Plan which in its final stage will be world-embracing, bringing peace, security, and spiritual wellbeing to all mankind. 

 It was highly significant, too, that it was not oniy with North American Baha'is, but with representatives of the other Latin American Republics, that they had shared in the highest type of democracy, based on the principles of their common Faith, and had witnessed convincing proof of the power of Baha'u'llah to dispel all national rivalries and hatreds and to unite His followers into one universal 

Administrative  Order.   

 Thus was a deeper bond of fellowship and understanding created between the countri&s of the Western Hemisphere, and a milestone of immeasurable importance reached, in the evolution of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. The delegates assembled from all of the Americas,  North, Central and South, turned homeward  with fresh inspiration, renewed dedication,  and firm resolve to carry ever forward the development and establishment of the Divine Plan, the pattern and certain unfoldment of which were now so clearly discernible. 

 To the members of their respective communities, they carried with them a new conception and. 

 realization of the greatness and universality of the Baha'i Faith, a clearer vision of its unfolding processes and of the hope and assurance it held for the whole world. 

 Through the participation of the Latin American representatives in the 

Centennial Celebration    

 and All America Convention, the Baha'i Faith throughout 

Latin America             

 had received a fresh and dynamic impulse, and turned a definite corner in its hemispheric  development. 

 In consequence, the scope of the Inter-America work promised to be so greatly increased that it became evident to the National Spiritual Assembly that the Committee charged with the responsibility of directing it should now be centered in its membership and activities in the Temple Area, where it could function in the closest relationship with the National Spiritual Assembly and with the offices of the National Treasurer and the Publishing Committee. 

 It was the highest testimony possible to the monumental achievements of the members of the retiring Inter-America Committee2 and to their devoted services, rendered often under very difficult conditions,  that the work to which they had given so untiringly of their strength and efforts, now demanded the immediate contact  with the highest administrative center in the Western Hemisphere. 

 It was with deepest appreciation and full recognition of the devotion and achievements of those who had been serving so valiantly, that the National  Spiritual Assembly appointed a new Inter-America Committee3, to begin functioning in October, 1944. 

 In a cable message sent July 17th to the National Spiritual Assembly in 

W'ilmette, the Guardian   

 said: ttRejoice success vitally needed timely conference Latin American representatives. 

 Greatly welcome decisions reached plans formulated. First year second IBahA'i century should witness (1) Establishment Spiritual Assembly every remaining republic and be signalized by (2) Steady increase pioneers both Latin (and) North America; (3) Further multiplication groups; (4) Wider dissemination Baha'i literature both

700             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Thus were clearly defined the immediate goals to be attained in the Inter-America teaching field and the roads along which these objectives should be pursued. Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela, still lacking Spiritual Assemblies, were to be the !!goal countries" of 19441945. 

 A steady increase  of Pioneers was imperative, to assist in the twofold process of consolidating the existing communities and in the establishment of Spiritual Assemblies in the seven remaining republics. Effective and immediate means had to be devised to assist the Latin American Committees, appointed as a result of the joint actions taken in the ttAll America Convention," in initiating their vital and all-important tasks of translating, publishing,  and disseminating the Baha'i literature. 

 Dr. Malcolm M. King, whose former devoted  efforts as Pioneer had resulted in the development of a Spiritual Assembly in Kingston, Jamaica, now graciously accepted the difficult post in Nicaragua, and departed  for Managua on November 11th. From Miami, on the 29th of the same month, Elisabeth Cheney, already experienced through former pioneering in Paraguay,  set forth for Venezuela, for a period of intensive teaching in Caracas, before proceeding South on other missions for the Inter-America Committee, including a prolonged  stay in Montevideo, to assist with the establishment of a Spiritual Assembly in Uruguay, another of the 'tgoal countries." 

 In Bolivia, Flora Hottes, continuing in her devoted and valiant service, was being assisted  in her efforts toward the development of the desired Spiritual Assembly in La Paz, by the experienced and invaluable help of Virginia Orbison. Later in the 

Fall (Novem-ber)  Miss     

 Orbison was transferred to Ecuador  to dedicate herself to the task of developing  the group in Guayaquil, then numbering six, into a Baha'i Community. 

 Almost on the day4 of her arrival in Ecuador, John Stearns, the first Pioneer to this republic, who had served so devotedly and for so long in that land, passed to the Abh4 Kingdom, in the midst of devoted friends in Lima, Peru. It was significant, indeed, that the successful 'November 7th. 1945. 

 accomplishment of the task assigned to the newest pioneer to Ecuador wa~ achieved by her building on the foundation already laid by the valiant first teacher in this country, and through the invaluable assistance of a member of a Latin American community. Haig 

Kevorkian, from Buenos     

 Aires, Argentina,  who had volunteered his services to the Inter-America Committee, arrived in Guayaquil in early April, in time to reinforce the Intensive teaching efforts of Miss Orbison, and to help in the formation of the historic first Spiritual 

Assembly in Ecuador.       
      Two other Latin American   

 Believers played vitally important parts in the establishment  of new 

Spiritual Assemblies       

 in 194445: Ofelia Montalvo, a native of El Salvador, after completing a course of study in the United States, offered herself as Pioneer  to the Dominican Republic; and Esteban Canales, a member of the Santiago, Chile, Community, serving as Pioneer to Punta Arenas, contributed richly to the teaching campaign which had been so effectively initiated  there by Mrs. Marcia Steward and continued by Artemus Lamb, both 

Pioneers from North America.

 In its turn, this Baha'i Community, formed in the Southernmost tip of South America, was to give its assistance to extension teaching in a third Chilean city, Valparaiso, an undertaking which was carried  on and developed under the auspices of the Assemblies of both Santiago and Punta Arenas. 

 En route to her new post in Venezuela in early March, 1945, Louise Baker, who had at one time served as Pioneer in Colombia, stopped over in Trujillo, Dominican Republic  to assist Ofelia Montalvo; and here again a "goal" Assembly resulted from the harmonious  and collective efforts of a Latin and a North American Pioneer. When the desired objective in Trujillo was assured, Miss Baker continued on her way to her final destination, Caracas, furnishing the group there with the fresh inspiration and timely help needed to bring to fruition, in the formation of the first Spiritual Assembly, the devoted and assiduous labors of the former 

Pioneer to Venezuela.

  and intensive ditection of the Inter-America Committee under the N. S. A., and above all, the loving appreciation and continued encouragement  and inspiration of the Guardian, reaped a rich harvest, for in the elections of April, 1945, the desired "first" Assemblies were established in Bolivia, Dominican Republic,  Ecuador, Panama, Uruguay, and Venezuela. 

 Nicaragua alone lacked the attainment  of this specific objective set forth in the Guardian's cable of July 17th, 1944, but even in this country the Cause had gained a great victory and won an essential prerequisite to the successful foundation later of a Baha Community. 

 With utmost tact and graciousness, Dr. King had gained access to Government officials, and after presenting the principal tenets of the Baha'i Faith, had succeeded in securing permission to promulgate  the Teachings with full liberty and freedom. 

 The Election Reports of 1945 brought further cause for thanksgiving and rejoicing in their announcements of additional new Assemblies in both Colombia and Chile. Through systematic and well-developed correspondence, in which the Baha'i Teachings were clearly presented and progressively unfolded,  Gerrard Sluter, a member of the Bogota Community, had brought enough interested  people to an understanding and acceptance  of the Faith to elect a Spiritual Assembly in both Mogotes and Contratacion, thus augmenting the number of Communities  in Colombia to three. In Punta Arenas, Chile, the concentrated efforts of the Pioneers  under the auspices of the Santiago Assembly had resulted in the development of the group there into a community with its own 

Assembly. To the National  

 Spiritual Assembly, in a message dated April 21, 1945, the Guardian expressed the very evident special joy and comfort which the firm establishment of the Cause in Magallanes (Punta Arenas), that far-flung corner of Chile, had brought him. "My heavily-la-dened heart," he wrote, "is relieved by latest signal evidence of the indomitable spirit of the members of divinely chosen American Baha'i community now unfurling the banner  of the Faith and establishing the structural  basis of its administrative order in the world's southernmost city. I hail the staunchness ess and fidelity distinguishing the winners of such superb victories. I acclaim them true brothers and sisters worthy of the name 'Abdu'l-Baha. I urge the Inter-America Committee to devote special attention and undertake prompt measures designed to increase the number of believers, establish local administrative headquarters, and multiply the subsidiary agencies indispensable to the maintenance of a flourishing community in the southern extremity of western hemisphere. 

 Praying ever increasing successes. 

 In a later communication, the Guardian likened the two communities of Punta Arenas  and of Anchorage, Alaska, to "the extremities of the Baha'i Arms stretched out and waiting to embrace the whole world in the order of peace and love." 

 With hearts deeply touched, the Spiritual Assembly of Anchorage immediately dispatched a loving and special greeting to the friends in the far-off land with which they had been so beautifully associated by the Guardian, accompanying  their message with the fitting gift of a lovely picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha, —  an incident, perhaps, but infinitely significant in its impressive demonstration of the love and unity generated by the operation of the Faith of Baha'u'llah and of the power of that Faith to dissolve separation and distance, creating in their stead a true oneness of spirit. 

 On April 30th (1945), the Inter-America Committee received the following heartening cable from the Guardian: "H tf It congratulations  superb achievement Inter-Amer-ica Committee opening year second Baha'i century. 

 Advise concentrate attention (1) Formation assembly one remaining republic, Nicaragua; (2) Consolidation newly fledged Assemblies; (3) Multiplication groups throughout

702            THE BAHA'! WORLD

  following July, the objectives to be attained during 19451946. Because of the special emphasis which had been placed, in the year just completed, on the establishment of the seven Spiritual Assemblies still lacking, the Inter-America Committee had been compelled to concentrate its attention and direct the work of its Pioneers to the achievement of these specific goals. 

 With the desired Assemblies now formed in all but one of the Latin American Republics, the Committee was able to focus its efforts on the strengthening of Communities which had been formerly  established, but which were undergoing the trying problems so often encountered by young Assemblies in the process of strengthening their foundation and of developing their administrative functions. To assist in just such an instance, Flora Hottes, who for nearly three years had been serving as Pioneer in La Paz, Bolivia, answered the Inter-America Committee's request to visit Montevideo, Uruguay. Here she replaced Elisabeth Cheney, who had been working with this valiant group of Baha'is in Montevideo, bringing them the loving understanding  and wise counsel they so sorely needed, but who was now due to continue to her original destination, Asuncion, 

Paraguay.                 

 It was particularly to the Republics of Central America and the Islands of the 'West Indies, including Puerto Rico, which, with the Canal Zone, had recently been added to the Inter-America Field of Teaching, that the Inter-America Committee, in the Fall of 1945, endeavored to send the much-needed teaching assistance. Early in June, Elena Marsella, a member of the Boston 

Community,  left Miami   

 for the Dominican Republic to assist Of elia Montalvo, later releasing  Miss 

Montalvo for Pioneer      
service in San Salvador.  

Also in June," Gwenne     

 Sholtis departed from New Orleans to serve as the new Pioneer for Bolivia, breaking her journey in Nicaragua, where Dr. King was carrying forward his valuable work, and stopping over for brief visits in Panama, Guayaquil, Ecuador, and Lima, Peru, on her way to La Paz. In August, Jean Silver returned to her post in Havana, Cuba, and was soon fol —  lowed by Josephine Kruka, who had been 6June 9th, 1945. 

 spending the summer in the United States. Later in the spring of 1946, the Community in Havana was greatly strengthened, and the growth of the Faith in Cuba definitely accel-crated  by the visits of Mr. and Mrs. Sala, Mr. Charles Mason Remey, Mr. and Mrs. Baker, and other friends from the 

United States.            

 In Mexico, which held the high distinction of being the first Baha'i Community established in Latin America, the Spiritual Assembly  was bravely facing internal and external  problems, which seem destined to be presented to young, new Assemblies, later proving to be but steppingstones to greater growth and fuller powers of resourcefulness. To give the assistance and wise consultation needed here, Dorothy Baker left for Mexico City in September, 1945, remaining there for several weeks, counselling the friends, encouraging and helping them to meet, with complete faith and assurance, the difficulties and tests which they were facing. In these efforts, Mrs. Baker had been invaluably assisted  by Mrs. Gayle Woolson, who had accompanied her to Mexico City, stopping there for awhile, before proceeding on the journey she had been requested by the 

Inter-America  Committee  
to make, down through the 

Central American Republics.

 Later, just prior to her return to the United States, Mrs. Baker was joined by Mr. Octavia 

Illes-cas,  a native Peruvian
and now a member of the   

Los Angeles Baha'i Community.

 Mr. Illescas remained several weeks with the Believers  in Mexico City, further encouraging and strengthening them with his loving sympathy, wisdom, and clear understanding of the Baha'i Faith. 

 In the meantime, Mrs. Gayle Woolson had continued her travels southward, making brief visits in 

Guatemala and Honduras    

 before  carrying on several weeks of intensive teaching in Managua, Nicaragua, in the group which had been formed there by Dr. Malcolm King. In late October, she was joined here by Elisabeth Cheney, and as a result of the concentrated efforts of these two experienced Pioneers, this group of eight Believers  was increased to sixteen, and the establishment of a Spiritual Assembly in the last remaining 

Latin American Republic   

 was assured for the April election. From Nicaragua, Mrs. Woolson proceeded to San Jose,


<p703>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS              703

  Costa Rica, where she had previously assisted in the formation of the historic first Spiritual Assembly in that country. 

 During her two-years' absence in the United States, this young community had sorely missed the wise and loving assistance of Mrs. Woolson, and its members were again in great need of guidance and teaching help. In 

December, Evelyn Larson    

 of Chicago was dispatched to San Jose, to remain here indefinitely as 

Pioneer  to Costa Rica.   

 The San Jose Community were further blessed by a short visit from Elisabeth Cheney, en route to Panama; and later, in February, 1946, by the second stay there of Gayle Woolson. 

 On the Eastern coast of the 'Western Hemisphere, the Baha'i activities had been greatly stimulated during the Fall of 1945 and early months of 1946. 

 Dr. Malcolm King, who had been in the United States since his return there from Nicaragua in August, left Miami in early December, to serve as Pioneer to Haiti. 

 Welcome visits from Mr. and Mrs. Rafi Mottahedeh, and later from Mr. Raphael Pompelly and daughter, early in 1945, had brought new inspiration to the friends in Port-au-Prince, but the death (on November fourth) of Gerald McBean, long the mainstay of the Community, had been a great loss to the Believers in Haiti. 

 Farther south, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the progress of the Faith was markedly accelerated by a series of events which were to give a new impetus to the growth of the Cause in this, the largest of the Latin American  Republics, and to bring to fruition the devoted and selfless labors of former Pioneers here. 

 Leonora Holsapple Armstrong, who had served the Faith in Brazil so assiduously and for so many years, had moved to Rio de Janeiro, from Recife, early in 1945. Here, she and Mrs. Carol Wood had been promoting the Baha'i raith until Mrs. Wood's departure, in the spring, for a visit to the United States. On 

November 9th, Virginia     

 Orbison, returning  to the Latin America field of teaching, after spending the summer in the United States, arrived in this beautiful capital city, and was almost immediately followed by the Itinerant Teachers, — first, Charles Mason Remey, and a short time later, Mr. and Mrs. Erneric Sala. 

 Through the conferences, interviews, terviews, and public meetings which ensued, new avenues of publicity were opened up, fresh contacts developed, and a far-reaching and encouraging interest in the Faith shown throughout Rio de Janeiro. In the meantime, Gertrude Eisenberg, former Pioneer in Paraguay, had been transferred from Asuncion to Sao Paulo, and had been amazed at the ready interest in the Baha'i Teachings manifested in this important city of Brazil. The momentum of the teaching work in Brazil was further accelerated by the arrival in January,  1946, of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Bode, who had given up their home in California to settle indefinitely in Rio and to promote the Baha Faith there. In March, these valiant  Pioneers were joined by Shirley Warde, a member of the San Francisco Community, en route to her new post in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

 Striving to utilize to their fullest the many wonderful channels that were suddenly and miraculously opened up to them, this inspired group, early teachers and new Pioneers alike, directed their collective efforts towards the formation of the first Spiritual Assembly in Rio de Janeiro. In the achievement of this goal, 

North American  Pioneers  

 had once again been effectively assisted by the dedicated services of a Latin American Baha'i. 

 Dr. Tomas Sanchez Egea, a former member of the group in Montevideo, had been transferred in business from Uruguay  to Rio and had contributed unstintingly both of his time and efforts to the promotion of the Baha'i Faith in Brazil. The following cable message received by the Inter-America Committee on April 21st, brought the certain news that their tireless and zealous labors had not been in vain: ttTwelve Rio de Janeiro members send loving greetings." 

(Signed) "First Spiritual  
Assembly."                
   Although a Spiritual Assembly

 had been formed in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in the election of 1945, the Baha'i Faith in Quito, the capital city of this Republic, had not progressed  since John Stearns, the first Pioneer here, left the country for Lima, Peru. 

 With the hope of developing the group of four Believers still remaining, into a Baha'i Community,  Hascie Cornbleth, who had experienced his first pioneering in a brief stay in Mexico City during April, 1945, left Los

  Angeles in the spring of 1946 to settle and teach in Quito. 

 Simultaneously with this consistent and intensive endeavor towards the foundation of the goal Assemblies, special efforts had been concentrated, during the fall and winter of 19444 5, on another of the immediate objectives stressed by the Guardian, — namely, on "a wider dissemination of Baha'i Literature in both Spanish and Portuguese." 

 Also in consultation with the Latin American dekgates to the Centenary and July Conference  in 1944, the National Spiritual Assembly  had appointed a committee7 centering in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with the express function of translating Baha'i books into Spanish, of reviewing translations supplied  from other centers, and of recommending  the order in which books were to be sent to the press, referring their recommenda-dons,  however, for final approval, to the National Spiritual Assembly. A similar committee8, centering in Rio, was appointed at the same time, charged with the responsibility  of trans'ating and publishing Baha'i 

Literature  in Portuguese.

 Also in consultation with the representatives  from 

Latin America, the National Spiritual

 Assembly had appointed the proper Committees9 in Panama, and had assigned to them the responsibility of carrying on the two activities of distributing Baha'i Literature  through a center, secondary to that set up in Buenos Aires; and of producing a monthly "Bulletin" in Spanish, to carry pertinent Baha'i t!News Items," ctTeaching Plans," notices of new Publications and other Baha'i material for Latin America. 

 The initiation of these vitally important projects presented a gigantic task for those immediately responsible for them, and in Buenos Aires particularly, the prosecution of the work demanded a heroic measure of ceaseless and selfless devotion, and the sac~

 rifice of leisure time and rest. After the customary long hours of business, the members  of the Reviewing, 

Publishing and Distributing 

 Committee devoted evening after evening to the arduous labor of translating and reviewing and finally to the publishing and distribution of its first editions. 

 Realizing the immensity of this task, the Inter-America Committee had especially commissioned Elisabeth Cheney, who arrived in Buenos Aires in January, 1945, to concentrate  on assisting the heavily-laden Committee members with the many details connected  with the printing of translations already approved. With this timely and efficient assistance, they soon had ready for distribution, in addition to the already published  "New Era," supplies of ttDispensa~ don," "Baha'i Prayers" and a free literature pamphlet, "El Alba de una Nueva Era." Carrying out the enlarged plan for the dissemination of their publications, shipments were made to the newly-appointed Committee in Panama, to be sent in turn by this body to the particular area assigned to them. To give special impetus to a wider dissemination of the new publications, "Gift Allotments"  including a small suppiy of each, were sent to every Latin American Center, to be sold by them, and the proceeds used to start local revolving funds for future purchases of these books. Thus each Community  began its participation in the larger and all-important function of stimulating the growth of the Baha'i 

Faith throughout Latin     

 America by a constantly increasing dissemination of its literature. 

 The first issue of the Spanish Bulletin, assigned specifically to the Committee in Panama, appeared in March, 1945, and gave promise of being yet another effective medium  of stimulating the growing cooperation and collective efforts of the different Latin American Baha'i Communities. Circular Letters, sent out at frequent intervals by the Inter-America Committee, bearing on such important matters as "Guardianship," tTeasts)~ ttFasting,~~ tcTeachng Methods," tCBah&~i Procedure," cCVotingf~ teDuties and Responsibilities of a Spiritual Assembly," contributed further to the Guardian's stated ~     of "creating closer relationship

  between, and consolidating" these newly-fledged  Communities. 

 This growing sense of fellowship and unity between the Believers of the different republics was definitely accelerated and developed  through the frequent visits from Pioneers en route to new posts, bringing with them stimulating news of the Cause elsewhere, and of the friends in other lands. To even a greater degree, Itinerant Teachers, in their longer stays, deepened and strengthened these bonds of understanding and unity, developing in the smaller, more isolated, groups a sense of being an integral and essential part of a Faith, worldwide in scope. The 

Inter-America Committee    

 was greatly aided and assisted both in this aspect of its work and in its endeavors to bring the Cause more effectively to the attention of the "masses," by the extensive travels through Latin America of Mr. and Mrs. Emeric Sala, of Montreal, Canada; and of Charles Mason Remey, a member of the Washington, D. C., Baha'i 

Community.                 
   On October 20th, 1945,     

Emeric and Rosemary  Sala 

 set out on their journey, which was to take them by plane, first to Mexico City, then through Central America to Panama;  thence via Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, to Buenos Aires; and then up the East Coast through Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba, back to Miami and home. In the nineteen 

Latin-American Republics   

 included in their cpmprehensive itinerary, Mr. Sala gave seventy-nine Baha'i talks, ten over the radio, to audiences ranging from fifteen to two hundred and twenty. All possible channels  of publicity were utilized to their fullest,  resulting in at least forty-seven free newspaper articles, covering from one to five columns, seventeen of which were accompanied by pictures of the speaker. 

 Two leading  newspapers in Panama and San Salvador, for instance, featured the Baha'i Faith and its principles of World Federation on their front pages. Of equal importance to the publicity and prestige they were able to gain for the Faith, throughout their journey, were the inspiration and courage these Baha from older and more established Communities brought to the new Believers in Latin America,  and the loving understanding and fel lowsbip they expressed in their conferences about local problems. That the joy and inspiration  gained from these associations were shared mutually, is attested to by the following excerpts from letters received by the Inter-America Committee from Mr. and 

Mrs.                       
Sala:                      

 "Our journey is over and belongs to the world of our reminiscences. We have a wider vision and greater zest for service because of the bounty of this contact with our dear Latin American friends." 

 Like a symphonic  motif, sometimes in a higher or lower key, sometimes clear, then faint, in each Baki'i Community we recalled these words of Baha'u'llah, tAnd the love of God like. unto an artery, shall beat through the heart of five continents.' According to our capacity,  we brought the love of North America through South America. To feel that love coursing through two continents was as much as I could bear! We saw in the six years since our last visit that a whole continent  has come alive and is now breathing to the rhythm of those words of Baha'u'llah. Baha of the North have been honored beyond kings to be the instruments for such a deed." 

 Speaking of one of the newly-pledged communities, 

Mrs. Sala wrote: "As I     

 look back on the happy days spent here, I think that this wonderful Community must have been a dream out of the Dawn-Breakers! Their dedicated spirit, their devotion of mind and heart and love for one another, melts my heart to think of them. It was only three days, but it was a timeless experience, a foretaste of this earth when it becomes conscious of being a world of God." 

 On November 13th, 1945, Charles Mason Remey left Miami on the extended journey which he had graciously consented to undertake in the interest of the Inter-America teaching work and for the sole purpose of visiting every Baha group or Community in South America, even in such remote centers  as Asuncion, Paraguay, and Punta Arenas,  Chile, twelve hundred miles south by auto, beyond the limits of the Argentinian railroad. First, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, then both Baha and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil were visited by Mr. Remey, as he winged his way Southward by Pan 

Amer

  ican World Airways; then Uruguay and Paraguay followed, en route to Buenos Aires, before his long dip down to Magallanes. Turning Northward from Punta Arenas, this indefatigable traveler next visited the Baha of Valparaiso and Santiago de Chile, and thence pursued his way up the West Coast of South America to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama, finally crossing the Caribbean to Jamaica and Cuba on his way back to the United States. 

 In public addresses to interested audiences of varying sizes, Mr. Remey, as the Salas had done, brought the Teachings of Baha'u'llah to the CCmasses~~ and through the wonderful publicity accorded to him, — press, as well as radio, — he proclaimed their regenerative~ and hopeful message, far beyond the confines of his "visible" audiences, adding both to the prestige and wider knowledge of the Cause throughout South America. In other and more informal gatherings everywhere, Mr. Remey shared with the young new Baha'is his rich experiences, garnered from long years of association with, and service to, the Baha'i Faith, covering the early difficult days of its establishment in North America, and including Mr. Remey's visits with 'Abdu'l-Baha and the Guardian, in 'Akka and Haifa, Palestine, and his world travels in the interests of the Cause. With loving and sympathetic understanding of their problems and tasks, he brcmght them fresh courage and inspiration by demonstrating so convincingly the vitality and power of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, which despite supreme tests and trials had grown and developed so miraculously from small beginnings, all over the world. That he, too, had gained immeasurably from his contacts with the Latin American friends is clearly evidenced in the following excerpt from a letter written by him from Chile to the Inter-America 

Committee:                 

 ~tIt is really a heart-stirring experience to be here in this distant-from-the-world outpost  of the Cause." 

 "The deeper I get into this Baha'i work in Latin America, the more profound is my respect and admiration of the service of the Pioneer teachers. Until coming to South America, I did not know that we in North America were producing such Baha'i material as I find in these outposts  of the 

Cause."                    

 For free distribution, in connection with the Public Meetings arranged everywhere for these Itinerant Teachers, special pamphlets were published on the history, principles and tenets of the Baha'i Faith, as well as on such pertinent and timely subjects as peace and world order. The Spiritual 

Assembly of Mexico  City  

 contributed to the common effort by translating and printing in Spanish Shoghi Effendi's pamphlet, tcPattern for a Future Society," which they generously shared with several of the nearby republics. The Panama City Community quickly brought out a condensation in Spanish of the ttBahA'i Peace Program," (printed originally for the San Francisco Conference) 10 and distributed this to the other Baha'i Centers in its Area. Though small in numbers, the group in Rio de Janeiro translated and printed in Portuguese a similar condensation of this "Peace Program," and later compiled and published an excellent booklet of general information on the Bab&'i Teachings. 

 In La Paz, Bolivia, the Pioneer, Gwcnne Sholtis, working in collaboration with Arturo de Cuellar, one of the devoted and ardent members of this newiy fledged Community, produced a very effective pamphlet on the principles and general  history of the Faith, while the Reviewing and Publishing Committee in Buenos Aires printed large editions of the 'tBah&i 

Peace Plan" and "El Alba   

 de urn Nueva Era" for these particular distributions. 

 Thus, because of the exceptional publicity, both radio and press, and the wide distribution of Baha'i literature which resulted from their Public Meetings and through their intimate  conferences with the Baha'is themselves, these traveling teachers, even in their brief visits to the various countries, at once brought a fresh impetus to the growth of the Faith throughout Latin America and aided very materially in the process of drawing together and consolidating these recently-formed but most promising Baha'i 

Communities.              
 Like an echo of the historic

1944 Baha'i Centennial     

 Celebration, similarly significant in the creative force it released and in the widespread repercussions it caused, the First Latin 

American Baha'i Teaching  

 Conference, April 25th to June 26th, 1945.

  held in Panama City from January 20th to 2 5th, 1946, will ever stand out as one of those portentous and definite milestones in the unfoldment of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan. It marked a new stage in the expansion of the Cause and in the growing strength and harmony of its already established units. 

 The idea of this Conference was conceived in the summer of 1945 and enthusiastically stimulated, especially by Mrs. Loulie Mathews,  whose contribution to. the Inter-Amer-ica teaching work, since its very beginning, has been unique. Although it was sponsored by the 

International School      

 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and by the Inter-America Committee, the working out of all its details and the carrying out of its final plans were achieved with unusual efficiency by a special Committee, appointed by, and in consultation  with, the local Spiritual Assembly of Panama City. To their devoted and wholehearted consecration to their task and to the invaluable assistance so generously accorded  them by visiting Baha'is, the ultimate gratifying success of this epochmaking occasion was in a very large measure due. 

     The National Spiritual    
Assembly and Inter-America

 Committee were represented officially at the Panama Conference by Mrs. Amelia Collins, a member of both of these bodies. 

 At one of the sessions of the Conference,  Mrs. Collins spoke especially on Baha'i Administration, stressing its vital importance and clarifying many of its functions and institutions. 

 Native Believers from ten of the Latin American Centers, and eight of the 

North American Pioneers   

 gathered in Panama City, and in a marvelous spirit of brotherhood and unity each contributed his or her part to the well-rounded program of this Conference. 

 Mornings were devoted to informal sessions during which an intensive study was conducted of the Guardian's latest book, rrGod Passes By," of administration and of teaching methods. 

 In the evenings public lectures were arranged with talks on some of the basic Teachings of the Faith, such as "Unity of Religion," "Progressive 

Revelation," "One-ness    

 of Mankind," and ttDivine Art of Living."  The largest and most impressive public session was held Friday evening, January 2 5th, in the main auditorium of the 

Inter-American            

 American University which had been graciously  placed at the disposal of the 

Conference  Committee.   

 Participating with two Baha Speakers, Dr. Octayjo 

Mendez Pereira, Rector    

 of the University and Delegate from Panama to the San Francisco Conference for the establishment of U. N. 0., gave one of the principal addresses. 

 Under the allover theme of "Peace," Dr. Mendez Pereira spoke on "The Problem of Peace in the Light of the San Francisco Conference" and brought out the need for a pact both more universal and more spiritual than that embodied in the U. N. 0. Charter. 

 Miss Elisabeth Cheney followed, delineating for her audience 'the "Lesser Peace," spoken of by Baha'u'llah, which is in the process of evolving, and which will ultimately be based on a new concept of citizenship, requiring "for the man of tomorrow and the child of today" education from a new standpoint, new teaching  that will enable him to live in peace and harmony with his fellow-beings. 

 ttT and lasting Peace," Miss Cheney affirmed, "can only be achieved in this way of educating the world according to the universal, di-vinely-just principles of Baha'u'llah." 

 As a glorious climax and fitting close to this important public meeting and to the Conference  itself, Mrs. Gayle W'oolson, in her address  on "The Most Great Peace," unfolded the vision of that time when the "Lesser Peace," achieved mostly through the statesmen and rulers of the world, will be followed by the Golden Age of Baha'u'llah, when universal,  supreme peace will be firmly established  for all mankind and will be maintained through the functioning of a World State in which nations, races, creeds and classes will be closely and permanently united. Mrs. Woolson pointed out that this presupposes the spiritual regeneration of all humanity, because oniy the higher power of the Spirit can bring about such a state of unity and understanding. 

 "The express, the primal Mission of Baha'u'llah," she emphasized, "is to unify all human beings in true oneness and to inaugurate a new and sublime era of spirituality, peace, brotherhood, and justice." 

 Once again, as during the Baha'i Centennial of 1944, representatives from all the Americas bad participated with full equality and freedom in consultation on important

708             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Baha'i matters, in the deeper study of the tenets of the Faith, and in discussions of the most effective ways of promoting its growth and establishing its Administrative Order. Impressed anew with the vitality and greatness  of the Cause, they were revitalized and recharged for the part they are to play in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan, aware, as never before, of their collective responsibilities. 

 Though members of small and newly-formed  Baha Communities, they drew strength and inspiration through this loving association and true fellowship with other Believers, and knew themselves to be integral parts of the ever-expanding 

Baha'i World Community.    

 Once more, in a measure mx-approached  since the Centenary, was the bond of unity between the followers of Baha'u'llah throughout the Hemisphere reinforced  and a new impulse given to the Cause as a whole, creating in all those present fresh determination to ioin their forces to coordinate their activities and efforts, and with radiant spirits to rededicate themselves to the advancement of the Baha'i Faith, in all of its aspects, throughout their native lands. With hearts gladdened and their resolve  strengthened by a new sense of oneness, fortified with a deeper understanding of their Faith, and with a clearer vision of its mi-portance  and high destiny, the participants in the 

Panama Teaching Conference 

 scattered,  and returning to their homelands, communicated to their respective communities the fresh and dynamic spiritual force which had been generated at 

Panama.                    

 To a degree far exceeding the hopes and expectations of those instrumental in its planning, this unprecedented event aided, and contributed to, the growth of the Faith in Latin America, giving a fresh impulse to the coinciding processes of the consolidation and of the expansion of the Cause. In the months immediately following it became increasingly evident that a firmer bond of understanding and fellowship had welded together the component parts of the Western Hemisphere, into a unified whole. 

 In 1944, as the first Baha'i Century drew to its close, Spiritual Assemblies in sixteen of the Latin American Republics, including Puerto Rico (which was not then under the Inter-America work) has been established. Now, two years later, in the elections1' just reported, twenty-six Spiritual Assemblies are listed, one for each of the Latin American Republics, two in Brazil, Colombia, and Costa Rica; and three in faraway Chile. The Baha'i Cause, throughout the Western World has passed into a new stage, the scope of its activities has been definitely enlarged and the basis of its Administrative Structure both consolidated and expended. During these two eventful years, not oniy has the momentum of the Cause been markedly accelerated,  but the development of the Faith in these awakening Republics has taken a more specific direction, promising new and even greater achievements through the unified and collective efforts of Baha'i Communities stretching in an unbroken chain throughout Latin America. 

 In a world suffering from postwar weariness  and demoralization, and which, as far as faith and order are concerned, is but a vacuum, the Faith of Baha'u'llah sweeps on in its irresistible and destined course. To a humanity, spiritually as well as physically exhausted, it is demonstrating with ever-in-creasing  vigor and strength its power to supplant destruction with construction, disintegration with integration, and to build a new world order in which lasting and universal  peace is assured. 

 Now clearly foreshadowed to the discerning, is the attainment of those "mighty victories" which the Guardian, in his cable of July 17th, 1944, had stressed as "the essential preliminaries to the emergence of the independent National Spiritual Assemblies and as the indispensable prelude to the launching, in other continents •    of the second stage of the momentous world plan, so intimately associated by 'Abdu'l-Baha, with the future destinies of the illustrious American 

Baha'i Community."

             GETTING READY FOR THE PEACE

  B~ DR. H. A. OVERSTREET Address delivered on the program of the Baha'i Centenary, Wihnette, Illinois, May 192 5, 1944. 

  IT IS fitting in this house of worship that we should talk of peace, for peace is its foundation. It is fitting that we should talk of universal peace, for universality is the heart and soul of its design. 

 We are still a world at war. 'When peace comes, will we be ready, all over the world, to say: "There shall be no more war. 

 I speak here tonight as an American; but I hope I speak, too, as a citizen of the world. 

 I hope I speak in the spirit of your own beloved Master when he said: "Th earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens. 

 In a number of months — a year perhaps — (we hope it will not be longer)  — the war will be over. We shall be delirious with joy because no guns will any longer be murdering human beings; because the weak will not need to hide; the strong will no longer have to offer themselves as a brave sacrifice for freedom. 

 The war will be over and peace will be begun. Will it be a beautiful, exciting peace? Will it be a peace of up. building? A singing, creative peace — all mankind putting their minds and wills together  to make a world fit for the spirit of man? 

 We hope it will be. But with our hope is mingled a great fear. We may miss the adventure  ahead of us. We may be so tired, so sick of all the cruelty and destruction, of all the uncertainty and disruption of life that we shall want to relax, to get back to the beloved routines of family life and of chosen work. We shall want to join our friends and let the world "go hang." 

 That was the way it was last time. It may be that way again. If it is, we shall miss another of the great chances — perhaps the greatest chance — given us by the ages. 

 To be forewarned, however, is to be forearmed.  We of the older generation in America  are not happy at the way we behaved last time. Perhaps the best we can now do will be to keep on reminding ourselves And reminding  the younger generation how we fell away from the task. It may warn us not to do it again. 

 Also, we of the older generation are not happy at the way we allowed the great cause of world union to become the football of the pettiest and meanest politics. 

 This time we must put petty and mean politics aside. The deepest hopes of mankind will be at stake; and we must not again sell those hopes for a miserable mess of political pottage. Also, we are not happy as we remember the shifting indecisiveness of the last peace —  how we shuttled back and forth between a severity that was too severe and a generosity that was too generous. 

 Nor are we happy at the mistakes we made about our enemy, the Germans, thrusting upon them a democracy for which they were quite unprepared,  and remaining utterly oblivious to their determined will for another war. 

 I think the chief function of us older ones will be to insist that this time we get our minds prepared for the job. Peace will not come as a happy surprise, like a bird's song in springtime. 

 It will have to be worked for, sweated for, perhaps fought for. Not everyone will want the same kind of peace. Some will want the kind that will be merely an irritant for another war. Some will want the kind that will fail to rectify the iniquities that have made wars in the past and will make them in the future. Some will want a peace that is kind to the enemy; some will want a harsh and inhuman peace. 

 Some will merely want what is good for their special kind of business. Some will want a peace that will make us the most powerful nation in the world. A peace that is to be wise and lust must spring from minds that have learned to be wise and just.


<p710>
710             THE BAHA'! WORLD

  Dr. Harry Allen Overstreet, guest speaker oi the program rCThe Centenary of the Baha'i Faith," May 22, 1944. The title of his address was ttGetting Ready for 'World Peace." 

  We shall have to be sunclear about a number  of things. 

 In the first place, we must be convinced, this time, beyond the glimmer of a doubt, that hereafter nations can no longer go it alone. We ought now to know that a world of completely independent nations is a world of potential lawlessness. 

 It is a world in which any strong, ill-motivated nation can descend with violence upon its neighbor nations.  It is a world in which oniy force can be protection; a world, therefore, in which small, peace-loving nations can have no se curity of existence. It is a world in which the strong nations must be forever preoccupied  with making themselves stronger. 

 There is no need to repeat the arguments. If, after all the arguments we have beard and all the tragic experience we have had in two world wars, we are still not convinced of the need for a world united against aggression,  then God help the world. It will go to its destruction, because of the incurable stupidity of its people. 

 But to organize a world united against aggression will not be enough. If the United


<p711>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS               711

  Nations, with their world police, perpetuate the same old racial exploitations and economic  imperialisms that have been the sources of wars in the past, then they will perpetuate wars an-long us. We must be prepared, therefore, to work not only for internationalism but for that type of internationalism  which is economically and socially democratic. This means that we must keep an alert eye on all the new efforts to monopolize or cartelize economic resources, as well as all efforts to perpetuate forms of imperialistic domination. 

 It is necessary for us to realize, therefore, that we have a delicate and difficult job ahead of us. After the war is over, German education, both in the schools and outside the schools, must not be allowed to remain the morally perverting thing the German leaders have made it to be. 
   Who will do the changing?  

 All our democratic  scruples cry out against imposing reforms from the outside. Americans will never want to impose their educational system upon Germany; nor will the English want to impose theirs; nor the Russians. 

 It may be that we shall have to find a solution through some kind of world body of educators  — a body of men and women who, passionate for the peace of the world, will suggest  modifications of the old militaristic and authoritative forms of German education. Such a body, if it is wise, will find those Germans of democratic mind and experience (there will be many of them abroad and some in underground Germany) who will be best able to help Germany create new forms of education compatible with what is best in the German spirit. 

 We shall have to be sunclear about this. Nothing short of a fundamental reorientation of the German mind and character will make the Germans safe for the world. 

 We shall want to be clear about a third point. This is not just a war between ourselves  and Germany, nor between ourselves and all the Axis powers. 

 There is a tendency always to see a war in territorial terms: the enemy over there, we over here. 
This war is different.     

 The enemy is everywhere — all over the world — even among ourselves. 

 They may sit by our side at a public dinner; may Live in the next apartment; may be making speeches in Congress. 

 Every occupied country now realizes that the enemy were in their midst long before the Nazis came: Quislings in Norway; 

Lavals in France; Dutch    
Nazis in Holland; Belgian  

 Nazis in Belgium. Spain has its Falangists; Argentine its native Fascists. 
We in America have our     

American Fascists.         

 The lines of this war extend all over the world. 

 The fight is between two kinds of people. This is the fundamental thing to remember. The fight is between people, on the one band, who want power for themselves,  special rights for themselves; people who believe that in race, or financial strength, or cleverness, they are worthier than the rest, and that their special worthiness  gives them the right to take what they please; to be ruthless if need be; to be downright cruel if cruelty will get them what they want — it is a fight between such ruthless,  power-seeking people and people who want all human beings to have equal rights to life and freedom and the pursuit of their happiness. 

 The fight is between a democratic order of life and a fascistic order of life. Fascism, in all its forms, is the arrogant assertion of special privilege. 

 Democracy is the denial of special privilege. 

 It is the affirmation that all men are born equal in their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of their happiness. Fascism sets man against man; divides rather than unites. 

 Fascism, therefore, is and always  has been the breeder of war. Democracy encourages man to cooperate with fellow  man; it unites rather than divides. Democracy, therefore is and always will be the prerequisite of peace. 

 Long ago one of the great masters of life formulated for us the law of civilized behavior:  "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." in other words, give every human being the same chances for life that you would yourself like to have. 

 On the other hand, all through the centuries, the misunderstanders and misusers of life have formulated the counter rule: Do unto others whatever kind of doing will get you what you want. cdt is the eternal struggle," said Lincoln, "between two principles. The one is the common right of humanity and the other divine right of kings. It is the same


<p712>
712             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  spirit that says, tYou toil and earn bread and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes it is the same tyrannical principle." 

 Ours, therefore, is the world old fight for human decency. We have to be clear about this, We are fighting to get rid of all forms of oppression, wherever or whatever they may be. We, in America, are fighting for what we call our American dream. 

 Two forms of inequality today begin to appear to us as particularly odious: one, the inequality of rights as between Negro and White in America; two, the inequality of respect as between Occidental and Oriental. All fair-minded Americans know that our treatment of the Negroes is inconsistent with our democratic pretensions. 

 Unfortunately, there are many Americans who, in this matter,  are not yet fairminded. 

 Second, there is the inequality of respect as between 

Occident and Orient.       

 We, of the occidental world, and particularly we of America, have never yet been fully enough aware of our occidental provincialism: we have simply taken it for granted that we of the West are the preferred brand of human  beings. 

 We assumed that we had the best political forms and the best industrial forms; so what more needed to be said. For generations, we have regarded the Orient as negligible, to be treated with more or less of contempt. 

 This, too, must go. The feeling we have had that we are the Master Hemisphere is not very far removed from the idea of the Master 

Race.                      

 If there is to be world peace, there must be world respect. We shall have to think of all cultures — eastern or western — as having  equal right to grow in their essential ways. For the arrogance and intolerance of our traditional Cultural Monism, we must substitute the generosity and respect of Cultural  Pluralism. 

 I shall not speak except in passing about the ugly blot of antiSemitism. 

 With shame be it said, there are Americans who willingly and deliberately spread that ugLiness among us, It shows how unfinished as yet is the job of democracy. 

 It shows how necessary is the strengthening of a spiritual sense of what democracy is about. 

 It is probably true that many Americans have never dreamed the American dream. They have simply accepted this land as the place of their opportunity, But the American  dream is more than that. It is a dream that includes others — includes them not as persons to be tricked and persecuted, but as persons to whom we say: ttCome along; we've got a land to build a land of freedom a land where things will be better for our children than they were for us. We don't care whether you're rich or poor, Methodist or Presbyterian, Jew or Gentile,  whether you speak with an accent or in Boston English, come along." Something like that is the American dream — and antiSemitism just doesn't fit into it, So out it must go — from our own land as well as from the rest of the world. 

 This, then, is the third point we must be clear about. We must know Fascism in all its forms; and deliberately, courageously, following in the spirit of all the liberals of the past, we must eradicate it from our midst. 

 In one of his last letters, Benjamin Franklin  wrote: "God grant that not oniy the iove of liberty but a thorough knowledge of the rights of man may pervade all the nations of the earth, so that a philosopher may set his foot anywhere on its surface and say, tThis is my country' But there is a warning we must give ourselves: Rome was not built in a day: world cooperation and world peace will not be achieved at a stroke. 

 Those of us who have chosen our favorite blueprint of a world union, may have to learn a certain patience. Already the opposing  forces are drawn up in battle array. There are those who are all out for a world organization; and there are those who, at the drop of a hat, are ready to fight all plans that imperil the sovereignty of their nation or the magisterial omnicompetence of their empire. 

 Before so vast an undertaking as union of the world can be achieved, men must be given time to grow accustomed to so novel an idea. This we failed to do after the last war, 

The League of Nations      

 was thrust upon a people whose habits of mind were nationalistic. The shock was too great.

  It may be that world association will have to come quietly, step by step, without any too great invasion of our traditional nationalistic loyalties. As a matter of fact, it is already coming that way. The 

United Nations  Relief   

 and Rehabilitation Administration is the first modest organ of world government generated by this war. Even it was opposed; but not successfully, because the reason for its existence was too obvious to be denied. 

 There is a job that will have to be done and it can be done oniy by the combined strength and wisdom of the United Nations. People will have to be fed; cities rebuilt. A united humanity must bring re-lid to the victims of this most terrible of all wars. 

 Here, then, is the first of our world undertakings. 
There will be many more.  

 The monetary systems of the devastated coun —  tries must be restored and reorganized. This will call for a United Nations 

Monetary Administration.  

 Manufacturing must be resumed;  business rebuilt; access to raw materials established. This will call for a United 

Nations Economic Administration.

 Schools must be rebuilt; education restored; the profound problem of what to do about German  (and later, Japanese) education must be solved. For that we shall require a United Nations 

Educational Commission.   

 As one problem after another is tackled; as one united nations commission after another is organized and settles to its work, we shall begin to get used to the idea that we live in a world where worldwide problems must be handled on a worldwide basis. Without our knowing it, we shall slip into the habit of thinking in world terms. And before we know it, we will have passed out of the tradition of nationalistic thinking and be functioning  in terms of world interdependence. 

 Finally, we will need to strengthen ourselves with a basic confidence. 

 We in America  have not suffered much from the impact of war. Our cities have nor been bombed. We have witnessed here nothing of the war's horror and devastation. It sometimes seems as if we hardly know that a war is on. Those who have lost loved ones perhaps feel dif

  ferently. But the bulk of Americans seem hardly aware of the profound crisis through which our nation and our world are passing. Hence to many of us there would appear to be small hope that Americans will be passionate  about making the kind of peace that needs to be made. 

 We need to take heart out of what is happening in the war countries. 
Those people are not apathetic.

 Among them there is such a surge of democratic passion as the world has never yet experienced. In underground France they wait for the day when free France will assert her right to a new democratic  way of life. In Jugoslavia, they fight and they wait. 
In Poland they wait.       
In Belgium. In Holland.    
In Denmark. In Norway.    

In Czechoslovakia. In      

 Greece. In China. Democracy was never as passionate a desire among people in all the world before. These people are not apathetic. 

 These people wiii surge forth when the last gun is fired, and woe betide any government, in eidle or at home, that tries to deny them their democratic freedom. 

 We must build ourselves a new image of war's end. 

 The old image is that of a swarming  of political stuffed shirts around a peace table; of endless, futile, pontifical talk; of papers drawn up and papers torn up; of agreements reached that are no agreements; of a peace that will make no peace. This is the image that the last war's end left on our minds. 

 Perhaps we can begin to build a new image; the image of a new chance for all of us literally for all of us. We haven't done half of what we might do with our world. We have left it poor and divided and fear-ridden when we might have made it rich and united and courageously generous. We have had all the materials; all the technical  brains. 

 What we have lacked has been a motive, an impulse, a will, a sense of great values. 

 What we needed was to want a more decent world so desperately that we would plunge passionately into creating it. Perhaps we shall never have that will; but if, by any chance we were to have it, we would become the most excited people in the world. There would be something ahead of us something tremendous to do a world to create. 

 When the war ends, we shall have a chance never before given in all the history of the world. 

 This war has done more to reveal the basic cleavages of life than any war ever fought. It has done more to shake men, everywhere, out of complacency, out of a sense that God's in His Heaven and all's right with the world. Never in all history has the soui of man been so deeply stirred. Never has the world been so ripe to take up the challenge of a new world to create. 

 A few months now — God grant that they may be few — and the great excitement of peace will be upon us; the excitement of an end that is to be a beginning; the excitement of going back to where we were, but also of moving forward to where we want to be.

"Wir wiinschen nur das Wohi der Welt und das GlUck der Vblker," sagt Baha'u'llah, ttdennoch hilt man uns fur Anstifter von Streit unci Aufruhr, die Gefangenschaft und Verbannung verdienen. 

 Wir wfinschen, dass alle Vblker in einem Glauben vereint und alle Menschen Brilder werden, dass das Band der Liebe und Einigkeit zwischen den Mensch —  enkindern gestiirkt werde, dass Religionsver-schiedenheit aufh6re und die zwischen den Rassen gemacliten Unterschiede verschwin den.  Was ist Schlimmes daran? Und doch wird es dahin kommen, werden diese frucht-losen  K~impfe, diese zerst6rcnden Kriege aufh6ren und der 'Grbsste Friede' erscheinen. Habt ihr dies niclit in Europa audi n6tig und ist es niclit das, was Christus verheissen?" Gelegentlich einer deutschen Buchverbffent-lichung im Jalire 1932, die auf den Prinzipien Baha'u'llah's aufbaute, schrieb der ~tV61k ische Beobacliter," dass kein Nationalsozialist an diesen Gedanken vorbei gehen kbnnte, aber fiinf Jabre sp~iter war der BahA'i-Glaube durch die nationalsozialistische Staatsautor-it~it  untersagt, und irn Kriege wurde den dcutschen Baha'i als einziger Gruppe neben Sozialisten und Freimaurern die Oflizierslauf-hahn verschlossen.

Ah~te man und fiirchtere man vie1-leicht die Kraft, die hinter der Walirheir Baha'u'llah's stelit?

Da in der politischen Sph~ire ausserhaib Deutschlands die unerbittliche Notwendigkeit des Zusammenschlusses der Nationen zur Rettung und Sicherung cines dauernden Friedens urn neue, festere Form rang, lOste auch in Deutschland Ernflchter-ung und Verzweiflung so manches verhartete Vorurteil und gab so den Weg frei zu gesfinderem inneren Wiederaufbau. 

 Kaum je zuvor waren die Gedanken und der Glaube Baha'u'llah's hier einern soichen Verlangen und soldier Bercitheir begegnet. 

 Es ist die flberbriickende, allumfassende Einheit, nach der die Herzen im Strudel der Auflbsung greif en: Religion der Einheit, der Auss6h-nung  und des aufbauencien Gestaltens, nick blinder Glaube, sondern Gcwissheit, aus dem Ursprung des Seins herauskommend, gespeist von der vereinenden Liebe sch6pferisch ver-bundenen Daseinsinnes und getragen von den Fliigeln wissenschaftlichcn und religi6sen Erkennens, geistige Grundlage ciner neuen, hdheren Ordnung, auf cler die Gesellschaft von Morgen im Begriff stelit, das feste Geb~ude unzerstdrbarer Solidaritiit und sozialer Gerechtigkeit aufzurichten. 

 Denn ist es nicht so, wie es einmal Viscount Herbert  Samuel, der friihere 

Hohe Kommissar von Pahstina

 und grosse Wertschiitzer 'Abdu'l-Baha's ausgedrtickt hat, dass "andere Religionen und Konfessionen erw~igen mus-sen,  wie sie zurn 

Gedanken der Weltgemein-schaft 

 beizutragen verm5gen, der Bah&i-Glaube  aber fast ausschliesslich zu dem cinen Zweck besteht, zur Gemeinschaft und 

Em-heit  der Menschheit    
zu helfen?"                

 Es ist cine ver~inderte Welt, die wir deutschen Baha'i nach jalirelanger erzwun —  gener Abgeschlossenheit mit der wiederge-wonnenen Freiheit erblicken, die wir in un-seren  Vortdgen, in den vielen Zuschriften und von Mcnsch zu Mensch tagt~ig1ich erleben: Sie will niclit mehr erst miihsam iiberzeugt werden, sie ist bereits flberzeugt noch ehe sie den Ruf reclit geh5rt hat. Sie hat Ejie, aus der Not der Verzweiflung heraus und ist bereft, den Weg zu gehen, wenn wir nur helfen. So ist die Zeit der inneren Bew~ihrung nach neun langen Jaliren unversehens zu einer Zeit der ~usseren Bew~ihrung geworden. Wir haben kein Recht mehr auf uns selbst und auf beschauliche Stille. 

 In den Prilfungen der Verfolgung haben wir gelernt, uns von beidem zu l6sen. Jetzt gilt es, in dieser Gel6stheit dem Ganzen zu dienen, zu arbeiten und immer mehr noch zu arbeiten, mit unerhdrtem Bemiihen und seibstioser Hingabe fiber uns selber hinauszu-wachsen, urn all derer Willen, die auf das lebendige Brot des Glaubens Baha'u'llah's warten, fUr die geistige Gestaltung einer Welt, die erlast scm machte. Wenig mehr als em Jahrzehnt nur trennt uns von dem Zeitpunkt, den 'Abdu'l-Baha nach der Ver-heissung  Daniels fur den Anfang jener Erfiillung angibt: "Der Weltfriede wird fest geschlossen, eine Welthulfssprache eingeffihrt werden. Missverst~ndnisse werden versch-winden, der Bah&'i-Glaube allenthalben verkiindet und die Einheit der Menschheit errichtet werden." Em Jahrzehnt ist kurz, wenn audi fast zu lang angesichts der un-s~ig1ichen  Leiden ciner zerrissenen Mensch-heit, und nur ~iusserste Anstrengungen wer-den  verm5gen, die gewaltigen Probleme vor dem "zu spilt" zur Lbsung zu fiihren. "Warum," rief 'Abdu'l-Baha im November 1912 einer Versammiung in Paris zu, C!hb die Menschen so harte

           RECENT STIRRING YEARS IN CHILE

                  B~ MARCIA STEWARD

  THE historic occasion of the one hundredth Anniversary of the Declaration of the BM saw Chile's Spiritual Assembly at Santiago, represented at the Convention by its Delegate and Secretary, 

Esteban Ganales            

 saw myself living in Punta Arenas, the world's most southern city, whither I had gone eight months before at the Guardian's own request. The great second World War was reaching its most critical turning point, and the unseen battle for the soul of Punta Arenas was in its most hectic phase. 

 To realize that from such an insignificant beginning has since developed Chile's present Baha'i administrative status, namely, three Spiritual Assemblies, each with its own independent  administrative center, is to have borne witness to the invincible creative forces of Baha'u'llah as marshalled and directed by the Guardian. 

 I was once profoundly touched by a particularly poignant appeal for pioneers on the part of the Guardian. 

 In it he lamented his personal inability to do what he was pleading of the North American believers. I believe that he has done it in a very real and holy sense. For the establishment of the Institutions of Baha'u'llah in Chile, is, in essence, the labor of iove of the Guardian. Every Chilean believer recognizes this, and I myself most of all for we asked for, and plentifully received, his love, his affectionate, ate, unerring guidance, his praiseful solicitude, the force of his sacred prayers. 

 The historic dialectic at work in the evolution of the New Order in the world today was never more clearly observable in its action than in the development and consolidation of the Cause in Chile. 

 As Shoghi Effendi so forcefully and lucidly pointed out in God Passes By, every challenge leads to a greater victory, and this in turn produces  yet another and greater challenge, to which the force of the Cause rises with even greater power, to transmute into even greater victory. 

 'Within the Cause, this dialectic is orderly, evident, and purposeful. In the outer world, the same dialectic is impotent and conducive to chaos, for it has no common, constant, and creative purpose. It thus is a dialectic of disintegration. 

 The condition of challenge which sent our Delegate to the Centennial Convention; the subsequent victory which contributed to the consolidation of the 

Spiritual Assembly in Santiago;

 the subsequent challenge which sent this delegate, Chile's first native pioneer, to replace me in Punta Arenas; the victory there, namely the historic formation of Chile's second Spiritual Assembly through the heroic and dedicated efforts of Esteban Canales and Artemus Lamb, leading to the intimate cooperation of the two Assemblies

  at the challenge to the Faith in Valparaiso, with that latest and greatest victory, the formation of Chile's third Spiritual Assembly  in that city; these successive and orderly crises, if you will, demonstrate the modus operandi of, and the inherent power within, the mighty Faith of Baha'u'llah. 

 What other historic force operating in the world today can demonstrate such vitality and purposiveness can turn to its purpose every seeming setback, or convert defeat into total victory? The very intensity of the Divine Dialectic Process would shatter its instruments  if it were not Divine. 

 The most salient feature of the past two years in relation to the work in Chile, is perhaps, the development of Extension Teaching, which curiously enough contributed  more than any other factor to the consolidation  of the fledgling Assemblies using it. This type of teaching had been initiated as early as the summer of 1941, as one of the first methods employed to consolidate the original group, formed in April of that year. 

 This baby group sent Tony Fillon, Dr. Roberto Siebenshein, now deceased, and myself,  to Valparaiso at various times, for short teaching visits. 

 It also authorized other members to teach in Collipulli, and in Te-muco,  where there was at one time a group of five former 

Santiago Baha'is. But       

 it was oniy after the election of Chile's first Spir itual Assembly at Santiago that this method of teaching was fully developed. 

 A Teaching Committee was then immediately appointed and all of the subsequent work in Chile has been, at least ostensibly, under the direction of the Mother Assembly, until the newer Assemblies had been formed. 

  Since this Mother Assembly 

 was always notoriously in the process of consolidation itself, it is the more notable that the results of its teaching work have been so outstanding.  One might well ask, why? 

 The answer lies partly in the practice of throwing responsibility upon the Assembly, since it is obvious that oniy through experience  will an Assembly mature and of, as a corollary, likewise giving full credit for success and accomplishment to that collective  body; and, partly in the spiritual temperament  of the believers charged with the task of establishing new Assemblies. 

  The Santiago Assembly      

 has always had the function of a fountain continually to give out that it might receive. It has constantly sent forth its best pioneer material. But it also possessed another sort of material, believers with the "staying power" and the spiritual gumption to serve as an anchor for the little teaching ships that put out; even though the anchor itself was continually at the mercy of heavy seas. In a sense this first Chilean Assembly never had a real chance to consolidate, since it was in a constant state of flux and internal dissension. 

 Nevertheless, to it must redound the undeniable credit of mothering two Assemblies, if we wish to faithfully interpret the facts in the spirit of the Administrative 

Order.                     

 When we look back at those tumultuous, hectic, anguish-laden conditions within the Santiago Community which obtained in those early days, and see how in the process of extension, of expansion, that community consolidated, sloughing off its parasitical growths as its spiritual Lungs expanded it becomes a iesson in a new procedure, a new method, of solving internal difficulties. 

     Although the Beloved Guardian

 sent me to Punta Arenas to establish a Baha'i group there, I went under strictly administrative procedure, i.e., under the titular auspices of the Santiago Assembly. I kept my relationship to the Santiago Assembly paramount in my consciousness, maintaining a spiritual bond with it on the one hand, and on the other teaching the Faith in Magallanes in relation to an already established Chilean Later, when our delegate to the Centennial,  Esteban Canales, replaced me as pioneer  there, it was oniy after due consultation with, and the approval of, the Spiritual Assembly, of which he was a member. 

 His reports came to that Assembly, of which I was the chairman. And Artemus Lamb, in the selfsame spirit of cooperation, obedience and loyalty to the Administrative Order, however immature its Local Institution was at the time, had himself officially transferred to the Santiago Community, and then went out to work shoulder to shoulder with Este-ban,  under the auspices of Santiago in Puma Arenas.


<p720>
720             THE BAHA'I WORLD

     When the Punta Arenas      

 Assembly had been brought into being by the unstinting self-sacrifices of these two intrepid pioneers, both Assemblies next simultaneously turned their attention, with the Guardian's approval, to Valparaiso. 

 Santiago, being the nearer of the two, sent three members of its own Assembly on weekly teaching trips, and it was precisely when the attitude of complete cooperation with that Assembly began to weaken, that the trouble which subsequently developed in Valparaiso began to cast its shadow. 

 I am dwelling on this theme with complete  candour to show that the success of the teaching work in Chile has been due to complete cooperation with the institutions of the Divine Plan there, and that, conversely,  whenever trouble, or setbacks occurred,  the cause lay in the lack of cooperation with the Spiritual Assembly. 

 I feel that there is a lesson for the future in this for all of us who are called upon to devise ways and means to fling far and wide over the earth these Divine Institutions, and make them function. It may superficially seem bad judgment to place heavy responsibility upon an immature Assembly, or to demand absolute obedience to it, while its frailties are manifest to all. But the power of the Spirit flows from this source, and if we, even well-meaningly,  disregard it, it seems that the growth and expansion of the Cause ceases. 

 I feel one should not deduce from this the principle that in the Baha'i Community the stronger servants are put at disadvantage, but that if they obey impersonally the institution  that is the perfect archtype, and keystone of the New Civilization, then they, the strong ones, by this sacrificial act of spiritual discipline, reinforce in reverse the individuals composing the Assembly, and themselves receive the benefit in the subsequent outflow of a new vigor from the institution. 

 The merely temporary restraint on action which obedience entails, or the direction of action which may seem ill-ad-vised at the time, should be accepted in the interest of the growth of the 

Administrative Body. For   

 we seek two simultaneous, and interdependent things to make the Faith known, and to multiply the Assemblies but also to make of the 

Administration a           

 mature, responsible medium for the success of the former. The spiritual ttattitude" which makes restraint possible is in itself a maturing process, and a much needed personal discipline. Thus, fortunately for the experiment, all the local teachers or pioneers sent out by Santiago, regardless of any certain privileged status which they might reasonably have assumed, were capable of this healthy spiritual attitude. And it is to this, after due and joyous acknowledgment of the Guardian's own inestimable contribution, that the successful founding of the Baha'i Administrative Order in Chile is due. 

 Is it not indeed this very attitude which made possible his own contribution? 

 Love for the Guardian the necessary foundation for the love for, and obedience to, the Administrative Order, which it is one of his prime functions as Guardian to establish, is the mainspring from which surges the spiritual attitude mentioned above. 

 Esteban with his great capacity, Artemus who so joyously and unquestioningly placed himself under the direction of an immature Assembly, arc two who, because of experience  and quality of service, might have disregarded  or depreciated the guidance of the Assembly but who, on the contrary, in the Lulness of their devotion to the Guardian and the Administrative Order, placed themselves  humbly and eagerly under the aegis of an Assembly which was having sufficient difficulties in maintaining itself, let alone participate in the establishment of others! 

 As an integral part of this same attitude, we can also point out Chile's action in sending  a national delegate to the first 

Latin American Baha'i      

 Congress at Panama this past January. This action was an attempt by the majority of the Chilean Believers, through the initiative of the Santiago Assembly,  to build a larger consciousness through attitude to please the Guardian by doing something larger, within the spirit of the Administration, than he had yet requested from us. That this action brought about a major crisis within the Chilean Baha'i Community is proof of the soundness of its major prem-me, for the very crisis produced a consolidation  of the weakest point, precisely where

  A Cappella Choir at Louhelen Baha'i School, Davison, Michigan, LI. S. A. the oniy oblection to the plan had been raised, and put an end, once and for all, to the minority issue, which had been plaguing our Santiago Assembly since its inception. 

 I can write of this all cooiiy and objectively now that it is "in focus," but to experience these evolutionary crises is to "kfloW" the creative process which is building the Divine Order.. with its tremendous strain upon the souls of all involved. That the casualties resulting from its violence are so relatively few in Chile, is largely due to the vigor of the 

Chilean believer. As      

 we say in North America, he can "take it." Once thoroughly aroused to the Truth of, and to the deepest implications of, the Faith, the Chilean is like a North American in his impetuosity and untiring efforts. Until he is, however, so aroused, he can think of more ways to obstruct and make trouble than ten North 

Americans!                

 This latter propensity produced, as I have already intimated, our major internal administrative problem that greatest prob-1cm  confronting all organizations seeking integral unity namely the issue of the minority opinion, and its corollary, constant agitation. 

 Conceivably the most important contribu-don  to functioning, permanent unity which Baha'u'llah has bequeathed to us in His Divine Plan, is His way of resolving this problem. And only could even this method be feasible through a Plan whose mainspring is the power of God Himself for what other power is capable of transforming human  nature so as to enable man to dominate the egoistic tendency of insisting on retaining the right to his own opinion, and to maintain it through agitation, in spite of a contrary majority vote? This tendency strikes at the very heart of all plans for


<p722>
722             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  world unity. Only in the Plan of Baha'u'llah do we find at once the solution, and the power to bring it about, of this acute prob-1cm. 

 The complete and generous cooperation of the former minority on an Assembly with the decision voted by the maiority is the sina qua non of real unity, and oniy the Faith of Baha'u'llah, as we have said above, can, or does, demand it. But even here, since human nature does not change overnight, the minority problem continues to present diii-culties. 

 Until the believers composing the Assemblies are matured in the Teachings, frced of egotism through the love of God, and completely conscious of their duties and obligations toward the Communities, the problem will continually present itself. For only an entirely confirmed heart and a spirit imbued with a sense of obedience; in short, ordy a mature Baha'i, can so overcome his conviction of the rightness of his own opinion as to enable him to cooperate entirely with the majority in carrying out a decision which he was, and still is, convinced is an erroneous one. Even as the Guardian himself has recently explained, CtVne Cause is perfect, but its instruments, (ourselves) are as yet imperfect." When we become better instruments the Cause will show forth its true power and perfection. 

 Hence, our teaching efforts developed around the idea that to interest persons capable of maturing quickly in the Faith, the Teachings should be presented in a mature manner. We all tried to present them as a "whole." We did not stress any particular aspect, but tried to give a complete, whole picture of the Great 

Plan of God for This Day   

 a new Vision, which incorporates the whole social, religious, economic, spiritual  and moral man, in a Divine Plan for his happiness and development. This method made it possible to attract aft kinds of peo-pie,  since it did not limit, even for a moment,  the scope of their own imagination. The Chilean is particularly capable of this kind of teaching. 

 The Faith therefore, is known in Chile for exactly what it is. There is no confusion as to its identity. It is free of persons, who having a half view of it, retain old loyalties which vitiate its strength. 

 To deflect as much as possible the inevitable tendency to personalize everything in a young Community, independent Centers were established as soon as possible. 

 These last two years have seen the three Chilean Spiritual Assemblies move into their own Centers. 

 All these three Spiritual Assemblies have their respective committees, such as Program  and Center 

Committee; Teaching; Publicity

 and Radio; Youth; Feast; and between  them they have appointed what amounts to tcNati 1~ Committees of Teaching, Radio, and Legal Counsel.., the principal work of the Legal Committee being  that of studying, in relation to the laws of the country, a petition for Personeria Juridica, or Incorporation Papers, from the State. 

 But one curious aspect of the Faith in Chile is that it appears each Community has a different teaching function in relation to its own area. 

 Since in the foregoing Santiago has been amply treated, we will be brief in treating of its function and field. 

 In Santiago the work is principally in the intellectual, artistic and educational circles. It would be difficult to find a person belonging to these categories who does not know of the Cause. 

 The presentation of the Faith at the University in May of 1941 reached over four hundred of these people. 

 A complete set of Baha'i Books in the Spanish language has been placed in the National 

Library in Santiago;       

 and the Director  of this Library wrote our Spiritual Assembly the most courteous and appreciative  letter of thanks and official acceptance. Santiago also placed a similar set of books in the Municipal Library of Punta Arenas, which gift was similarly acknowledged by the Mayor himself. 

 The first radio work in Chile was also commenced in Santiago in 1941, Consisting of an Introduction to the Program featuring selections from the Guardian's Writings regarding our aims and purposes, followed by Questions and Answers. the questions sent in by the listening audience. 

 Later, on the same program selections from Baha'u'llah, and 'Abdu'l-Baha were read. This program, which we owed to the generosity of a non-Bahi'i friend, was discontinued


<p723>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS              723

  after several months due to the fact that the Spiritual Assembly at that time was not sufficiently consolidated to permit of its being carried on. We had early secured the generous support  of newspapers and several magazines, which had carried articles and interviews, and which always extended their columns to us when we needed space for visiting Baha'is, or cared to contribute articles about the Faith. 

 All of the foregoing reached that cer-tian portion of the public aforementioned. 

 We have, incidentally, just heard that to Santiago, fittingly enough, has now fallen the great privilege and responsibility of editing  the Latin-American Bulletin, which was commenced, and edited to date, at Panama; and a letter reaching me today confirms the great generosity of one of our newer Santiago  Believers, a member of the Spiritual Assembly. 

Mrs. Fabienne Guillon     

 has officially  presented to the Faith a piece of property  at Loncoche, Chile, consisting of ninety thousand square meters. This is part of a larger property belonging to Mrs. Guillon, and the whole is one of the most beautiful, scenic properties in southern Chile. 

 This niarvelous gift may eventually serve as the site for Chile's first Mashriqu'l-Adhkar,  but meanwhile will be improved, to serve as a IBah&'i 

Summer School.            
     The Community of Punta    

 Arenas apparently  has the teaching mission of reaching the masses. 

 Through its amazing radio success,  Punta Arenas has indeed set such a noteworthy example to her sister communities  that her story warrants here a special, detailed mention. 

 For it is a saga of bold and courageous action, of Lustrous Faith, of unity of effort, and above all, of a unique sense of coordination. 

 In January of 1945 the first radio work for our beloved Cause commenced in that isolated land. 

 The very first step which Artemus and Esteban took was confirmed! In contacting the various radio stations, they met the Director of Radio Polar, Mr. Hugo Arteagabetia. 

 This interview with him proved the bell that rang up the curtain on our Baha'i drama of radio in Punta Arenas. Hugo became fascinated at once with the possibilities inherent in such a program as our two pioneers outlined, and offered not oniy the facilities of Radio Polar, but also all the cooperation of his artistic, sensitive nature. 

 Then a name list was drawn up of all the persons whom the three of us had interested  in the Cause during the past eighteen months. It was an extensive list! When the radio time had been established, beautifully worded invitations were then sent out, asking  these people to listen in on the projected program. 

 One of the most characteristic things about these invitations was that they bore the following words, ~~undcr the auspices of the Baha Spiritual Assembly of 

Santiago."               

 Next the cooperation of the press was sought, and through the unforgettable kindness  of the editor and publisher of 13! Magallanes, Mr. Andrade, publicity was arranged,  with followup articles and comments. 

 From this procedure grew the publishing  of pamphlets, which the presses of this same friendly newspaper printed. 

 The above is an indication of the way in which every effort was coordinated, in the Punta Arenas work, and which brought about the lively interest of a large public. Later, when we were to launch a series of public lectures, we were able to draw on this same fund of goodwill and interest. Surely this is a remarkable piece of work, and since I had personally nothing whatsoever to do with it, I can allow my admiration and praise full rein! It is so evident that every step was guided and confirmed by divine assistance,  and sustained from on High! 

 Thus it came about that by February twentieth of 1945 the Baha'i radio program, "The City of Certitude," went on the air. It was conceived as a series of nine informal roundtable discussions pertaining to world problems, applying as the solution, the twelve basic Baha'i principles. 

 The Faith itself was not mentioned directly until the eighth audition. 

 The participants in this program were, with the exception of Esteban Canales, all non-BaM'is. 

 Since they made Baha'i History,  I am going to name them, for the recompense which Baha'u'llah had destined for them was confirmation in His Faith! 

 The following are the names of those, "brothers and sisters who are unfurling the Banner of


<p724>
724             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  the Faith in Magallanes," and who are among those whom the Guardian himself saw fit to designate as ~tscrvants worthy of the Name of 'Abdu'l-Baha": Hugo Arteagabetia and his gifted wife, Liii; Esteban 

Canales; Rosi Vodanovic;  

 my own faithful friend and devoted  servant of Baha'u'llah, Raid Villagran; and Maria Hernandez. To this list must be added the name of Artemus Lamb (how shall I describe him?) who, while he did not take actual part in the program, was the instigator and patron of it. Since all these friends have great talent, this program was notable for the exquisite beauty of its presentation, its artistic quality,  worthy insofar as human effort can be worthy, of the sublimity of its purpose and the inestimable treasure of its content. The music selected as the Baha'i 

"Theme Song"              

 the melodious and trained voices, the cctiming,~~ and the infinite tact with which the Teachings were presented, taken together  made of this program something to be eagerly listened to by the culture hungry people of a far and isolated land. 

 The eighth and ninth audition presented the identity of the Faith, and terminated shortly before the deadline for the formation of the yearned-for Spiritual Assembly. There were still no enrolled Baha'is! 

 But Baha'i Youth Day was celebrated about this time, coordinated with our Santiago Youth Celebration, at the Hotel Cosmos twenty people attended. Then, Naw-Riiz was celebrated  by an international festival inaugurating  the Salon of Radio Polar. The entire program was arranged by the Baha'is and their friends. Esteban read a short talk on the Faith; Rosi read extracts from the Wisdom  of 'Abdu'l-Baha and recited a poem; Hugo gave comic dialogue and acted as Master of Ceremonies. 

 It proved a joyous occasion, with eighty guests attending. 

 The entire program was broadcast! 

 Still no Baha'is! The     

 Guardian had cabled Arternus in February, !tFervently praying early fprmation 

Assembly." On April 5th   

 a letter came, ~ may rest assured that his prayers will certainly sustain you both in your efforts to establish an Assembly there in April of this year." 

 On April 16th, at a small party celebrating  Esteban's birthday, the bounty of God became manifest. Eight persons declared their desire to become members of the Faith. The first to sign was Raul Villagran, who had spared no effort to help me in my long and lonely vigil in Punta Arenas and who had accompanied me, with spiritual fragrance, in several Nineteen Day Feasts. The second person was also a personal friend, Lina Smithson,  now residing in Iquiqui, Chile; the rest were, Rosi Vodanovic, 

Hugo Arteagabetia, Julio  

 Cesar Villagran, Mrs. Antonia Vodano-vic,  Mrs. Wilhelmina Williams, and Olaf Arentsen. 

 On April twentieth the first Baha'i Spiritual Assembly of Punta Arenas, Chile, was elected all the above participating, including  Esteban and Artemus. Chile thus had reached her second Local 

Spiritual Assembly.  Her 

 Capital was now spiritually united with her far, southern extremity. 

 To me, as I write, the poignancy of remembering the dear, radiant faith in the Guardian's prayers, which runs through this period like a mystic accompaniment, brings tears to my eyes. 

 In July the second series of the "City of Certitude," went on the air, over the same radio but this time under the auspices of the Spiritual Assembly of Punta Arenas! This series consisted of nine informal conversations between three Baha'is covering the field of daily problems. These were discussed  from the Baha'i standpoint, and definite  Baha'i Teachings clearly applied. The consensus of opinion was that this second series attracted more listeners than the first. (The first had attracted and confirmed the persons Baha'u'llah had destined to form the Spiritual Assembly.) 

 In October the program, cejewels from Baha'i Literature," was broadcast over radio, "La Voz del Sin." This program was especially  beautiful. 

 Magallanes is an ideal field for teaching by radio. The peculiar life of the place; its remoteness, its lack of cultural facilities; the hunger of a people living in a purely materialistic environment for the things of the spirit; the fierce, relentless weather with its high winds, storms, rain, snow and intense cold; making home the center  of activity; the vast, farfiung and lonely CCEstancias~~; the sad, mysterious pall of a violent past which hangs over the entire

  region; all these things, pius a hundred others, make it as different from Northern Chile as night from day, and contribute to form an ideal field for radio. All that was needed was what Esteban and Artemus, and indeed, all the friends, had in abundance: courage, love for the Faith and "a burning desire to tell it to others," an enthusiasm and a conviction par excellence. Truly, I feel that never has such a spirit been more glori-ousiy  vindicated than there in that sad, remote  land. 

 In January of 1946, again over Radio Polar, a class in English was contributed jointly by this Station and the 

Baha Spiritual  Assembly.
From June 15th to September 

 5th of 1945, other special programs had been presented by the Spiritual Assembly. These were dramatic presentations of the Faith, with a musical background; Baha'i prophecies and writings, and a special program  to commemorate the celebrated Conference of San Francisco, and the termination  of the 

War in Europe.             

 All of this great variety of radio programs were conceived, written, acted and presented by the Baha'is themselves. In addition to the radio work, the 

Spiritual Assembly of Punta

 Arenas published the first, and so far oniy, pamphlets on the Faith in Chile. These were devoted to seven different subjects: 

The Baha'is Seek World     
Unity; The Dawn of a New   
Civilization; The Base     
for a New Civilization;   

Strikes; War or Peace;     

 and, The Reality of Man and The Laboratory of a New Civilization the last two being mimeographed copies of the first two public talks given under the auspices of the Assembly in the Municipal Library in Punta Arenas. All these pamphlets were printed and widely distributed in Magallanes, and generously forwarded in large quantities to both Santiago and Valparaiso. 

 When I returned to Magallanes from the work in Valparaiso, in October of 1945, Radio Polar was broadcasting still another Baha'i program. 

 This was the first time I heard with my own ears the Word of God come over the ether in Punta Arenas. 

 The program was, "A Baha'i Comments on the News." 

 Hugo Arteagabetia, then a member of that Assembly, was the Commentator, and he himself wrote these ttt~ How shall I describe the deep thrill which stirred my soui as I listened to this truly inspired program, and fully realized that, in this strange land where I had spent fifteen such lonely and seemingly fruitless months ... 

 where my only terrestrial companion was my Guardian where without his invisible, unfailing support, my very soul would have fainted away the New Revelation was literally "in the very air"? 

 There are some things far too deep for words things which oniy spirit can communicate  to spirit. 

 I shall only say here that my one conscious thought was, "Oh, if only Shoghi Effendi could be listening to this!" 

 I had the further joy of listening to still another 

Baha'i program! Every       
Wednesday Rosi Vodanovic   

 would read for fifteen minutes  from the Sacred Writings and the Love of God went over the air and into the hearts through her! 

 My happiness in meeting these glorious new brothers and sisters simply knew no bounds. I had once written that those who would rise up to accept the Faith there, would need be stalwart souis indeed! 

 And so I found them! Brave, clean, windswept spirits! 

 At this particular time, the possibility which the Guardian had foreseen, and of which he had warned the believers in his reply to their first communication to him namely, the threat to the Assembly status through unavoidable changes of residence, became a reality. 

 It constituted the first real crisis the Assembly had had to face. Punta Arenas has a top layer of floating population northern Chileans who spend a few years, or months there. (Such arc the rigors of the climate that business concerns, and the Government itself, do not allow their employees to remain too long there!) This circumstance is both a help and a hindrance to the Baha'i work. It is a help since those who hear of the Faith there take it north with them. It is a drawback because it is a constant threat to the Assembly status as long as the Community is not sufficiently large to compensate for such a loss of members. 

 I had felt that perhaps one of the reasons which the Guardian had had for putting


<p726>
726             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  such stress upon the importance of the Ma-gallanes  work was that he had foreseen the eventuality of the 

Baha'i Community of Punta 

 Arenas serving as a source of spiritual transfusion for the weary Community of Santiago. For, due to the blessed, in this case, isolation of Magallanes, the work there, from start to finish, had been completely free from the type of interference suffered in the Capital. It developed along its natural course in an atmosphere that was, spiritually speaking, completely pure, and the believers who brought the Assembly into being were imbued  with such a sense of unity between them, of sacrifice and detachment, that the Assembly was a truly Baha'i Body. 

 Whereas in the Capital, the Faith had had to contend with such multiple and serious difficulties arising out of sources completely outside of its control, that it had lost some of its spiritual  buoyancy and pristine vigor. Thus, the arrival of several of these strong, vigorous, windswept souls from the south certainly brought to it a new dynamism. 

 Now, in October of 1945, Punta Arenas was about to lose five of its Assembly members  to the North. 

 After consultation with the Assembly, we planned a public campaign for new members; a series of thee widely publicized lectures. Two of these we arranged  to hold in the Municipal Library, through the kindness of the Mayor of Punta Arenas; and with the third we planned to inaugurate the Center which we did not have! 

 While arranging the lectures, and the publicity,  we found the Center, and through this providential cs the first official, independent  Baha'i Center of Punta Arenas was inaugurated! 

 The sensation I had, when standing, facing  a large and sympathetic audience, in our very own Baha'i Center in a city which I had left a year before with absolutely nothing accomplished on the outer plane addressing this miraculous audience under the auspices of the Spiritual Assembly of Punta Arenas was one of complete and undiluted awe! What I had left, apparently  a desert, I had returned to find a rose garden! My only conscious thought was of the Guardian. A cherished desire of his had been realized the Guardian's Presence pervaded the region, and the Moon of the Covenant rose high full and luminous above the horizon of that God-blessed land. 

 'When the time to say farewell came, the Assembly status had been secured. 

 The Valparaiso  work was calling me back Este-ban was returning to Santiago. 

 Rosi and her mother were likewise bound for the Capital. 

 Lina Smithson was leaving to settle in Iquiqui. 

The original Punta Arenas 

 Assembly  was sendin~' forth some of its fairest flowers to grace the communities of the NortL Hugo Arteagabetia was leaving to join his family in Valparaiso, where his wife had become a member of the original group there. Before all of us sailed away, Artemus, Esteban and myself, finding ourselves together  for the first time, had our pictures taken. 

 We were not to be together again, all three of us, until the eve of my departure for Central America but in spirit, we are always one. 

 Returning to Valparaiso, we continued the work toward the formation of a third Assembly  there. 

 The group had been officially formed the previous JuLy 14th, with its duly elected officers. The first Valparaiso Baha'i was Rosina Vifiucla, who learned of the Faith on a trip to Punta Arenas. 
The other members  were: 

Liii Arteagabetia; Rosita 

 Caro; Millicent Bravo, one of the first Santiago Baha'is; Oscar Frank; Carlos and Julia Bulling  Petersen, with their four beautiful children;  Mrs. Elvira Odd6, and Mr. Gottfried Brander. 

 To this group now came Hugo Arteagabetia, and later Esteban Canales. 

 One can see that not oniy does Valparaiso represent the spiritual unity of endeavor between Santiago and Punta Arenas, but physically, in its very membership, those two corn-niunities  are represented. 

    Valparaiso reached Assembly

 status in the elections of April 20th, 1946. 

 It proved a very difficult field, the most difficult one, and it was brought to Assembly status that year through the unstinting, heroic efforts of Esteban 

Ganales.                  

 Valparaiso's mission is a very special one. The formation of this Assembly is something of a miracle brought about by the Guardian. It is also a mystery~ It entailed certain preliminary  skirmishes which have no place in

  Recreation grounds at Louhelen Baha'i School, Davison, Michigan, U. S. A. this paper, but which resulted in total victory for the Faith so that the Guardian could include in his magnificent cable to this first Valparaiso Assembly, the significant words, CCHistoric triumph." 

 'X~hat a thrilling few days followed that election! 

 The cable offices in Chile certainly bad a field day! (They are already so familiar 'with the Cause and the Baha'is that when a cable arrives for a certain Baha'i the office checks with any Baha'i and asks where such and such a person is working for the Faith at the moment.) Cables flew from Punta Arenas, Valparaiso and Santiago to Haifa and from Haifa caine the blessed replies; they flew from Punta Arenas to Santiago to Valparaiso and return, making a lovely circuit of loving unity expressed in congratulations, and bearing the news of the results of each Community's election. 

 They flew to Wilmette, during the National Convention Lhefl in session. 

 Yes, that was a very special moment in the history of the Faith in Chile. 

 The blessed Cause of God threw off once and for all the shackles that had bound it, and stepped forth triumphant, purified, whole. 

 And then, for me, came the Guardian's cable, approving my service in Central America, and asking me for this account of the last two full, violent, but glorious years. 
     I was ready to leave.     

 An era had ended in Chile an era whose outer close is symbolized  this day by the sad news that Chile's valiant but curiously unappreciated President, his Excellency Don Juan Antonio Rios, is dead. 

 His passing is a matter of particular regret to the Chilean Baha'i Community. For to him, as President of the Nation, the Spiritual Assembly of Santiago, in the name of the Chilean Baha'i Community, had presented  the Tablet which 'Abdu'l-Baha had sent to a Chilean woman throu&~ 

Martha                    

 Root in 1920. We know it as the ~Tab1et

  to Chile." Our Assembly had this Tablet beautifully translated into the Spanish language.  Then to Mr. Joaquin Macias, artist and friend, was entrusted the work of giving it a worthy setting. 

 Mr. Macias, in order to faithfully execute this trust proceeded to study the Faith, particularly the ttDawn Breakers," and old Persian tapestries as well! The result of his loving and painstaking efforts was a true and gorgeous work of art. Then the Assembly appointed a committee, which was granted an interview with President Rios. 

 At this interview Eugenia Herrera presented the Tablet to him with an accompanying explanation.  His attitude of comprehension, courtesy and respect as he listened to this Chilean Baha'is words, and then reverently picked up the Tablet, did him credit. Now Juan Antonio Rios is dead.. to the world. But the Baha'is are certain that he has also received life. 'We pray that God may receive his soui and that his spirit, comprehending the full import of the Tablet he received, may work from the unseen realm, together with us of Chile, for her future glory in the Cause of God. 

 Dead, but surely living also, is our great and highly-regarded friend, 

Don Domingo Melfi, Director
of the newspaper La Na-don. 

 His assistance to us cannot be estimated, and his great qualities of justice, generosity, and open-mindedness will con —  tinue to warrant the gratitude of every Baha'i in Chile, whether of the past, or of the future. 

 My beloved friend, and editor, Charles Paddock is also dead. He who so generously gave us our firt start in the news world, without which our path in Chile would have been a very different, and infinitely more difficult, one. Yes, an era had ended so many deaths so intimately connected with the Faith. Have I too, died? In a sense I think so for in leaving my beloved  Chile, I left a large part of myself. 

 But before leaving I had shared the immense  joy of Mason Remey's visit. 

 Mason, on his historic trip throughout South America,  visiting all the Baha'i Assemblies and groups, brought, if his presence in Chile is any criterion, which I am sure it is, a very special and much needed bounty. 

 His ciose association with the Master made him the bearer of a spirit which I do not exaggerate when I say consisted of spiritual healing. At least, that is the only way I can describe the effect of his presence upon us in Chile. We sensed that subtle, undefinable but potent assurance  which those who knew 'Abdu'l-Baha possess ... perhaps it comes from a deep tranquillity whose spring lies in another, luminous world. 

 Surely those to whom fell the priceless privilege of knowing, in His earthly form, the Mystery of God, could not have left His Presence unchanged. 

 For they knew Heaven on earth and this is the gift they bear us, and this is what Mason brought us. I remember his face when I asked, Ctwh did you decide to make this long, taxing journey?" He replied, "I thought it might please the Guardian." May I here, for history, acknowledge Chile's debt to this faithful servant of the Guardian, and say that he will live forever in the hearts of the Baha'is of Punta Arenas, Santiago and Yalparaiso. 

 Now, as I sit here, in a room, in San Jos6, Costa Rica, I realize that I have remembered  all that I had forgotten. 

 And all the faces come once more before me the faces of those devoted companions who now carry the blessed burden of an infinitely precious mission. 

 That an immense labor is needed to coordinate, maintain and expand the victories  gained is evident. 

 But I dare to hope that the unfailing support and illumination of Baha'u'llah will sustain and reinforce them. 

 Something now stirs within me, the sheer happiness of knowing and remembering how the Spirit moved and worked, using us all in its unpredictable and unerring way, for Its Divine Purpose, producing in me now an exultation of soui to have been privileged to have watched its manifold wonders wonders that rained down like showers of light when the way was darkest rained down like the Guardian's sacred prayers for us all, revitalizing all dying, faltering things!

           BAHA'I ORDER AND SOCIAL JUSTICE

  B~ PROF. K. T. SHAH IT IS generally agreed that much of the present social discontent is due to the enormous  difference in the means of ensuring worldly happiness, as between those who have and those who have not. Those who have exploit the poverty of those who have not; and those who have not retaliate by the only means in their power: hatred of those who enslave and exploit them; discontent  with the entire social order which tolerates  and encourages such injustice; and passive resistance in the shape of malingering to secure for themselves the greatest return for the least effort. 

 Class war is thus rampant in every industrialized country, even when outwardly the people are at peace under an orderly government. 

 This phenomenon is not confined to individuals only. Nations, or rival powers, fight among themselves, and bring death and destruction to countless men and material, to attain or maintain their own power to dominate and exploit those weaker than themselves.  Class hatred culminates in frequent strikes and lockouts; while international rivalries manifest themselves in wars which have thus become the order of the day. 

 Mere Palliatives. The remedies devised to meet this unending disease prove hardly more than mere palliatives, since the root of the disease is untouched. This root lies in the initial injustice of the individualist society. 

 It may not be a divine commandment that to him who bath shall be given, and from him who hath not shall be taken away the mite he possesses; but it seems to have become the religion of civilized (?) mankind  all over the globe. Industrialization, admirably, designed to end the deficit, operates  under the social system with the only motive power in personal gain as a curse for the worker. 

 Every social reform — like the liberation of the serfs in Tzarist Russia, or the emancipation of the slaves in America, results in a deeper enslavement and heavier exploitation. For the liberator never provided ided against the ingenuity of the profit-seeker, who twists the hard earned personal freedom of the serf of the Negro to turn him into a wage-slave of the worst kind. 

 Only Remedy. The remedy for this state of things, however, lies not in the tinkering, which has recently been attempted, like doles for the unemployed. Nor will the method of the strike and the lockout soive the tangle; but will oniy add to the feeling of hatred and distrust on either side. Work will be impeded, production inevitably curtailed, and the means of ensuring the material wellbeing  of the people reduced. Scientists have calculated — and Prophets, like Baha'u'llah, have proclaimed, that: "were all the work, whether of brain or hand, of a nature profitable  to mankind, the supplies of everything necessary for a healthy, comfortable and noble life would amply suffice for all." But all do not work; nor is all work equally productive. 

 The possessing classes have created a monopoly of the means of production, which they permit to be utilized on condition  that they themselves need not labor, but be fed and clothed and sheltered in superabundance as parasites and incubi. 

 But the trouble is just there. Neither scientist nor prophets are heeded in the insensate,  incessant search for personal profit and endless accumulation of worldly wealth. Until men learn to think not only, — nor even primarily, of themselves; until they realize that in the good of all lies the good of each, there can be no effective and abiding soiu-tion  of this most prominent evil of our days; Says the Prophet 

Baha'u'llah:                 
 ttoh ~C Sons of intelligence!

 The thin eyelid  prevents the eye from seeing the world and what is contained therein. Then think of the result when the curtain of greed covers  the sight of the heart!" 

 This Prophet was born in the backward land of Persia 12 5 years ago, when industrialization was even a name in that land of darkness, ignorance and superstition. But


<p730>
730             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The Honorable Robert W. Kenny, Attorney General of the State of California, addressed an audience of Baha'is and their friends, as part of the program of the Baha'i Summer School at Geyserville, July, 1945. The meeting was held in the auditorium of the school. 

  He was gifted with a divine vision; and in the midst of persecution and exile. 

 He saw the evil genius hovering on the horizon; and uttered His prophetic warnings against it. He has, at the same time, held out hopes of a better order. For ttSoon," He says, ~twi11 the present order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead." That New Order, assuring and providing the comfort and happiness and peace of all mankind, is founded on the rock of justice between man and man. The demands of social justice have hitherto been obscured or denied because of the all-pervading cloud of selfishness and greed. 

    Down with Inequalities.    

 The deepest root of this injustice lies in the inequalities of the means of material happiness available to every human being. !CPt shall disappear, says Abdu'l-Baha, the son and successor  of the Prophet. The existing inequalities  he unreservedly condemns. And though he does not think absolute equality, in point of material wealth, either practicable or desirabLe, he has no doubt that: "It is important to limit riches, as it is also of importance to limit poverty." 

 ~The rich must give of their abundance; they must soften their hearts, and cultivate a compassionate intelligence, taking thought for those sad ones who are suffering from the lack of the very necessaries of life." 

 This may sound as no more than what every religious teacher his inculcated from Buddha and Confucious to Baha'u'llah. But where Baha'u'llah scores over His predecessors  and contemporaries, is in His more workmanlike attitude towards the problem as a whole. The long range remedy, He knows, must lie in better education of the masses, and deeper understanding of the working of Divine Providence in all such matters. With that knowledge oniy can come that sense of sympathy and identity of interest

  as well as ideal or objective between all mankind,  without which all endeavors to remedy the wrong of ages must prove vain and fruitless. 

 Baha'u'llah lays the immediate foundation  of the New Order on voluntary sharing and copartnership as between the employers and the employed. 

 Says 'Abdu'l-Baha in a letter to The Central Organization for a Durable Peace (1919): "Among the teachings of 

Baha'u'llah is Voluntary   

 Sharing of one's property with others among mankind. 

 One should not prefer oneself to others, but rather should sacrifice one's life and property for others. But this should not be introduced by coercion so that it becomes a law which man is compelled to follow. Nay, rather man should voluntarily and of his own choice sacrifice his property and life for others, and spend willingly for the poor, just as is done in Persia among the is. 

    Slavery Forbidden. As a    

 corollary to this injunction to share is the command that all should work. Every one, capable and qualified, should engage in some useful and productive work. There must be no drones in the social hive nor able-bodied parasites, men or women, Baha'u'llah does not deny the right to riches, justly acquired and rightly used~ The rich must learn to be trustees of their wealth, acquired from the labors of their fellows; and must devote it to the service and the happiness of the people. Every service rendered and work done, should be ade quately remunerated, so that there be neither slums nor starvation. In the book of Aqdas Baha'u'llah has definitely forbidden slavery; and His son and successor, 'Abdu'l-Baha, has explained that to include not oniy chattel slavery but wage-slavery as well. 

 Lecturing in the United States, he observed in 1912: "Between 1860 and 1863 you did'a wonderful  thing; you abolished chattel slavery, but today you must do a much more wonderful thing; you must abolish industrial slavery." 

   Employees as Partners.     

 He explained the Divine Law in such matters, to be that employees  should not be paid merely by wages. Nay, rather they should be partners in every work. The owners of properties, mines and factories, should share their incomes with their employees, and give a certain percentage of their profits to their workingmen. 

 The new society of Baha'i design would, thus, be founded on a sort of mutual cooperation,  inherent in the nature of man, and replace the present incessant competition by copartnership. 

 Men must join in a common endeavor for the benefit of all, under the aegis of a single World Sovereign State guided by an International House of Justice, which shall follow the injunctions of the Prophet, and so lead mankind to that perfection of worldly ease and happiness which is but vainly sought under the present unsocial dispensation.

             B~ JOHN CARL EICHENAUER III

  "SHOULD a man, all alone, arise in the name of Baha, and put on the armor of His love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious,  though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed against him." — Baha'u'llah. 

 Did you ever look ahead and say, ttWhere will I be serving Baha'u'llah one year from today?" 

 "What exciting events are in store for me?" 

 Little did I dream on October 6, 1944, as we sailed from New York City, that one year later I would be in the heart of Germany, participating at once in the establishment of the Lesser Peace by service in the occupation forces of the United Nations, and in the foundation of the Most Great Peace by assisting the reorganization of Baha'i activities in Germany and Austria, for eight long years prohibited by a corrupt and nationalistic regime.

  with my dear Baha'i brother, Sgt. Bruce Davison of Miami, Florida, and first met the Baha'is in Frankfurt and Darmstadt; and October 20, 1945, observance of the 126th Anniversary of the Birthday of the Bab with my Baha'i buddy, Cal, and the Baha'is of Stuttgart. Almost every day was highlighted by the receipt of a letter from some far-flung  outpost of the Faith; Hobart, 

Tasmania;  Ancon, Panama  
Canal Zone; BaghdAd,      

'Iniq; Montreal, Canada;   

 Sydney, Australia; London, England; Tegucigalpa, Honduras, as well as many from Baha'i Centers in the United States and Canada, including my beloved spiritual family in Phoenix, Arizona. 

 Unbelievably reinvigorating is even the most cursory note of Baha'i progress in other lands. Some sent money, some sent literature, and others sent food; ever-present was the indissoluble bond of ttYa Bah~'u'1-AbM." 

 As we entered the beautiful harbor of Marseilles, France, a feeling of the mission with which I was to be entrusted descended upon me. Calvin Wilder, then a seeker, and I had observed the holy Anniversary of the Mb's Birth, seated on a hatch at sea amid the wind and spray. On many occasions I prayed for guidance in the coming months. 

 Not having any addresses, it was not possible for me to contact the Baha'is in Marseilles, but I did leave a Baha'i pamphlet with a Theosophist  lady, and repeated the Greatest 

Name in Note Dame Cathedral.

 The church offers a marvelous view of the harbor and city, and awed by the sight, I supplicated that the spirit of the people would be quickened in the service of their Lord. Further religious activities among civilians were limited by military duties in the 100th Infantry 

Division.                 

 "God will assist all those who arise to serve Him." — Baha'u'llah. 

 The Century Division went on the line about November 1, 1944, and continued in action until April 24, 1945. It went into action around Rambervillers, France, participated in the Saar triangle move, crossed the Rhine at Mannheim, took Heil-Bronn, Germany, in some of the hardest fighting of the war, captured the southern part of Stuttgart,  and on VE Day we found ourselves in the area of Geislingen. 

 For over two months I was stationed in Eislingen, a village just outside G6ppingen. We moved to Bad Cannstatt, a suburb of Stuttgart, on July 7, 1945. 

 My small part in military operations as a litter bearer, clerk and laboratory technician in the division clearing station was quite inconspicuous. 

 Our clearing station received casualties from the entire division, evacuating some and maintaining convalescent wards for minor illnesses and injuries. 

 Being located a number of miles from the front, we had only one close call, a strafing by plane near Diemaringen, France. 

 Many were the opportunities to speak of the Baha'i Faith, directly and indirectly, to many soldiers, a few civilians, and a number of liberated Allied prisoners of war, including  natives of India. Most contacts were casual and informal, though I believe a good percentage of lasting impressions were made. 

 While on a tour of guard duty near Raweiler, France, I noticed on a parked truck the unit designation of a Baha'i I had been writing to. A few hours later 

I found Fred Mortensen     
of Chicago, in Saarebourg, France.

 We exchanged experiences for several  hours, and he told me of his first contact with the Paris 

Baha'i on Liberation       
Day, August 22, 1944.      

 Overjoyed and thankful I felt one afternoon in mid-February, when upon returning from a mission as correspondent for the Century Sentinel, our weekly division newspaper, I was given a threeday pass to Paris. At the time we were in Diemaringen, France, and it was an all-day trip by truck to Paris. 

 Arriving in the famous but somewhat  chastened capital on Saturday afternoon, February 16, I soon contacted Miss Edith Sanderson, through the Red Cross. Surprisingly enough, she lived at the same address (12 Rue de 1'Annonciation) and had the same telephone number (Aut 7913) as before the war. We spent the following afternoon together in her apartment exchanging experiences and recalling mutual Baha'i friends, May Maxwell in particular. First in order was the presentation of Baha'i credentials issued to me by the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 

States and Canada. Fortunat'ely
I had copies of God Passes 

By and Baha'i Centenary

  with her for the group, and also a number of Ba1A'i bulletins and pamphlets. 

 She was eager for news of the progress of the 

Cause in America. She     

 looked to be in fairly good health. From her I learned I was the fourth Baha'i to visit the Paris friends since the Liberation. 

 The first was Lix Fred Morten-sen  of Chicago, on Liberation Day. The other two were David Hofman of London, England, and John Asliton of Evanston, 

Illinois.  From Miss Sanderson's

 home I walked a few blocks to Mr. Kennedy's apartment at 6 Rue Leon Bonnat, and was met by a very dear Persian believer, Mr. Parviz Khorsand. His great sincerity and purity of motive impressed me immediately. He was very happy to learn of youth activities in America and to see pictures of the Convention. 

 He is a graduate chemical engineer and was working for Supreme Headquarters 

Allied Expeditionary Forces

 at the time. Mr. Kennedy came about eight o'clock and we spent a joyous three hours talking of the Cause. I was especially interested in his experiences in Turkestan and his visit to the first Baha'i Temple in 'Ishqabad. Of course, it is always a pleasure to meet those who knew 'Abdu'l-Baha.  Mr. Kennedy has not been well, but Parviz seems to be in good health. 

 The next afternoon I met Mrs. Scott, another American believer. In the evening Parviz and I attended one of the "Follies" which brought up a discussion of the Baha'i moral code as explained in The Advent of Divine Justice. After the show we walked and talked until the early hours, discussing current events, the movement of the left, women, and the application of the principles of the Cause to world situations, parting at the Arc Je Triomphe. 

 In these few hours Parviz and I developed a deep friendship. 

 ttAS ye have faith, so shall your powers and blessings be." — 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 Of great joy and personal confirmation of Faith was the embracing of the Faith by a fellow company member, Technician 

Fifth Grade Calvin Lee    

 Wilder, a writer and booklover  from Boston, who has been studying the Cause for over a year. 

 The first Baha'i pamphlet I showed him did not interest him, but we seemed to be thrown together frequently  and our discussiohs nearly always touched some phase of the Teachings, particularly ticularly the relation of literature to religion. 

He celebrated Naw-Riiz    
(Baha'i New Year's Day)   

 with me in Bitche, France, and several times he joined me in the observance of 19-Day Feasts. He is a sincere fellow, slight of build and soft-spoken, but determined in speech and action, and especially devoted to racial amity work. He feels that meeting the Paris friends was the turning point in his search for Truth. He was deeply impressed with their warmth and friendliness. 

 Most surprising, though an exceptional  example of the independent investigation of truth, is his acceptance of the Faith without making the acquaintance of any other American Baha'i. 

 His first Baha'i contact was a German family we found in Esslingen, Julius and Helene Kurz and their children, 

Neckarstrasse 3B. Though  

 we spoke only a few words of German, ccA114h~ u-Abb6," 'Abdu'l-Baha" and the mention of a few mutual friends brought us close together spiritually. We parted with prayers in English and German. Calvin made his declaration of Faith on June 20, 1945, at Esslingen, Germany, and on August 14, 1945, he signed the Baha'i membership card at a prayer meeting we held in my room at 1 

0 Daimlerstrasse, Bad     

 Cannstatt. Since then he has been very active in the Esslingen Baha'i 

Community.                

 Since July 15, 1945, American soldiers have been allowed to talk to Germans in public places, and since October 1, 1945, we are allowed to visit German homes. 

 I have met Baha'is a few blocks from my quarters in Bad Cannstatt; many from Stuttgart, a couple miles away; many from Esslingen, about seven miles distant; from G6ppingen; and from 

Geislingen.               

 It was possible to observe the Anniversary of the Declaration of the Bib with about 20 Baha'is in the Kostlin home, in Esslingen. Those present were Emma Muller, Friedrike Kupperbusch, 

Hildegard Muller, Ruth    

 Es-penlaub,  Emma Loftier, Marie Dittis, Luise Rommel, 

Fridi Schneider, Johanna  

 Raster, Rosa Schafer, Wilhelm Lenz, Kiara Bender, Hugo Bender, Elisabeth Muller, Peter Rom-mel,  Adolf Spieth, 

Johann Schafer, Hermann  

 Rommel, Hildegard Uesch, Marta Weiss, Anna Kostlin, and Helene Kurz. That first occasion I had to speak to a group of

  Believers attending the 1945 Summer Sessions of the Baha'i International School, Temerity Ranch, Colorado, U. S. A. German Baha'is was quite touching. Imagining  how difficult it must have been to suspend  all Baha'i activities when a specific order was issued by the Nazi regime on June 10, 1937, and to bear the shadowing of the Gestapo and the persecution of certain  members because of their religious beliefs, I could read in their faces their great relief to resume Baha'i community life. In glowing terms and with faces reminiscent of heavenly joys once experienced, the believers  asked about the American Baha'is who travelled in Germany before the war, some as early as 1907, Charles 

Mason Remey, Miss Alma     

 S. Knobloch, Roy Wilhelm, Mark Tobey, Lorol Schopilocher, 

George Latimer, Amelia     

 Collins, Charles and Helen Bishop, Fred Kiuss, 

Sylvia Matteson, Ruhanguiz 

 and Jeanne Bolles, and with special admiration, Ruhiyyih Khan~m. How inspiring to see in their guest books the names of the many believers who visited this beautiful region. The friends were very anxious for news of the health of the Guardian and of the progress  of the Cause in America, which I was very happy to convey. 

 Each of the Baha'is is outstanding in some way, but I niust make special mention of Fraulein Anna 

Kostlin and Fraulein       
Marta Weiss. Anna Kostlin  

 is an elderly gray-haired lady with sparklingly sincere eyes and a heartwarming smile, a very devoted handmaiden  of Baha'u'llah. 

 She reminds me of Martha Root, though I never knew her. Her home is the heart of Baha'i activity in Ess —  lingen. She has saved some Baha'i literature in English and German, including the Star of the West. 

 I gave her God Passes By and other Baha'i publications. 

Tiny, cheerful  Marta

  mund Baha'is. Their regular weekly meetings  are held on Tuesday evenings, and Thursday evenings are devoted to youth activities. 

 They ask for literature in English which they will translate into German. 

 A typewritten youth bulletin is already being circulated. 

 Some Baha'i literature has been received from North America and from 

England.                  

 The Anniversary of the Martyrdom of the BTh found me with about thirty 

Baha'is in Stuttgart: Robert
Shuitheiss, Werner Schubert,

Hede Schubert, Dister      

 Schubert, Samuel Hafner, Henrich Walker, Marie 'Walker, Bernhard Hesselmejer, 

Hedwig Hes-selmejer,  Charlotte

 Hesselmejer, Friedrich Schweizer, Anne Marie Schweizer, 

Pauline Bothner, Erida     

 Leidinger, Lina Rothfuss, Anneliese Mirza, Frau Mehi, Adeiheid Koller, Herma Muhlschlegel, 

Ursula Muhlschlegel, Otto  
Geidreich, Agnes Danner,   

Beta HopE-ner,  Birgitt    

 Megerle, Hilde Eberwein, Emma Haas, Paul Golimer, Werner Goilmer, Lilo Goilmer, and Marta Golimer. The program began with the singing of a hymn. Then Frau Leidinger read words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. 

 I repeated the Bib's prayer CtRemover of Difficulties" and then conveyed greetings of the American believers. 

 A number  of questiohs were asked about the progress  of the Cause in other lands. The meeting was closed with !CD Grosste Name" hymn, "Aus frohem I-Ierzen dringt das Wort Des grossten Narnens ewig fort, Und     Maclitig tont's von jedem Ort, AJUh-u-Abh6l C!Das helle Lick das Er gcbracht Das Fuhrt uns weiter in der Naclit, Das     Dunkel weiclit durch seine Mach, A1Uh-u-Abhi! 

  ttAllAh-u-AbM tont es nun Der Hymnus steigt zu Gottes Thron, Und freudig tont. 
es ohne Ruh'n:             

All .6h-u-Abh6 I           

  A picture was then taken. 

 A heavenly spirit pervaded each meeting. Their hospitality was wonderful and all I had to offer was a small amount of chocolate I had saved from my rations. It was quite a delicacy for them. Many items such as soap and sugar have been very scarce and are considered luxuries. 

 Ordinary staples are quite scarce, but nevertheless, when one visits a Baha'i home, he is offered whatever they have, even though it is the last morsel of food in the house. 

 In Stuttgart, Baha activities center around the Golimer home. The building in which their apartment is located was spared whereas those adjacent to it are in rubble. Herr Golimer was the National Treasurer, and it was a great joy to meet him and his dear family. To see the Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha  and Baha'u'llah and many other precious books and archives in German and English that he has saved, having hidden most of them in the cellar to avoid confiscation by the Gestapo, deepened my admiration  for him. 

 He and his wife, Marta; son, Werner; and daughters Agnes and Lilo, and granddaughter, Brigite, look to be in good health. On behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria, Herr Golimer extended me a letter of introduction in visiting other Baha'i communities. 

 Calvin and I observed the Feast of Words with 34 believers in Stuttgart. 

 It was Cal's first Feast Day with a Baha'i community and my first since leaving America, other than those observed with Cal or observed alone. But for the language I felt as though I were attending a Feast Day in America. It was also in the Goilmer home. From a provision which was saved by Frau Golimer for a celebration of peace, tea and cake were served. First a hymn was sung. After readings from the Sacred Writings, Cal and I were asked to say a few words and then I asked all present who knew the Master to give their impressions of his wondrous person. 
A prayer closed the meeting.

 Most memorable is their reverent greeting "GrUss Gott" and affectionate farewell, CtAfidr sehen, AlUh-u-AbliA." 

 My knowledge of German consists of a few words, which is a handicap, but I am studying as military duties allow and hope to carry on a fair conversation by the time I leave. Fortunately, several believers speak English quite well. Dr. Muhlschlegel has already translated

  lated. Several weekly study classes are held by the Stuttgart Baha'is, and include youth meetings and public speaking classes. 

 As early as June 1, 1945, I gave a list of Baha'i names and addresses to the battalion intelligence officer, Capt. Willard F. Seaton, along with quotations from God Passes By about the legal status of the Cause in America and the suppressive measures taken against the Cause in Germany in 1937, when it was outwardly dissolved by a specific order from Himmier. My hope was that after investigation by CounterIntelligence and Military Government, Baha'is could be of assistance in restoring order and in reorienting  the German people. 

  On Monday morning, August 

 13, 1945, Chaplain James Watson, then our battalion chaplain and I spoke with Capt. 

Carvel Busey, Religious   

 Education Officer of a Stuttgart  Military Government about written authorization for Baha'i meetings in Stuttgart,  even though freedom of religion was automatically established by proclamation of 

General Eisenhower. I     

 presented to him the BaEA'i credentials I carried while in Latin America and had at hand for his reference  Baha'i World, 

Vol. V (from Fraulein Anna
Kostlin's library), Faith 

 for Freedom  in English, and The World Religion and Baha'i Principles in German. Capt. Busey was very considerate in answering our questions and suggested that the Chairman of the Local Spiritual Assenibly, llerr Paul Goilmer, and I come to his office for further consultation. 

 He had knowledge of the Teachings through his aunt, a Baha'i of Urbana,  Illinois. 
He spoke of Lt. Col.      

 Keller of the Military Government in Munich, whose wife is a Memphis Baha'i. 

 It was quite fortunate to have one so understanding to speak with. I gave him a list of the Baha'is of Stuttgart and the names and addresses of believers in eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. 

 Our first meeting Lasted for thirty minutes. 

     On Tuesday morning, August

 14, 1945, Chaplain Watson lent me his jeep for the second interview. 

 Tec S Bob Siemens, the chaplain's assistant, and I stopped by for Dr. Adeiheid Koller at the Children's Hospital, and for Herr Paul Golimer at the insurance office where he works. We arrived at the Military Government Office, and were received  a few minutes later. Capt. 
Busey was again very considerate.

 After a few questions, he directed his secretary to type the following letter: ttThis is to certify that the Stuttgart Baha'i religious community has been authorized by this Headquarters to reorganize and to hold religious meetings within the City. 

 ccMr Paul Goilmer, 127 Neckarstrasse, is the Chairman of the Local Spiritual Assembly  of the Baha'is of Stuttgart and is responsible for the internal discipline of this group and for its nonpolitical character." Herr Goilmer showed him the political questionnaire he had previously filled out and was given about twelve blank forms for other members. He also showed Capt. Busey copies of National Assembly correspondence with Himmier concerning suspension of Baha'i activities. 

 NVe learned that announcements of meetings can be made without authorization. 

 Capt. Busey said that each Local Assembly could apply for authorization, and that later on the National Assembly could apply for authorization at USFET in Frankfurt. 

Eventually the American   

 National  Assembly can present the case of all the Baha'is in Germany and Austria before the Four 

Power Control Commission  

 in Berlin.  As we left, Capt. Busey told me to come to him whenever I needed help. 

 ttHC will send Hjs hosts from Heaven to help you, and nothing shall be impossible to you, if you have faith." —  — Baha'u'llah. 

 On August 29, 1945, Frau Doctor Adel-heid  Koller, Herr Paul Goilmer and I went to the office of the 6871st District Information 

Services Control Command  

 which controls  all publications and radio broadcasting in this area. I talked with the Chief of the Radio Section, Mr. William Burke Miller. I presented my Baha'i and Army credentials and the letter we secured from Military Government, and asked him about the policy governing radio programs. He said religious programs were given freedom as long as poi-itics  were not mixed in and there was no mention of the Germans being persecuted. He said that radio time for religious pro-grams.were allotted on a percentage plan and told us we might submit a program. Several have been prepared for consideration.


<p738>
738             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  A few minutes later we talked with Mr. Jean P. Best of the Intelligence Section of the same Command about permission for publication of a Baha'i pamphlet. 

 He said the Catholic and Protestant Churches had publishing houses of their own and that they publish literature and submit a copy of each publication to his office for approval before general distribution. He said the Baha'is could do the same. The proofs of the pamphlet  Die Baha'i Religion, a general introduction to the Faith, have already been corrected,  and we are having 5,000 printed, in keeping with the authorization of Mr. Felix Reichmann, 

Publications Control       
Officer of the CS7lsv      

DISCC.                     

 If you could have been there Sunday afternoon, August 26, 1945, you would have felt yourselves carried into the realms of another world. The 

Baha'is of Stuttgart       

 and Esslin-gen  gathered at "Baha'i Heim," the Summer School site, nestled in among the trees on a hill overlooking Esslingen and the verdant Neckar valley. My being privileged to attend  this wonderful gathering starts in the 100th 

Division Laboratory.       

 My coworker in the lab, Tec 5 Nelson H. Brown, who thinks some of the Baha'i principles are good, gave me the afternoon off duty. Frau Frida Bender and her daughter, Fraulein Helga Bender, and I left Bad Cann-statt  about 11:30 from Wilhelmsplaatz bound for Oberturkheim. Knowing you'll soon he visiting this school, I will mention that you take car No. 13 and transfer to No. 25. At the end of Line 25, you begin a delightful walk up the orchard and gar-den-covered bill which ushers you into Para-disc  Lane with the Summer School at the end. Hugo and Kiara Bender were awaiting us and served a delicious lunch for us and a group of about fifteen other Baha'i friends. The atmosphere was so uplifting that I f or-got  I was eating. 

 That our Division hovered around this area had something to do with divine intervention it seemed, not because of myself, but in order that some Baha'i cotild convey to these friends the greetings from the Baha'i world without, from which they have been deprived for about eight years — long, spiritually hungry, terror filled years. We were seated in the lecture hail for lunch. A picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha and quotations from his Writings hung from the walls. From there I went to an adjoining room to play the organ. How my heart warmed as the Baha children gathered around. 

 It seems almost unbelievable that out of all this destruction and disorder and chaos, that a cornerstone of the foundation of the World Civilization of Baha'u'llah has emerged well-anchored, that the fire and zeal of the believers has remained undimmed, and that their plans for the spreading of the Faith in the coming months will make the Baha'i world sit up and take notice. 

 As the afternoon wore on Baha'is came in droves from Stuttgart and Esslingen, of all ages, classes and temperaments, drawn by that irresistible Power of the Cause, that indescribable happiness that pervades every Baha'i meeting. How pleasant to wander from one little discussion group to another. Here is Dr. Koller, of the Stuttgart Local Assembly, a most active Baha'i; there stand Friedrich and Anna Marie Schweizer, two pillars of the Cause in past years; there is Paul Qollmer, the National 

Treasurer and Chairman     

 of the Stuttgart Local Assembly, who risked so much to preserve Baha'i archives;  his daughters, Agnes and Lilo (who lost her husband in the war) are nearby; not far away is Herr Richter of Leipzig who was on the Russian front, found his way to Denmark, was finally discharged near Frankfurt, and is now going from one town to the next looking for his wife and child. 

 I was impressed with the complete equality of the believers: this gentleman is still wearing the tattered remains of his German Army camouflage uniform, and there is a business man dressed as you find anywhere in America.  I was particularly drawn to the youth. 

 If the American believers could oniy be transported into this environment and realize the hardship and privation that these exemplary  souis have undergone and are still undergoing to a lesser degree, they would rise up as a powerful, spiritual radio and television transmitting station to proclaim with undaunted fervor the Message of the Lord of Hosts. Have we ever been seated in our homes reading our Baha'i books and had fear clutch at our hearts because we thought the shuffle of feet outside our apartment was some Gestapo Agent coming to check up on

  our activities? Did we ever have to hide our pictures of 'Abdu'l-Baha because we didn't want them confiscated or desecrated? 

 Some seventy believers were gathered in the garden (or the photograph. Several views were taken of the entire group and of ~he youth and children separately. 

 Then we went in the lecture hail. Hugo read a prayer, and 

Paul Golimer read a Tablet

 of 'Abdu'l-Baha  from Sonne der W/ahrheit (Sun of Truth). Then Paul discussed the importance of divorcing ourselves completely from antiquated  ecclesiastical organizations. He asked me to say a few words before the closing prayer. Very few are the times which have equalled the happiness I felt during that marvelous meeting. 

 On a three day pass, September 262 8, I was privileged to visit Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Heidelberg and Neckargemund. In Darm —  stadt, the birthplace of my paternal grandparents, I found Frau Marie Schenk, one of the accused in the public trial of Baha'is in Darmstadt in May 1944. 

 In Frankfurt I quickly made my way to the room of Sgt. Bruce Davison. 

 We talked at great length of past experiences in the Army and plans for assisting the believers in the reestablishment of the 

Cause in Germany. The     

 first evening we spent visiting a seeker, the second eve-fling  we spent in great happiness observing the Feast of Will at the Muller home, 41 Waidmannstrasse, Sachenhausen, Frankfurt. It was here for the first time that I met two outspoken and outstanding champions of the Faith, Dr. Hermann 

Grossmann and FraU-kin    

 Edith Horn. Our consultation centered around plans for a public meeting in Frankfurt.  On October 19, 1945, 250 people attended  the public meeting at 121 Gutleut Strasse. 

Introduced by Sergeant    

 Davison, Dr. Grossrnann spoke eloquently on "What 

Religious  Unity Can Bring

 to Mankind." It was most enjoyable to speak with Dr. Gross-mann,  an Argentine, in Spanish, about the progress of the Cause in Latin America. He was one of the group who started publication of the first German newspaper in Heidelberg, since the occupation of American troops. He has three books about the Cause in preparation, and has plans for the founding of a Baha'i Institute in Neckargemund, for the training of Baha'i teachers at the future 

Baha'i University in Esslingen.

 Of special inspiration was the wisdom and insight of Fraidein Edith Horn, revealed as she related the history of the Cause in Germany these last eight years. Others present at the Feast were Herr and Frau Muller and Frailleins Diesterweg and Kowaiski. On October 20, for the first time, a Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Frankfurt. 

 There are now thirteen believers in the city. 

 Time allowed oniy an hour for a delight-Lul  visit with Anna, Elsa Marie and Baha'i Grossmann and Lina Benke in Neckarge-mund. 

 Baha'i, whom I had met previ-ousiy  in Bad Cannstatt, has been active in spreading the Message among youth in her neighborhood. 

 They have all been outstanding defenders of the Cause during these perilous years. 

 At the present time we know of Baha'is in thirteen cities in Germany and Austria. To quote Dr. Grossmann, tCAn eventful chapter of the development of the Faith in this country has come to a close. 

 At the end of this record still stand the names of those who lost their lives on the battlefields, or by other war events, amongst them some of our most promising Baha'i youth. These are, as far as for the moment it can be recorded, their names: Jorg Brauns of 

KarL-ruhe,  Wilhelm Golimer
of Stuttgart, Hans-jorg   

Kohier of Stuttgart-Unterturkheirn, Fritz
Macco of Heidelberg and   

Alfred Schweizer of Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen.

 The fate of other young friends is still unknown. By other war events died Mrs. Else Gricke and her two little daughters, Margot and Rita, all from Leipzig. The fate of four Jewish believers of Frankfurt, i.e., Miss Sophie 

Rothschild from Weinheim  

 and the three 'Werthheimer sisters is still unknown. They were deported, as far as can be remembered, in November 1941, and it is to be supposed that they are no longer alive. Up to the last moment before their deportation,  friends of Frankfurt, Darmstadt and Neckargemund took care of them while in the Ghetto, at the risk of their lives, and Edith Horn was present at Miss Rothschild's in the very moment when Sophie and her neighbors were called for deportation. 

 CCM the sacrifices of their lives and the fact that none of the living believers — as far

 we all love more than our lives. Allih-u-AbhAI" The following is an account of the Anniversary  celebration of the Bab's Birthday, written by one of the members of the Baha'i Youth Group of Stuttgart, Fratilein

 Jeder-mann  war ergriffen als or von diesem reinen Leben des ersten Verkunders der BaM'i-Offenbarung horte. Es war, als sei der Geist Bab's leibhaftig unter uns. Wir alle fiihlten die grosse Aufgabe die wir Baha'is haben und jedes nahm sich sicherlich vor, das Leben Bab's sich zum Vorbild zn hehmen.

 In conclusion I must again express my extreme happiness for being privileged to contact our Baha'i brothers and sisters in Europe. My only sorrow is the parting with my Baha buddy, Cal, due to redeployment; and yet, I am happy for his family. As the war brought us together for a wonderful mission in Europe, so the peace is separating us for an even more supreme task of doing our part to inspire public acclaim for th~ Cause that can alone weld the shattered arms of humanity into one common brotherhood. 

 ttPut thy whole confidence in the grace of God, thy Lord. Let Him be thy trust in whatever thou doest, and be of them that have submitted themselves to His Will. 

 Let Him be thy helper and enrich thyself with His treasures, for with Him are the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth. He bestoweth them upon whom He will, and from whom He will He withholdeth them. There is none other God but Him the All-possessing, possessing, the AJ1-praised."-—  Baha'u'llah.

 La unidad del g6nero no podrA consiguirse sino cuando desaparezca en las diversas re-ligiones el preiuicio que tienen de poseer la verdad iinica y de considerar erradas las demis. Estas ideas unilaterales ban creado la intolerancia y, por ende, han ocasionado las guerras de religi6n, manteniendo hasta ahora separadas a ios hombres. 

 Cualesquiera que scan los nombres que se den a Dios, tsve no puede ser m6s que uno solo, porque es una sola la Fuerza que man-time  y dirige Ia armonia del Universo dentro de Ia variedad infinita de sus formas. Las religiones son los caminos de uni6n entre Dios y Ia humanidad, vienen de la misma Cima y van a la misma Lianura. 

 Entonces, no hay porqu6 Sc vean con recelo unas re-ligiones  con otras. 

 Lo que deben hacer es unirse par sus puntos de contacto par no empafiar ci brillo de La 6nica Luz que alumbra el mundo, del Linico Sol que sale de aqudlla Cima. 

 La armonia entre Ia religi6n y Ia ciencia, otra condici6n indispensable pan la unidad del g6nero humano. Mientras se crea que la ciencia — producto de Ia raz6n — es Ia tinica poseedora de Ia Verdad, la humanidad marchar~ siempre tambeleante, sin el apoyo del sentimiento, porque la Verdad no es patri —  monjo iinicamente de Ia inteligencia sino tambi6n del sentimiento, de esa fuerza in-terna,  poderosa y misteriosa que nos ensefia a creer, a arnar y perdonar y que se llama la

 Bien dice Ia religi6n Baha'i que no podemos volar hacia Dios con una sola ala. La re-ligi6n  y Ia ciencia son las dos alas imprescin-dibles  para

  ers of earth," wrote 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablet to the Central 

Organization for a Durable 

 Peace, the Hague, "cannot withstand  the privileges and bestowaL which God has ordained for this great and glorious century. 

 Peace is a need and exigency of the time. 

 Not always, during the past hundred years, has this truth carried the impact that it does today. 

 Its conception as a practical possibility  came to birth in the travail of the first World War; found tentative shape in the objectives and institutions of the Covenant  of the League of Nations; was tried, ignored, and betrayed through twenty years of checkered history; and culminated at last in a convulsion of unprecedented scope. 

 Yet, while the road travelled by humanity in these years seemed ever more remote from the concept of peace, growing in the hearts of men were a conviction and passion which are the true foundations of action. As World War II mounted to its climax, leaders and ordinary men alike began to gird themselves  for the greater struggle to come — the vast consuming effort for enduring peace. 

 It was in February, 1945, that the world first heard of the convening of the 

United Nations Conference  

 in San Francisco, scheduled to open on April 25th. 

 To the Baha'is of North America, mindful of the prophetic utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha while travelling through their countries, here was a thrilling fulfillment. 

 Words spoken in Sacramento, California, on October 26, 1912, came vividly  to mind: "The greatest need in the world today is International Peace. The time is ripe. 

 It is time for the abolition of warfare,  the unification of nations and governments. 

 Inasmuch as the Californians seem peace-loving and possessed of great worthiness and capacity, I hope that advocates  of peace may daily increase among them until the whole population shall stand for

  that beneficent outcome. 

 Then may altruistic  aims and thoughts radiate from this center toward all other regions of the earth and may the glory of this accomplishment forever halo the history of this country. May the first flag of International Peace be upraised  in this State." And again 'Abdu'l-Baha  had said: "May this American democracy be the first nation to establish the foundation of international agreement. 

 May it be the first nation to proclaim the universality of mankind. May it be the first to upraise the standard of the cMost 

Great Peace'               

 Conscious of this historic hour and of the import of such a Conference in the world's destinies, the Baha'is of Northern California were impelled to undertake united action to proclaim the program of their Faith for universal peace. In joint consultation, the Local Spiritual Assemblies of the Bay Area — Berke-Icy, Burlingame, Oakland, and San Francisco — drew up concrete recommendations for a teaching campaign more ambitious than any ever undertaken in the area. 

 These plans were presented to the National Spiritual Assembly,  and provided the basis for their action in appointing a national 

Committee on Baha'i Peace   

 Plan, "to promote the Baha'i Teachings in connection with the Allied Nations 

Conference."               

 The specific objectives assigned to this Committee embraced (1) radio broadcasts, (2) arrangement of a large public meeting, (3) the preparation of a special pamphlet presenting Baha'u'llah's plan for peace, (4) publicity, (5) displays showing the Baha'i Temple and literature, and (6) cooperation with local activities of the 

Bay Area Assemblies.      
    The National Spiritual     

 Assembly itself sent to the President of the 

United States, Franklin    

 Delano Roosevelt, prior to his death, a message of support in his historic efforts. 

 It is surely significant that, exactly thirty years earlier, on April 25, 1915, the first International Baha'i Congress, meeting in San Francisco under official auspices of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, had sent a similar message to President 'Wilson.' 

  'For copy of telegram to President Roosevelt, see Baha'i News, No. 174, page 13. The text of the telegram  to President Wilson was as follows: 

Moreover, that Congress    
had been honored by the    

Exposition Directorate     

 with the presentation of a commemorative medallion ~tin recognition of the Baha'i program for Universal 

Peace."                    

 San Francisco, "a place where hopes come true, where all purposes can be accomplished"!  Such were the words with which Secretary of State Stettinius opened the United Nations Conference, as followers of the Baha Faith in seventy-eight countries joined with all peace-loving peoples in the heartfelt hope that this Conference might inaugurate the age of close and continuing collaboration among the nations of the earth. 
                           
           II.                        

  April 25th was the momentous day, and all San Francisco was alive to the significance of the hour. Streets and restaurants overflowed with men of all nations. 

 On every hand they talked of the Conference, and of its opening in full plenary session that afternoon. 

 Scanning the faces of the delegates one wondered: Can they establish peace? 

 What magic touch have they to quiet the prejudices, the jealousies, and the divisive interests which characterize their nations and peoples? How will they learn to relate nation to nation, race to race, class to class? 

 How will they bind into one organic whole the multitudinous  fragments of humanity? 

 Truly, it was a great and solemn moment in the world's affairs, and none who attended the opening session, whether delegate or onlooker, could ever forget it. tQ•fj~~ deepest hope, the highest purpose of all mankind —  enduring peace — is here committed to our hands."

<p744>
744             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  The Conference strove for practical re-suits,  its purpose immensely fortified by the knowledge, gained at firsthand, of the terrible  interdependence of nations at war. Progress toward world collaboration had indubitably  been made since the days of the League Covenant, and the need of "Force as the servant of Justice" was to win concrete recognition in the provisions of the Charter. To be sure, the objectives of the Conference were strictly limited. To write the charter of international organization, and to hammer out the machinery through which the United Nations might, in the immediate future, ensure  their common security from aggression — this was the goal. Only gradually, in the years to come, the delegates agreed, would the larger vision of a truly united world be evolved. 

 Just two months were required by the Conference, working tirelessly and with spirit, to complete its task. 

 The machinery of world organization was designed and embodied  in a basic constitution for the guidance of all mankind. The scope of previous world institutions was widened and their powers enlarged. Now oniy the future would demonstrate the wisdom of world opinion in rejecting, at this juncture of events, a true concept of world federation. And only the future could test the workability of the new machine, so dependent, in the words of Field Marshal Smuts, upon CCthe human factor." 

 As the Conference came to a close, one could not but recall the words of Bab' —  u'1L&b, spanning the years with their challenge since the 1860's: "The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens. 

 The wellbeing of mgnkind, its peace and security are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established." 
                           
           III.                       

  It was the privilege of the Baha'is during this period, while extending every support to the efforts and goals of the Conference, to bring to the attention of delegates and public alike the unique claims of the 

Baha'i Faith.               

 Here was a Teaching which, for more than a century, had proclaimed the necessity of world organization, recognizing as the distinctive character of our age the complete interdependence of all nations and peoples. 

 Here was a vision which had fully anticipated the struggles of our time, seeing in them the death pangs of a hopelessly inadequate order, and the birth pangs of world civilization. 

 Here was a consistent policy to educate  humanity for its responsibilities of world citizenship, and, welcoming each advance in the development of world conscience and institutions, to infuse in the hearts of its supporters the conviction that no system less than genuine world commonwealth could provide adequate foundations for security and peace. Above all, here was a world community in action, nurtured by its dynamic belief in the oneness of mankind, aware that the root problem confronting society is the spiritual relationship which shall obtain between  men, and finding in its Founder, Baha'u'llah, the reappearance of that Word of God which can alone revitalize and adapt the eternal truths of religion to contemporary  life. 

 Such was the heritage and content of the Faith which Baha'is regarded as the "soic refuge of humanity in its hour of bitterest agony," and which they now arose to herald at this momentous climax of world history. 
                           
     RADIO ACTIVITIES           

  The unified teaching campaign, continu-ousiy  promoted by the Baha'is throughout the United Nations Conference, opened at 3:15 P.M. on April 21st with a halfhour radio broadcast on Station KQW, the San Francisco outlet for Columbia network. Difficulties in securing time had finally re-suited  in a well-nigh providential date and hour, the very anniversary of 

Baha'u'llah's Declaration   

 of His mission, which is celebrated  annually throughout the Baha'i world. The program was also propitiously placed for the opening of the 

Conference.                
  "World Order Is the Goal"  

 became a theme widely associated with the principles of the Faith, through this program, the statewide publicity accompanying it, and its subsequent rebroadcast throughout the United States and Canada. 

 Principal speakers  were the Honorable Robert W. 

Kenny, Attorney General    

 of California and technical adviser to the American delegation at the United Nations Conference; and Arthur L. Dahi, Jr., vice-chairman of the Committee

  on Jlah&'i Peace Plan. 

 An international cast of nine others took part, including the mistress of ceremonies, Miss Shirley Warde, and representatives of China, Persia, Europe, and America — all Baha'is except one. 

 With dramatic effect the hopes of all sections of humanity were voiced for the outcome  of the Conference, and excerpts from the prophetic utterances of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha were given. Attorney General Kenny made eloquent appeal to the United Nations to achieve their supreme objective, the creation of a t~structure of peace," and to America to assume that leadership for which she had been historically prepared. Mr. Dahi then projected with masterly logic and detail the Baha'i plan for peace. ttThe inspiring assurance the Baha'is would offer," he said, "is that there exists in the world today both a plan for a comprehensive cooperative  society on a worldwide scale and the spiritual dynamic capable of putting it into operation. 

 If mankind will harness its efforts to the great spiritual force now at work throughout the world, then a true world society will surely evolve A glimpse of the world of tomorrow was swiftly etched through readings from Shoghi Effendi's memorable paragraphs on world commonwealth. 

 "It is towards this goal," concluded Miss Warde, "the goal of a New World Order, that humanity must strive. God grant that the step we take in San Francisco may set us firmly on the patlil" As indicated, this broadcast was the occasion  of a widespread campaign. 

 Through cooperation with the Regional Teaching Committee all Baha'i communities and individuals  in California were urged to bring the program to the attention of friends and public, and a uniform news release and advertisement  were suggested. As a result outstanding  publicity was achieved in over twenty California cities and towns. In the Bay Area 3,000 announcements were mailed and daily, neighborhood, legal, and Negro newspapers granted excellent notice. 

 The program was rebroadcast in San Francisco on Station KYA on May 2nd, the last day of Ridvan (the celebration of Baha'u'llah's Declaration), heralded by spot announcements on the radio for two days. Record-irigs  of the original broadcast were also made by cooperation with the National Radio Committee, and orders for use in rebroadcasting  were filled from forty-two cities throughout the United States and Canada, to whom the publicity material was also provided. 

 Phonograph recordings were circulated  to groups by the local Regional Committee,  and provided for the Guardian of the Faith and the National Spiritual 

Assembly.                  

 Although radio results are usually in. tangible, reports from several cities showed that the program had won professional approbation  and had aroused considerable public interest. 

 Certainly, it constituted one of the most important elements of the Peace Plan campaign. 

 The radio work was supplemented and strengthened by the San Francisco Spiritual Assembly, which devoted thirteen weeks on its CBahA~i World Order Program" to a series of talks, interviews, and round tables on the theme: 

"Foundations of Universal  

 Peace." This was a fifteen-minute weekly broadcast on Station KYA, Sundays, 6:30 P.M., March 11-May 27, inclusive. 

 The series opened with three introductory talks, each presenting in broad outline the Baha'i Peace Program. 

 The principles underlying both war and peace were analyzed in the next three programs, as described by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablet to the Hague. in the remaining weeks, the stages in the evolution of society toward the Most Great Peace were delineated, as outlined  by Shoghi Effendi in the closing pages of The Promised Day Is Come.2 The series, which drew on an already-established listening  audience, carried as part of its weekly announcement the historic utterance of 'Abdu'l-Baha at Sacramento (quoted above), and His words also reached some 2500 perSons  to whom announcements were sent. 

 A few months later this series was repeated in Southern California by the Spiritual Assembly  of the Baha'is of Los Angeles. Thus did the Baha'is contribute their full weight 2 Weekly titles of radio series were: Preparing for a PostWar World;

     PUBLIC MEETINGS           

  The second phase of this sustained teaching  campaign was conducted two weeks after the Conference opening. 

 It was focused around a public Symposium, presented (in the words of the program) t~as a tribute to the purposes of the United Nations Conference  for International Organization, and with the hope that the principles of the Baha'i Faith may add their contribution to this momentous endeavor in the cause of universal peace." 

 The theme of this meeting, which was held on the evening of May 9th in the Scottish  Rite Auditorium, San Francisco, was again "'World Order Is the Goal." Speakers were Mr. Leroy Toas, member of the National  Spiritual Assembly of the Ba1A'is of the U. S. and Canada, and Chairman of the National 

Teaching Committee; Rudolf

 Hol-sti,  Ph.D., former Minister of Foreign Affairs of 

Finland, former Permanent 

 Delegate to the League of Nations, and Acting 

Professor of Political    
Science, Stanford University;

 and Mrs. Dorothy Baker, member of the National Spiritual 

Assembly and Chairman     

 of the Inter-America Committee; with Miss Marion Holley, Chairman of the San Francisco Spiritual  Assembly, as chairman. 

 The meeting was immediately preceded by a banquet of fifty at the Palace Hotel, arranged  on behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly, with the really remarkable interest and help of Dr. HoistS. An esteemed statesman and champion of the League of Nations, Dr. Hoisti had attended every Assembly of the League trom 1922 to the last gathering in 1939, as delegate for Finland, winning the friendship of the leaders of many nations. 

 While realizing the extreme pressure of their Conference duties, it was yet Dr. Hot-sti's  wish to invite to the banquet these colleagues,  to whom he planned to pay especial tribute in his Symposium address. 

 Invitations,  with enclosed programs, were therefore extended to twenty-four Conference delegates  of thirteen countries,3 including nine The thirteen countries: Belgium, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, 

South Africa, United      
Kingdom, Venezuela.       

 who headed their respective delegations, and the following found it possible to attend as official representatives and guests of honor: 

  His Excellency Francisco  

 Castillo N~jera, delegate for Mexico and Ambassador to the United States. 

 His Excellency Ivan Kerno, delegate for Czechoslovakia, Envoy Extraordinary and 

Minister Plenipotentiary. 

 Dr. Li Shu-Ean, Adviser to Chinese delegation, and adviser to Chinese 

Supply Commission.        
  Dr. Carlos Rodriguez Jiminez,

Secretary to Venezuelan   
delegation, and Consul General.

 M.  Alphonse Als, Adviser to Luxembourg delegation, and Chief of Cabinet, 

Ministry  of Foreign Affairs.

  Most courteous replies were received from the others to whom, at a later date, the Committee was able to forward on behalf of the National 

Spiritual Assembly a      

 copy of the pamphlet, The Baha'i Peace Program, which was presented as a memento to the banquet guests. 

 Beside the official delegates, there were twenty-six other guests, for the most part distinguished friends of Dr. HoLd, including  several college professors, most of whom had never attended any previous Baha meeting.  The banquet was a feast indeed, rich in that spirit of warmth and vitality which the Faith engenders. 

 The guests of honor from Mexico, Czechoslovakia, and Venezuela, as well as the Consul for Iceland, Mr. Thorlacksen, were also able to participate in the Symposium which followed,  and their informal public statements were remarkable both for their cordial appreciation and comprehension of 

Baha'i principles. Meeting

 but a few days after the victory in Europe, all in that audience (esti-mated  at 600 to 700) were vividly aware of the sobering responsibility, which con —  fronted not alone the Conference but the whole of mankind, to bring to a successful conclusion the vast struggle in which the world was and is still engaged, to achieve the basis of secure and lasting peace. ttLet us devote all our energies," was Dr. Hoisti's plea, c!1~ the final attainment of a permanent  peace in everlasting honor of the Great


<p748>
748            THE BAHA'I WORLD

  Architect of the universe Who unites all the races, all the religions, in mutual iove and construction instead of mutual struggle and destruction."4 To this call the Baha'i speakers added with brilliant clarity the message  of the Baha'i Faith, thus concluding a memorable program whose fame, it has been learned, reached even to Egyptian readers in an Arabic account of Baha'i activities at San 

Francisco!                

 The success of the banquet and Symposium grew from the sustained efforts of all the Baha'is in the Bay area, and was reinforced by other phases of the Peace Plan campaign, details of which are given elsewhere in this report. Suffice it to say that major publicity was obtained just prior to the meeting; spot announcements by radio were made and the May 2nd broadcast was coordinated; effective  exhibits of the Temple model, literature, and spread of the Faith were arranged for the meeting; and 350 advance copies of the special pamphlet were distributed to the audience and banquet guests. Some 3500 invitations were also mailed. 

 Yet another activity was Mrs. Baker's teaching during the five days she remained in San Francisco. 

 Eight other talks were given, including a tea at the San Francisco Women s City Club for about seventy-five guests, student groups at the University of California  and Stanford University, the entire student body of Montezuma School for Boys, later the entire faculty of Montezuma, a fine public meeting for Burlingame, and two additional  public meetings in San Francisco. Mrs. Baker poured out her strength and spirit without ceasing, and the enthusiasm and interest engendered were marked. 

 Thus the Symposium provided an opportunity  for widespread notice of the social and spiritual principles of the Baha'i Faith and their close relation to the purposes of the Conference. In the words of Dr. Albert Guerard, professor of French at Stanford University and noted writer on world affairs: "Especially at the present moment, we cannot  forget that the Baha have always stood for the cause which is triumphing at last." 

  This was perhaps Dr. Hoisti's last public statement, as he died unexpectedly a few months later, in August, 1945. 

      PEACE PAMPHLET            

  Perhaps the most far-reaching project undertaken by the Peace Plan Committee was the preparation, publication, and distribution  of a special pamphlet entitled 

The Baha'i Peace Program. 

 No effort was spared on this document, either as to content or format, for it was recognized that the Conference  provided "an ideal opportunity to expound the Baha'i peace teachings, and bring to the attention of the delegates as well as the general public the spiritual element  and larger implications of the World Order of 

Baha'u'llah."              

 Three sections, composed of introductory statements and excerpts from Baha'i writings,  presented the Faith's concrete proposals for world organization ("The Federation of Mankind"), delineated the pivotal principle of the oneness of mankind ("The Guiding Principle of World Order"), and projected Baha'u'llah's challenging claim that nothing save the power of the Word of God could unite and inspire humanity for its crucial tasks 

("The Renewal of Faith"). 

 Prefaced by a tribute to the purposes of the Conference, whose relation to the prophetic  statements of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha was also clearly shown, the pamphlet effectively demonstrated the priority, insight,  and far-reaching scope of the Baha'i Program for universal peace. 

 The booklet was published in 11,500 copies,  and in the third week of May some 2,000 were mailed to all those connected with the Conference (delegates, advisers, consultants, secretariats, press, and radio), 1,800 being sent to leading citizens in the area. 
In addition,  the Los    

Angeles Spiritual Assembly

 distributed  1,000 copies, over 400 were utilized for the Symposium and banquet, the Assemblies  and Regional 

Committee in California  

 made use of hundreds more, and a small supply was made available to Baha'i communities throughout the U. S. and Canada. 

 (Another edition of 20,000 was subsequently  ordered by the National Assembly.) 

 Evidence of the interest aroused among delegates reached the Committee in various ways. The Baha'i News Service contributed a typical comment: "From very reliable non-BaM'i source~ in Chicago, I learn that the


<p749>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS               749

  Faith is being discussed with considerable interest among the delegates." 

 A similar expression  was heard from journalists in Chicago  who were deeply "impressed by the Baha'i teachings while in San 

Francisco.~~               
                           
         PUBLICITY                  

  As noted above, the radio broadcast and Symposium provided focal opportunities for newspaper publicity, and the record for California (not including radio publicity in other sections of the continent) showed 69 items of Baha'i publicity on the Conference campaign, appearing in 36 newspapers of 26 cities and towns. 

 In San Francisco alone, notice was obtained in S newspapers, including  4 leading dailies, and legal, commercial, Negro, and neighborhood journals; while items appearing in nearby cities were also remarkably good. 

 Two special publicity projects were undertaken,  namely, the publication of display advertisements  (2 columns by 10 inches) in leading San Francisco dailies, outlining basic Baha'i principles for peace. The first, entitled  "The Baha'i Peace Program" and embodying ten "basic principles of world reconstruction," appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle and Sdn Francisco News on May 6th (Sunday) and 7th, respectively. 1t was substantially copied on May 9th by the News in an interview with Mrs. Baker, four columns  wide with photograph, headlined ttBah&'i 

Offers Ten-Point Plan."    

 The second display advertisement, published on June 23rd and 25th, in the San Francisco Examiner,  News, and Chronicle, featured ttBah4'i Contributions to World Peace," some ~ essential to world unity of conscience. 

 Obtaining the newspaper space at such a time was truly providential, particularly as the first display appeared just before VE-Day (victory in Europe), while the second was associated with the closing of the Conference and the visit of President 

Truman to San Francisco.   

 In an article summarizing the "Baha'i campaign of public information" during the Conference, the San Francisco Examiner included the following report: "Publicity in the daily papers told tens of thousands of readers how Baha'i teachings provide the spiritual and moral motivation which will make the peace machinery function." 
                           
   DISPLAYS AND EXHIBITS      

  Displays of Baha'i material were another effective method of keeping alive in public consciousness the Peace Program of the Baha'i Faith. During this period five displays  were arranged. 

 The most important was a three-weeks' exhibit, beginning June 4th, in the window of the main office of the American Express Company in the heart of San Francisco's shopping district. Here a striking model of the Baha'i Temple was flanked by detailed photographs of the Temple, Baha'i literature in English and foreign languages, and copies of the peace pamphlet. 

 According to an official of the Express Company, ttwe are glad to have had this display, because many people have shown interest and have stopped in asking questions  and also for booklets." 

 Other exhibits of Temple photographs and Baha'i literature were displayed at the Yazdi Shop in Berkeley, the Ross Radio Shop in San Matco, and the A. C. Toas Printing Co. in San Francisco. 

 As mentioned previously, special exhibits were held at the Symposium, including the Temple model, Baha'i literature,  and an interesting display of maps and placards showing the countries, races, and languages embraced by the Faith. 
                           
     OTHER ACTIVITIES           

  As a national organization, the Faith was accorded official observer status at the Conference,  and was enabled to display the peace pamphlet at the Conference headquarters for observers. Baha'i World also had an observer present and another believer represented the Carnegie Foundation. 

 Thus plenary sessions, commission meetings, and special meetings arranged by the State Department  were attended by these observers, as well as several other Baha'is, resulting in countless stimulating contacts and opportunities  which far exceed the compass of this summary. It is interesting to note that var-jous  Baha'is, through their professional activities,  were brought into close relation to the Conference and some of its leading per. sonalities. 

 Further, as a result of contact with the

As chairman of the Conference Committee on the Economic and Social Coun-cii,  characterized by delegates as the c%eart of the Charter," he commanded universal respect and the active admiration of Baha'is, who recognized in the spirit and goals of the Council a kindred concern for the unity and wellbeing of the whole of mankind.

 ~     rejoice in the success of the high endeavors of the Peace Committee in San Francisco," cabled Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Faith, on July 1, 1945, thus closing a brief but dynamic chapter in the onmarch of the Baha world community. None who participated in the campaign could fail to share in some measure the sense of achievement,  particularly the Baha'is of Northern California who had risen with unanimity, energy, and material support to discharge their significant responsibilities. 

 It is far too soon to evaluate the permanent contributions to world peace of the United Nations 

Conference at San Francisco. 

 Nor does humanity, on the other hand, yet pretend to measure or appreciate the validity of the Divine Program enunciated by Baha'u'llah. 

 Yet 1945 will certainly be remembered  as a crucial year in the destinies of nations — a year to end wars and one, we dare to hope, which saw the raising of "the first flag of 

International Peace."     

 As the future moves swiftly to its cuLmination,  may the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha written in 1919, through the aid of all men of good will, be brought to complete fruition.  "Justice and Right shall be fortified, but the establishment of Universal Peace will be realized fully through the power of the Word of God."5 The following item appeared

           RELIGION COMES AGAIN TO MANKIND

 Address delivered May 22, 1944, on the program of the Baha'i Centenary, May 1923, 1944. 

                  B~ DOROTHY BAKER

  RELIGION is progressive, rushing forward  like a giant river from God to the ages, watering the arid centuries to produce flowering civilizations and holy lives. 

 There has never been a prophet of a religion who has not been doubted. 

 Through under-emphasis they have become dim historic figures who can be judged oniy by the results apparent in the world after them. 

 In the light of the Baha'i Faith, the shadowy forms of the world's great Master Teachers stand out again in brilliant relief against the mediocrity of their times. Their wisdom is deathless. They stand alone against the world, arch-types, on a mount of vision, foreshadowing the perfections of an unfolding  race. Baha'u'llah aptly calls them Manifestations of God. As heat manifests fire, as a ray manifests the sun, these pure and stainless souls manifest the 'Will of God whose plan for spiritual evolution is written, chapter by chapter, in their lives and utterances.  They are despised, mocked, imprisoned, crucified, but out of the crucible of their suffering; religion is born again; they are proofs of the power of God. 

 Abraham, son of a pagan priest in Ur, was exiled because He taught the oneness of God. He came over into the region of the holy land, a man alone against the world. By the power of religion, His exile became glorious, His descendants produced the prophets of Israel, and most of Europe and Asia came under the influence of the God of Israel. 

 At a later period Moses appeared, a man who was a stammerer, who had been brought up in the house of Pharaoh, who was known among men as a murderer, who through fear had for a long time remained in concealment,  shepherding the flocks of Jethro. Moses, standing one day on Mt. Horeb, heard the voice of God, directing him to free the Jewish nation. 

 What could a stammerer reply? Would be be convincing, even to his own people? 
How could he command a Pharaoh?

 t~Oh my Lord, I am not eloquent," He lamented, "but I am siow of speech and of a slow tongue." 

 And the Lord said, "Who hath made man's mouth? I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what to say." 

 After this Moses went into the market places of the Egyptians, teaching the 

Children  of Israel. The  

 Word of God was upon Him and He was no longer afraid of any The people listened. At times when Pharaoh's lash descended more brutafly they turned from Moses, for how could they believe in a single man, alone against the world, against Pharaoh's chariots, against starvation and cruelty and poverty? 

 how could they know that Moses, whose staff was His only companion, would lead the Jews, six hundred thousand strong, into the wilderness and the promised land? 

 By the power of religion Moses fed, housed, and taught the people, p~urified their lives, gave them back their faith, brought them under His civilizing law, and bestowed  upon them knowledge and love of God. 

 Moreover, He set in motion a great civilization for those times. The children of Israel became the envy of the pagans. The civilization of the Pharaohs went down to utter loss. Literacy, government, and moral values continued for many centuries to make Jerusalem, the city of the Jews, the cultural center of the ancient world. To such a development  did they attain that the sages of Greece came to regard the illustrious men of Israel as models of perfection. 

 An exam-pie  is Socrates, who visited Syria and took from the children of Israel the teachings of the unity of God and of the immortality of the soul. A man found his highest tribute

  iii     the words, "Ide is like the Jews." Such is the power of religion. 

 Revelation is progressive, sweeping onward  with the natural evolution of the race. Jesus Christ appeared, the living Word of God, flashing like a giant meteor through the musty period of decline that marked His generation. 

 Born of Mary, nurtured in the Jewish church, assisted neither by His own people, nor by the military powers of Rome, nor by the intellectual supremacy of the Greeks, Jesus of Nazareth brought into being, in a mere three year span of ministry, a Faith destined to cross seas and continents and enter at last every known country on the planet. Today hospitals, cathedrals, universities, and governments testify to the power of religion through Jesus Christ. 

 Alone against the world, healing, blessing on the one hand, hurling fierce accusations into the very teeth of a hypocritical and dormant society on the other, Jesus became the primal point of a vast civilization. So great was His power, born of 

God, that Baha'u'llah      

 in recent times wrote of it: "The deepest wisdom which the sages have uttered, the profoundest learning which any mind hath unfolded, the arts which the ablest hands have produced, the influence exerted by the most potent of rulers, are but mani —  festations of the quickening power released by His transcendent, His all-pervasive, and resplendent Spirit. He it is who purified the world." 
    His was a strange sovereignty.

 The stars were His lamps; He had no place to lay His head. Yet His was the sovereignty that could scourge the money changers! His was the power to say, "Pick up thy bed and walk!" His was the power to utter the divine words, "Thy sins are forgiven thee; go and sin no more!" All power in heaven and earth was given to Him, the humble carpenter. God does not prove His power by exalting the already exalted. 

 From the upper chambers of communion with this Immortal Beauty, a handful of lowly fishermen conquered the world. 

 Such is the power of religion. 

 IslAm leaves no less a proof. The Arabic civilization in the sixth century was sunken into degeneracy. 

 Drunkenness and moral profligacy abounded. Mecca, center of worship  for the pagans, boasted no less than three

  hundred fifty idols, including effigies of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Mul?ammad denounced the idols, preached against the practices of the people, and declared the singleness of Gad. 

 Mubamniad never fought against the Christians; on the contrary, He treated them kindly and gave them perfect freedom. A community of Christian people lived at NaI-ran  who were under His care and protection. Muhammad said, "If anyone infringes their right, I myself will be his enemy, and in the presence of God I will bring a charge against him.~~ How appalling were the misfortunes that befell Muliammad! Alone against the world He preached the truth, and all the powers of Arabia leagued themselves against Him. That He dared to bless a girl child was pretext enough for stoning Muliammad. When He prayed much in the desert alone, the people flung refuse at His holy person. 

 A thousand injuries He sustained in meekness, a man alone against the world. It is written, too, that girl children were buried alive, and that Persian and Indian maidens were brought for licentious entertainment during the Meccan  months of worship. 

 The scene changes. We find the Arabians emerging to scientific and moral heights under the refining laws of Mulammad. Gambling and drunkenness disappeared. 

 The protection of women was established. The arts flourished, the mathematics, astronomy, and literature of Cordova and Salamanca became  world-famous. Moral life was purified. Political unity from Arabia to Spain drew tribal life upward to national sovereignty. In short, from the lowest human condition, the people of IsHm formed for a time the most powerful center of izivilization. Such is the power of religion. 

 But all religion moves in seasons. The nineteenth century portrays a winter. 

 Gone is the fervor of the apostle; gone the fire of earlier faith. Decay, intrigue, and division had swept away the very foundations of IsUm; division and lassitude had eaten into the fibre of Christendom; Judaism, a thing hunted, no longer presented a strong or united front. 

 Into such a world came Baha'u'llah, preceded by His youthful forerunner, the Mb. 

 It was one hundred years ago, on May 22, 1844, unheralded by the world's leaders, that the Baha'i Faith was born. The B&b received on that day His first disciple, and announced to him the dawn of a new religious cycle. The scene of the announcement was a humble dwelling in ~hirAz, Persia. 

 The Bab Himself was a radiant young Persian of some two and twenty years. He was a merchant by profession, practicing a trade, as had the Carpenter of Nazareth, two millenniums before Him. On that eventful day He went, a little before sundown, to the gate of the city. His tranquil beauty must have arrested even the heedless, as He stood scanning the faces of the passing multitudes. 

 Among those in the vicinity of the gate that day was a Sliaykhi student, a young man of great inner-perception, whose own heart promptings had irresistibly drawn him to Shir~z, in search of a great Master. ~Lusayn, like the Magi of old, knew that a time pregnant with divine power was again at hand. With what sudden inrush of joy he must have gazed for the first time upon the countenance of the B&b. Still uninformed, however, of the reason for his ecstasy, he accompanied His lordly host to the modest dwelling chosen to become the scene of the proclamation. An Ethiopian servant opened the door, and the gentle voice of the DAb addressed His youthful visitor saying, "Enter therein, in peace, secure." 

 On that night the B~b announced to ~Iusayn His own mission and likewise the coming of a mighty prophet, "Him whom God would make manifest," whose coming would introduce the foretold age of unity and peace. 

 Except for the fragmentary reports of ~usayn, the first disciple, little is known of the hours that flew in quick succession from sundown to dawn in the upper room of that house. 

 The apostle is one of the mysteries  of every religion. He attains the miracle  of faith a little before his world, unable to see the end from the beginning, yet melting,  flame-like into the heart of the Revelator.  The commentaries that fell from the lips and pen of the Mb filled His listener with extreme inner excitement. "All the delights"  records ~{usayn, "all the ineffable glories, which the Almighty has recounted in His Book, as the priceless possessions of

  the people of Paradise — these I seemed to be experiencing that night." 

 The holy and transforming power of the BTh is the first proof of our time that religion has come again to mankind. Through the pen of a chronicler we walk with Him on the lonely road to ~hir&z, whence he has come to meet the armed guards who have been sent to seize Him; we hear the pleading of the captain of the guard that He escape to a place of safety lest He be delivered to His death; we listen to His soft-spoken reply, "May the Lord, your God, requite you for your magnanimity and noble intention. 

 No one knows the mystery of My Cause; no one can fathom its secret. Until My last hour is at hand none dare assail Me; none can frustrate the plan of the Almighty." 

 We follow His path of exile as far as the city of Tabriz; a thousand excited citizens come out to meet Him. They kiss the stirrups  that His feet have touched, and offer their children to be healed. His mercy is like the mercy of Christ; it is given freely, with no hope of reward. 

 We further watch through tile eyes of chroniclers the long months spent in the prison fortress of MTh.-K~, situated in the northern mountains. 

 The rough tribesmen crowding at the gates are Kurds, wildest natives of Persia, and bitter traditional enemies  of the people of the Mb. They listen to His chanted prayer; they learn to take their oaths in the name of the holy One within the walls of the prison; they yearn to attain His presence; their lives struggle upward. 

 A glimpse of His martyrdom is witness to the power of God. A Christian general whispers a plea for forgiveness. 

 ~!Enab1e me to free myself from the obligation to shed your blood," he entreats his noble prisoner. CCFo11OW your instructions," the B~b replies, "and if your intention be sincere, the Almighty  is surely able to relieve you from your perplexity." The Mb is suspended on ropes, to be shot. Seven hundred and fifty men, led by 

SAm KMn, the Christian     

 genera',  fire a volley of shots. The cords are severed by the shots but the Bab remains untouched. 

 The soldiers of Kh&n flee in terror and Kh&n thankfully retires from his ignoble task. Strangers are brought to commit the odious deed, and the spirit of the BTh takes its flight. It is high noon. A dust storm from that hour to the going down of the sun causes fright among the ten thousand witnesses of the scene. The effect of the martyrdom of the Bab is far-reaching. 

 The merciless opposers of His truth, like the opposers of old are swept into the limbo of the forgotten, while out of the life of the martyr-revelator moves the age-old, twofold process of the fall of an old order of things, and the rise of a believing people. 

 More than twenty thousand preceded the B~b to a martyr's grave; a bare handful survived Him. 

 Among the few was Baha'u'llah, son of a Persian Vazir of high station and reputation. 

    As a child, Baha'u'llah    

 showed remarkable capacities, coupled with innate wisdom. 

 The wisest men of the realm came to regard His destiny as distinct from others. When He was still quite young his father dreamed that he saw his son swimming in a limitless and shining sea. Innumerable fish clung to the hairs of His head as He swam, and the light of the sea was derived from His presence in the water. 

 The Vazir, greatly impressed by the dream, summoned a wise and venerable man of that region, who gazed intently upon Baha'u'llah and extolled the beauty of His youthful countenance. 

 "The limitless ocean, Oh Vazir," he said, Ctj~ none other than the world of being. Singlehanded and alone, your son will achieve supreme ascendancy over it. The multitude of fishes signifies the turmoil which He will arouse amidst the kindreds and peopies of the earth. 

 Around Him will they gather, and to Him will they cling." 

 By reason of this and other incidents the Vazir soon came to realize the concealed glory of his noble son. Like Jacob, he desired only the welfare of his beloved Joseph. 

 At a later time Baha'u'llah, grown to manhood,  was offered important positions of state which He steadfastly refused. "All that we can hope to achieve," explained one dignitary of the nation to his own son, ~ but a fleeting  and precarious allegiance which will vanish  as soon as our days are ended. Our mortal life can never be free from the vicissitudes that beset the path of earthly ambition. Even those who, while we are still living honor us with their lips would, in their hearts, condemn  and vilify us were we, for but one

  moment, to fail to promote their interests. Not so, however, with Baha'u'llah. 

 Unlike the great ones of the earth, whatever be their race or rank, He is the object of a love and devotion such as time cannot dim nor enemy destroy. His sovereignty the shadows of death can never obscure nor the tongue of the slanderer undermine. Such is the sway of His influence that no one among His lovers dare, in the stillness of night, evoke the memory of the faintest desire that could, even remotely, be construed as contrary to His wish. Such lovers will greatly increase in number. The love they bear Him will never grow less, and will be transmitted from generation  to generation until the world shall have been suffused with its glory." 

 Baha'u'llah spread far and wide the teachings of the Bib and for a time wisely withheld His own identity as the One foretold. In 1852, fdllowing the martyrdom of the great forerunner and prophet, Baha'u'llah Himself was seized and imprisoned as a Bab in the underground dungeon of Tihr~n. En route to this loathsome pit, He was stoned and derided by a populace incited by His enemies to acts of violence. An aged woman ~egged to be permitted to cast her stone. "Suffer the woman," said the holy prisoner. 

  tCDeny her not what she regards as a mentor-ious act in the sight of God." 

 With such calm resignation Baha'u'llah took up His toll of sacrifice for a Cause in which the Bib was the dawn and He the noonday sun. With a few companions He was placed in the dungeon in stocks. His words of endearment continued day by day to cheer their hearts, and no day passed without  singing. "God is sufficient unto me," ran their glad refrain, "He verily is the all-suffic-ing. 

 In Him let the trusting trust." 

 In later years Baha'u'llah, with His fain-ily  and over seventy followers was exiled to 'AkM, Palestine, a fortress city situated at the foot of historic Mt. Carmel. Here, in barrack rooms, the little band of first believers  lived in such ~oy as to make them a source of wonder to all, in these days Baha'u'llah  wrote to friends, (CF not. These doors shall be opened. My tent shall be pitched on Mt. Carmel, and the utmost joy shall be realized." 
  This indeed was the case.  

 His last years were passed at Baha, on the plains outside of the city. Here He wrote and taught, and often in the summer, the cypress trees of Carmel offered shade to the world's greatest prisoner. 

 This was a fitting fulfillment of the pens of Judaism, Christendom, and Is-Thin, which had so often extolled Mt. Carmel. Here the Christian world was wont to look for the return of the Spirit, 

Christ.                    

 Here He wrote many of the Tablets to the kings, begun earlier in the exile, enjoining upon them the peace of the world and advising  them of the ways to attain it. Here, in a land where women were often little more than chattel, He taught the equality of men and women, Here, in a world removed from science, He proclaimed the harmony of science and true religion. 

 Here, in a despotic monarchy, He espoused the cause of representative  government, world language, a world tribunal, and federation of the nations. Here, in the midst of fanaticism and bigotry He proclaimed, "Consort with the people of all religions with joy and fragrance." 

 Baha'u'llah counted all of the revealed religions as one and the same. 

 "I have been preceded in this matter," He wrote, 

CCby Muhammad,  the Apostle

 of God, and before Him by the Spirit, Christ, and before Him by the Interlocutor, Moses." 

 Recognizing the differences of emphasis from time to time in God's revealed religion, He said, ttffi every Dispensation the light of divine guidance has been focussed upon one central theme. 

 In this wondrous Revelation, this glorious century, the foundation of the Faith of God and the distinguishing feature of His law is the consciousness of the oneness of mankind." 

 From the days of the exile forward, the little band of believers throughout the world have counted the promulgation of this principle to be their foremost obligation. 

 The final propf of a religion is its survival and its triumph over hardship. 

 Were the walls of 'Akka to obscure forever the hallowed  light of Baha'u'llah Could such a community outlive its founders? 

 The answer heartening. Today the Baha'i Faith has encircled the earth. In a single century it has entered more than sixty countries, has numbered within its ranks no less than thirty races; its adherents represent all of the re

ARTiCLES AND REVIEWS               757

  ligions, all of the classes, all of the cultures of the world; its writings are published in over forty languages. It has swept from the dungeon to the palace, from the humble Merchant of ShirAz to royalty, from a handful of Shaykhi students to scholars and statesmen, from the upper room in Shir&z to far-flung outposts and to the most highly civilized cities of the modern world. Its lovers have left hearth and home in unpaid missionary efforts to spread its tenets and offer its comfort to all countries. With flame-like devotion its teachers have followed in the footsteps of its martyrs, who, without reward gave up their lives to establish for all time a spiritual world commonwealth committed to unity in the love of God. 

 The walls of the prison city closed around Baha'u'llah in 1868. At the time of the rise of the Young Turks in 1908, they opened to His son, 'Abdu'l-Baha, who subsequently journeyed to England, France, Germany, and the United States. 

 The days of this noble successor among the western friends were marked by striking victories, for churches, synagogues, and peace societies opened their doors to him. 'Abdu'l-Baha gave to the '~'est two profound gifts; a social message of complete  unity and an infant community whose collective life could demonstrate it. In his Will and Testament 'Abdu'l-Baha appointed his eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as interpreter and first Guardian of the Faith. 

 Today the Faith of the Rib and Baha'u'llah  has moved out of its primitive or apostolic period into a formative era. Haifa, now a flourishing seaport across the bay from 'Akka, is the chosen residence of Shoghi Ef —  fendi, whose World Order Letters have already  made an indelible impression upon the stream of international life. 

 Baha, with its gardens and the tomb of Baha'u'llah, has become a place of world pilgrimage. Mt. Carmel, whose cypress trees once sheltered the holy prisoner, now boasts the terraced shrines of His family. On its ninth terrace a Temple is destined to be reared, and from its peak the future Baha'i Universal House of Justice will overlook the Mediterranean, a House dedicated to the service of a corn.-munity whose pattern is "inclined neither to East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor poor, neither white nor colored." "Its watchword is the unification of the human race; its standard the ~Most Great Peace.' 

 The holy land of Abraham, of Moses, and Jesus, is again glorious with religious aspiration.  The time-honored door of Revelation opens again before us as we listen with the first disciple to the fragrant welcome of the BTh: (cEt therein in peace, secure.

              THE ONENESS OF HUMANITY
Address delivered on tbe program of the Baha'i Centenary, May 192 5, 1944.

 has been raised; regard ye not one another as stran gers.    Of one tree are all ye the fruit and of one bough the leaves.          The world is but one country and mankind its citizens." So wrote Baha'u'llah seventy years ago, at a time when the masses of the world's peoples were concerned with local problems, local needs, and local aspirations. 

 And Baha'u'llah wrote this at a time when the leaders of the world's peoples were giving no heed to questions  of world order. 

 Yet in the first half of this first Baha'i century, two momentous things were occurring.  Every force making for change in the lives of men was being accelerated at a rate beyond any comparison with a previous era in history. Steel rails were flung across con —  tinents. 

 The human voice was projected aver a wire; the human voice was captured on a disk. The center of living was changed from a particular city, town, village, or isolated farm. 

 Travel and communication, with an awesome swiftness, revolutionized the area


<p758>
758             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  of men's activity. The practical meaning of time changed. The five continents, the seas and oceans of the world, and the islands on their waters, were all drawn steadily closer. 

 During this same period, Baha'u'llah, in prison and in exile, lifted high the spiritual banner of world unity and justice. 

 He claimed to be a Messenger of God, a Manifestation of Truth with the same spiritual power and divine authority that had characterized Jesus and the High Prophets of the past. He restated the spiritual obligations of man to God. He exhorted men to a life of honesty, truthfulness, purity, and service. 

 He decried the growing injustice in the world, the increasing blight and horror of war, the insidious poisons of racial prejudice, of class antagonism, of false national doctrines.  He urged the leaders of the world to assemble an international legislature which might act to remove the causes of the world's distress. 

 But the mighty ones of the earth ignored His plea, and so the world's peoples now move relentlessly through this bloody epoch, unconscious of the fact that a divine remedy has already been given to them. 

 The chief purpose of Baha'u'llah's mission is to establish worldwide justice through unity. 

 He has proclaimed: "The best-be-loved  of all things in My sight is Justice." And this is a proclamation of justice for all men. 

 Baha'u'llah did not mean justice for a certain class, for a certain race, for a certain nation, or for a limited combination of nations.  He looked at the world as a unit with planetary needs. 

 He regarded the needs, the hopes, and the possibilities of all men. He meant, quite literally, justice for all men, everywhere. 

 The keynote to this unity which Baha'u'llah  has declared the basis for universal justice, is the principle of the 

Oneness of Humanity. This  

 principle is neither "a pious hope" nor a mere restatement of the ideal of brotherhood. Baha'u'llah has established again in the heart and the mind the living reality of faith. He creates the desire to achieve justice for all men. 

 He creates an awareness of God's love and purpose. 

 He creates a desire to praise God in word and in deed. But far more than this, Baha'u'llah has inseparably joined the spiritual and the practical  aspects of life. The Oneness of 

Humanity                  

 ity is tcthe pivot round which all the teachings of Baha'u'llah revolve." 

 The social principles of Baha'u'llah — consultation, collective  security for the maintenance of peace, universal government, universal education —  these, and others, are all methods for establishing human oneness. Baha'u'llah places social action and responsibility on the same high level of obligation with individual morality. 

 In fact, the divine order for human society, found in the writings of Baha'u'llah, is so practical that, in its basic elements, it is being applied now among the Baha'is of the world. 

 By the Oneness of Humanity is meant that all human beings are the children of God; that there is no specially-chosen race in the sight of God; that differing colors of skin constitute an element of variety, and not an clement of innate difference or superiority;  that differences of religious background  are no longer a sufficient excuse for one group of people remaining aloof from another; that variations in political views and economic advantages do not constitute a justification for dominance and exploitation. 

 And the Oneness of Humanity requires the recognition of the equality of men and women. It requires the formulating of a world system of education, with some basic curriculum, and with this universal educational  program open to boys and girls alike. It requires the selection of an international auxiliary language to facilitate trade, travel, and communication. 

 It means that religion and science should be regarded as copartners, since they are the great and complementary instruments which can lead the human race along the road of decency and enriched living.  This dynamic principle also requires the erection of a world federal government, a super-government, representing the peoples of the earth, dedicated to justice without regard to race, religion, or region. 

 When this war subsides, the human and material wreckage will be dreadful. 

 We will see the evidence on every hand. And the statisticians wii compile their lists. 

 But they will not be able to measure the dark cesspool of hatred, of prejudice, of warped and croaked doctrines. 

 No limited nationalistic principle, no limited racial principle can serve as the basis for

  rebuilding our shattered world. We cannot return to the localisms of the past. The habits of the past are no longer safe. 

 The thinking of the past can only betray us now. The world needs the vision of Baha'u'llah. It needs the impact of His loving spirit. It needs the solid unity which oniy He can create. 

 We must, therefore, sound a warning that the Oneness of Mankind is "the sole means for the salvation of a greatly suffering world." 

 The American people, especially, are dial-lenged  by this principle. For this republic which has developed a high form of just government and which has many times stretched the hand of assistance to oppressed peoples, this republic harbors also one of the most virulent forms of race hatred. Millions of people in this country, because of a mere difference in color, are cursed with an economic,  social, and psychological stigma. 

 This is the gravest internal problem for the American people in these years when a world order is evolving. 

 Besides a warning, this principle, enunci ated eloquently and insistently by Baha'u'llah,  brings "a promise that its realization is at hand." The first beam of this sun of promise flashed across the darkened sky of Persia when the youthful Thib heralded a new religious dispensation. 

 The words of this Forerunner cut the thick veils of bigotry and ignorance which lay like a vast fog over that land. He inspired His followers to deeds of such valor that the promise of spiritual regeneration  in Persia was heard by great scholars in the continent of Europe. 

 The second  beam of promise might well be the announcement by lBahA'u'llAh of His mission as God's Manifestation in our age. The third beam of promise would be the embryonic world order, found in the teachings of Baha'u'llah and erected by the believers under the guidance of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Faith. 

 Shoghi Effendi has written: "Leaders of religion, exponents of political theories, governors  of human institutions, who at present are witnessing with perplexity and dismay the bankruptcy of their ideas, and the dis

  integration of their handiwork, would do well to turn their gaze to the Revelation of Baha'u'llah, and to meditate upon the World Order which, lying enshrined in His teachings,  is siowiy and imperceptibly rising amid the welter and chaos of presentday civilization." 

 Baha'u'llah already has created the impossible  — the uniting of peoples of all races and cultures in one worldwide spiritual community.  The methods and the standard of the Baha'i world community incline neither to the East nor the West, neither to the Jew nor the Gentile, neither to the rich nor the poor, neither to the white nor the colored. Within the Baha'i community, the Oneness of Humanity is already an accomplished fact. A divine pattern of world order has been given, and it is already taking form in the communities of Baha'is throughout the world. 

  The Oneness of Humanity    

 demands the moral and intellectual regeneration of the individual. Each age requires the new measure  of a man. Baha'u'llah sets the standard thus: "All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization. 

 "Bend your energies to whatever may foster the education of men." 

 Let your vision be world-embracing rather than confined to your own self." "Equity is the most fundamental among human virtues. 

 The evaluation of all things must needs depend upon it." "Be an ornament to the countenance  of truth, a crown to the brow of fidelity, a pillar of the temple of righteousness, a breath of life to the body of mankind, an ensign of the hosts of justice, a luminary above the horizon of virtue." "That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself  to the service of the entire human race.~~ The new measure of a man — what can create a new type of thinking and conduct? What force can so inspire and sharpen the minds of men that they may be fit instruments  for the creation of a just and enduring world order? 

 The answer is religious faith. Religion, renewed in our age by a Manifestation of God; religion, purified from the prejudices and superstitions of the past; religion,  restated in the terms of our age and fashioned for the needs and possibilities of our age — such a Faith, Baha'is are convinced, has the power to regenerate mankind. Such a Faith is the Faith of Baha'u'llah — a divine remedy sent by God for the healing of the nations and the resurrection of man. 

 The Baha'i lives and moves and has his being in the belief that the Kingdom of God will be established upon the earth. The Baha'i is that individual who, through the confirming power of faith in Baha'u'llah, struggles against the currents of disunity and prejudice in the whirlpool of public opinion, and struggles within himself, in an effort to rise to a level of spiritual maturity and social action where he lives the principle of the Oneness of Mankind. 

 The Baha'i is the promise and the sign that a new type of conduct  is being fashioned — men and women with a world vision and a sense of humanity that is deep and all-inclusive. 

  The Oneness of Humanity    

 also "implies an organic change in the structure of pres-ent-day  society." 

 Baha'u'llah foresaw that humanity was about to enter a crisis of unparalleled magnitude, and that the final resolution of that crisis would require the establishment of a world government. In the words of the Guardian of the Faith: "Some form of a world Super-State must needs be evolved, in whose favor all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining  internal order within their respective dominions.  Such a state will have to include within its orbit an International Executive adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the commonwealth; a World Parliament whose members shall be elected by the people in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; and a Supreme Tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect even in such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit  their cases to its consideration." 

 This world government would promulgate cca single code of international law — the product of the considered judgment of the world's federated representatives." Such a World Order as this which Baha'u'llah anticipated,


<p761>
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS              761

  would make the Oneness of Humanity a living fact everywhere upon the earth. 

 The spiritual regeneration of men and women, and the erection of a world government  will mark the beginning of the greatest era in human history. Slowly men have progressed,  from the filthy, diseased, superstitious, and ignorant conditions of the early ages. Starting with the tribal form of society,  larger and more orderly units of gov-eminent  have been evolved. The knowledge of men and their sense of idealism have also developed. 

 But the childhood of the human race is over. The wars and chaos of our time mark the height of humanity's adolescence. 

 World unity will mark the beginning of humanity's maturity. 

 Baha'u'llah heralds the achievement  of this goal. 

 The objective of His Faith is to unite the peoples of the world in tone faith and one order." This will be ~humanity's coming of age." 

 'We discover, then, that this pivotal principle of Baha'u'llah, the Oneness of Humanity,  is not ~ta pious hope" nor a mere restatement  of the ideal of brotherhood. It is a clear warning, yet also holds the promise of definite realization. It demands the moral and intellectual regeneration of the indik'id-ual. 

 It "implies an organic change in the structure of presentday society." 

 Finally, it "represents the consummation of human evolution." 

 Baha'u'llah has written: "This is the Day in which God's most excellent favors have poured out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into all created things. It is incumbent upon all the peoples of the world to reconcile their differences, and, with perfect unity and peace, abide beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and lovingkindness. 

 Soon will the presentday Order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead." 

 This is the consummating age, the climactic  age, the fruit-bearing age in human history. But a consummation is not an easy thing, no matter how much men may devoutly wish for it. A great climax is never reached without pain. The tree cannot bear fruit uniess the fragile beauty of the blossom dies, to be reborn in a form and with a substance  that will nourish men and women. The peoples of the earth dwell in the fear, misery, and blood of war. But this war marks the death pangs of the old order of materialism, of greed for power, of exploitation,  and of disunity. God moves in human history. His hand is above all things. 

 The old order is perishing around us. A new order, founded on the Oneness of Humanity, is taking shape under the guidance and protection  of God. 

 When we think at this Centennial, of the glorious events of the past one hundred years, of the rich treasury of truth in the Baha'i Revelation, and of the undreamed and immeasurable possibilities of the future, our joy is mixed with a great gratitude. Is it any wonder that 'Abdu'l-Baha has said: "Betold the portals which Baha'u'llah bath opened to you."

  virulent disease. The real disease from which the nations suffer is not the mobilization of troops and sacrificing of men on the battlefield.  Such atrocities are only easily recognized  manifestations of much more deep seated maladies. The source of the real sickness lies in the philosophy, organization and practice of everyday life. Our economic structure, our political system, our social attitudes and our religious fanaticisms all contribute to the inequalities, the dishonesties, the intolerance and prejudices from which wars are born. 

 In short, war is simply the inevitable outcome of our current thought and action. The public, however, seems to see little relationship  between its daily sowing and periodic reaping. To the average person there is no connection between these two phenomena. 

 Those who have studied the history of past wars are well aware that the consequences  of one are always the cause of the next. 

 It is a well known fact that the vanquished  nation ever nurses a hatred of its conquerors and dreams oniy of the day when it will be strong enough for revenge. It is futile to pretend that the social conscience is too enlightened; that the nations know they cannot afford a war; that the world is in possession of too many facts concerning the horror and iosses of war, and war, therefore, is impossible. The apostles of peace, even after the Munich pact, told us there could be no war. 

 But soon the war spirit spread over the continent, and in a few months men in Europe would have killed their own fathers, in spite of their facts and settled conclusions. 

 The world conflagration of 19391945 has conclusively proved to the world that fear and danger of war cannot be eradicated by military alliances between groups of nations, seeking to build up a strong balance of powers. It is the presence, the existence of large armaments that creates suspicion and causes the outbreak of war between those powers which are more equally balanced. 

 Peace is not a manufactured article. It is not created nor established by any human concept, no army or navy however great, no airplanes, submarines nor the more horrible means of extinguishing life that science has discovered, no Hague Tribunal, the League of Nations or the U.N.O. can bring about peace without the aid of spiritual powers. 

 Submission through preponderance of force is not peace. With the aid of science we have improved our method of killing and mass butchery, and have fallen, pitiful victims to the mactines of our own creation. One is reminded of the story of the missionary, who returned to his native land after many years spent among the cannibals, trying  to teach them civilized ways. A friend meeting him said, "Tell me, did you cure them of their loathsome habit of eating human  flesh?" ctw•ell no," said the missionary, at least not entirely, but I can report progress; I did teach them to eat with knife and fork." 

 Our progress appears to be merely the refinement of the weapons of destruction. 

     The San Francisco Conference

 of the United (?) Nations is undoubtedly expected to be a great step, preparatory to the downfall  and end of the present system of world government, where each nation presumes to keep up an armed force wherewith to settle its disputes. Unfortunately the members of the U.N.O. who are flushed with the fruits of their victory, have not yet realized that reconstruction of world conditions today with mundane ideas can never be done. It is like putting new wine into old bottles. Humanity needs new hearts free from the deadly poison of racial and national prejudices.  'Without this first requisite all efforts will be fruitless, and as useless as attempting to bring sensation back to a numb finger by rubbing it, when, at the base of it, a tight band is shutting off all circulation. 

 It is sages and seers, not statesmen and strategists, who can cement the differences that prevail between the various nations. The evils of race rivalries, economic competitions and armament disputes would vanish if the nations of the world realized that human nature and needs are fundamentally the same all the world over, and that in the eyes of God there is no difference between man and man. Past attempts at international amity and peace have failed because they were inspired  not by the true spirit of friendship and love which can be had oniy from an understanding of the universal principles of the Oneness of Mankind.

  pacts are to prove not mere scraps of paper, great care must be taken to eliminate distrust  and rivalry. 

 It is quite evident from experience that with the progress of science and the unification  of the world, this single body cannot advance smoothly under the guidance of different  and discordant consciences. Past methods of governing isolated groups are no longer workable as isolation is blasted with the birth of the atom bomb. 

 The more humanity clings to old methods and ideas the quicker the succession of wars and disasters; and the greater the intensity of conifict, the greater is its failure. 

 Economic strangulation and dismemberment  of the enemy nations through force and fear will not keep the peace; fear gives birth to hate, not to love; to revenge, not to cooperation  that endures. 

 Nations must learn to build up their fortifications not upon the sand of intrigues and hypocrisy, but upon the rock of God's love. Kingdoms and empires, raised upon the despoiled  and ruined ashes of smaller nations, are bound to disintegrate and decay. Mighty rulers and dictators have gone the way of the damned, but eternal are the glories that await those who bring prosperity and happiness to the world, for "Blessed are the Peace Makers." 
                           
           II.                        

 The world heaved a sigh of relief when after six years of bloody warfare the hostilities  ceased in 1945. The people unanimously hoped for a final and permanent abolition of war, and all the suffering, loss and destruction it involved. 

   The San Francisco Conference

 of the United Nations was called to realize, in whatever  measure it was possible, this longing of civilized humanity all over the world. With the best will in the world, however, the united wisdom and experience of the world gathered there, were unable to bring about a real union of mankind, which alone can remedy the ills of our age. "The Charter," said Field Marshal Smuts, CCwas not perfect. It was full of compromises; but it was a very real and substantial advance on all previous plans of security." This is not all that enlightened humanity craves for, though it was much more than had been at-tamed all through the age of competitive nationalism. 

 The San Francisco creation is oniy an association of states, claimed to be equal, sovereign, and ttpeace~lovingP~; their equality, however, inter se, is denied by other provisions of the Charter itself, especially in regard zo the Security Council, or the executive  authority of the organization; while their sovereignty is only in respect of their internal administration. 

 It was, however, this attribute of internal sovereignty which permitted Nazi Germany to persecute the Jews for long years without any effective opposition being raised by any other State; and the same excuse may lead in future to repetition of such persecutions and atrocities. Members, moreover, of the Organization do not include, at least for the time being, the erstwhile enemy nations, and their satellites, but also neutrals, like Switzerland, whose peace-loving character no one can question. The Organization, moreover, though formed expressly to maintain peace and security all over the world, to enforce respect for treaties,  principles of justice and international law, and secure full recognition for tehuman rights and fundamental freedoms," omits to define any of the key terms in the main chapter of the charter, giving the purpose of its being, and the motive spring of its action. 

 It has no armed force at its own command; it leaves local armies, navies and air force untouched, and offers but a mild suggestion for gradual disarmament of the principal allies and their associates. 

 Given these shortcomings, the Organization can scarcely be effective in attaining its immediate  objective of permanent peace and international  security, let alone the development of all-round cooperation ~mong the peoples of the world, especially if the Big Three fall out on any issue, as between themselves. 

 In all these respects, the machinery prescribed by Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith, for maintaining eternal peace and all round security, and ensuring world cooperation, shows unmistakable superior-fry. 

 The institution of a General Assembly of the nations of the world; the setting up of a Security Council as the Central Executive  authority; the establishment of an International Court of Justice, and the bring.

  ing into existence of an Economic and Social Council, are all landmarks on the road which, unmistakably and irresistibly, will lead to the goal prophesied by Him a hundred years ago. 

 But they arc not enough, excellent as they are. 

 According to the Baha'i Charter, however, the General Assembly of Nations will not be oniy a deliberative body, with little initiative and less executive. It will be a Sovereign Legislature for the entire world, defining the principles of justicc, codifying international law, and enforcing respect for human rights and freedoms. 

 The executive arm of the World Federation would be the Security Council, while the judicial side of the Universal State would be the International House of Justice, administering justice for all mankind in accordance with clearly defined  principles of that much misunderstood term. As no State or people will be excluded from the organization of the World State prophesied by Baha'u'llah; and as the basis of the Organization would be free consent and voluntary acceptance by member  States or peoples, there can be no question of any State being kept out of the organization. 

The General Assembly       

 of the Federation will be formed by representatives of all States, in proportion to the population  and resources of each, probably also with due regard to the record (and not pretensions) of each in regard to the love for peace, — and not merely in proportion to the armed importance of any member, as under the San Francisco arrangement it has come to be. 

 No people, backward or advanced, and no country, developed or otherwise, will be left out of membership. 

 There need, therefore, be neither a Trusteeship Council, nor a Trust of some stronger country over weaker members of the world community; and of course, no Ccstrategic Areas," serving as military or naval bases, to keep alive the memory of conflict, and indicate preparedness for a possible war. The 

Colonies and Empires       

 of today, — Dutch or British or French, — will have to go the same way as the domination and exploitation of subject countries by Germany or Japan; and the world will have to march with a true union of all mankind as brothers working in a common cause. 

 The Baha'i Charter will not depend, for maintaining peace and assuring security, on oniy coercive authority vested in the Central Organization. Ways and means of peaceful  solution of every kind of international dispute, without exceptions, will be evolved and employed, including conciliation, arbi-tation,  and where-necessary, ary, adjudication. No force will be left at the disposal of any individual State, large or small. 

 The process of disarmament will be progressive, simultaneous,  and universal. 

 The only available vestige of armed might will be at the command  of the World State. San Francisco also evinces unmistakable aversion to the use of force in settling international disputes. But the existing disparity of might as between  the bigger States and the smaller ones, and the provision for gradual disarmament, make its basic purpose of outlawing war far from realized. 

 This apprehension is all the better founded, when we recollect that there are still outstanding differences, in interest as well as outlook, as between the principal powers of the world today. While 

Britain, France and America

 uphold a social system founded on private property with personal profit, on individual initiative and freedom of enterprise, Russia upholds the communist ideal. Britain and France have colonial possessions,  which suppiy no mean proportion of their material prosperity; and on which other States inevitably cast eyes of envy. America seeks expansion on the East and the West; and calls it naval bases. The League of Nations  Mandates have ceased; but the Trustee Council and Trusts for Backward Peoples is only a new name for an old disease — imperialism and exploitation. 

 As a consequence of this difference in basic outlook, the relations between neighboring States, and still more so with undeveloped parts of the world under the domination or influence of any of these, cannot but diverge and lead to conflicts, which, in the ultimate analysis, may have to be settled by use of force. The Baha'i Charter, on the other hand, secures the essentials for the economic welfare of every nation. The World Commonwealth  is charged with the task of assuring  the welfare of all the nations arid of every individual therein. 

 It must, therefore, control the entire resources and raw mate

  rials of its component parts, provide every country with the necessary materials for its industrialization, and arrange for the natural flow of commerce and investment over the whole area that constitutes this earth. 

 A uniform coinage and currency, uniform weights and measures, and uniform standardized  terms of international trade, with equal access to the earth's raw materials, are bound to eradicate the causes of economic conflict. The same principles applied to individuals will bridge the gulf between capital and labor; poverty and unemployment will be annihilated, and no idle rich permitted to be parasites or drones in the human hive. Education is to be recast and ideals of justice revised. Such an education must not be the privilege only of the leisured few, but available  to every human being. No territory is permitted to remain undeveloped, but all must enjoy unhampered the privileges bestowed upon humanity by this Baha'i Charter. The disparity between man and woman, between races and peoples, which now disfigure the working of the world, must disappear; and the guaranteed rights of individuals, as well as communities, carefully defined and duly enforced. Let the nations of the world take heed, and not repeat the tragedy of Versailles sowing the seed for a more devastating conflagration. 

 Baha'u'llah, the author of the Baha'i Charter had warned the monarchs of the world between 18681870,  while suffering imprisonment for these ideals, that the world would be engulfed in fiery ordeals of world wars, and had reiterated  the fact that nations could attain permanent peace and stability through nothing  less than the principles laid down in that Charter. 

 It is impossible to lay out in this brief article the great results nations can achieve by uniting together under one world government.  The ideal of a single world federation is not merely a legal or constitutional matter. A searching analysis on the same lines is found in The Foundations of Peace, wherein the author, Prof. K. T. Shah, India's leading economist freely acknowledges his debt to Baha'u'llah. 

 Much depends upon the peopie's spirit of goodwill, justice and amity. The governments of the world, instead of wasting their time, wealth and energy, in building up alliances and hoping thus to abolish warfare, or ensuring their own particular victory must turn their attention to the Baha'i Charter, which is complete and cannot be improved upon. This is a crucial moment and the sincerity of the United Nations  is being weighed in God's balance. Let them not be found wanting, nor be branded by posterity as an assemblage of hypocrites and imbeciles. 
                           
           III.                       

  In the 18th century, Sir Isaac Newton, Bengel, Wesiey and other great thinkers and teachers of many schools of thought, renewed  their hopes regarding their expectation of the 

Return of Christ. This     

 belief, although  confined entirely to the Protestant communion; was shared by individual Christians in most, if not all, of the churches, and aroused, in some sections of Christendom, the greatest enthusiasm. 

 It was proclaimed  by bodies, such as Irvingites and Millerites, and became the distinctive tenets of various Adventist groups. 

 One scholar fixed the date as 1785, Bengel 

1836, William Miller 18431844
and Gumming 1866.          

 This attitude of religious expectancy was not confined to Christendom alone, but was shared by the followers of other world religions;  by the Buddhists for the advent of a Maitreya Buddha, by the Zoroastrians for Shah Behram, the Hindus for Kalki Avatar, the Muslims for the Promised Mehdi and so on. But, as in Christendom, so throughout the world, the universal expectation of an august theophany was vitiated by misunderstanding and led to no good result. 

 A rigid traditionalism cramped the souls of men. No organized religion in any quarter of the globe seems to have believed that the coming prophet would demand radical reforms and lift the people to a higher level of thought and conduct than that with which they had contented themselves in the past. Every re —  ligion looked for a vindicator who should be exclusively its own, who should justify its dogmas, reinforce its institutions and exalt it to a position of complete and unchallengeable  supremacy over the erroneous faiths of the rest of mankind. 

 Great was the perturbation when, in the midst of these conflicting beliefs, a youth of

  24 years, who called himself the Mb (the Gate) arose in Persia, and proclaimed himself to be the forerunner of Him, Who was to be the fulfillment of all these prophecies, the Gate through which mankind must pass to attain to the Kingdom of God. The Bib, who was born on the 20th of October, 1819 and proclaimed himself on May 23rd, 1844, was renowned for his piety and virtue. 

 Persia in those days was considered by the Oriental scholars as the Augean stable of the East. Ignorance, fanaticism, dishonesty and immorality  were the four pillars which supported the social fabric in 

Persia. That the IB~b      

 had expected a violent opposition from his countrymen was evident from his earlier writings in which he had clearly predicted his martyrdom; but nothing daunted him. Fearlessly he preached like John the Baptist, and prepared the people for the advent of Baha'u'llah, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith and Author of the Baha'i 

Charter.                   

 Within a short period the doctors of divinity, fearing the overthrow of their power, agitated against the Bib, and had him arrested  and incarcerated. But his message spread like wildfire kindling the hearts of all those subject to it. In their impotent rage these opponents of the Bab resorted to most violent persecutions recorded in the annals of history. Within six years of his ministry, most of which was spent in prison, the enemies of the Bab ordered his execution and on the 9th pf July, 1850 the Mb's body was publicly riddled with 750 bullets in the barrack square at Tabriz. 

 Chesterton has said that in modern times, instead of stoning the prophets, we smother them with roses. 

 We also after praising them without obeying them for a decade or two, cease to read them. But our experience of Baha'u'llah is quite the contrary. 

 People smothered Him with roses and paid Him the greatest respect as long as He remained the Son of a rich and influential minister of Persia, with vast properties at His disposal. But as soon as He declared Himself to be the Divine Messenger for Whom the B&b had prepared the people, and sacrificed His life, and for Whom the former world scriptures had prophesied, stones took the place of roses, hatred that of respect, confiscation of prop-cay cay and starvation that of riches and affluence. 

 Baha'u'llah was born on the 12th of November, 1817 and declared His advent on April 21st, 1863. He was convinced He had been destined for a great mission in life, that of uniting the various races and religions  into one brotherhood. His fearless and public declaration of His message terminated His life of ease and luxury. That government, which had respected Him and His family for generations, was deeply annoyed  at His seemingly audacious claim, and thus Baha'u'llah was clapped in chains behind prison bars with His wife and children,  all of tender age. While heavy chains cut wounds in His neck, He yet strove to help man to break the fetters of greed, selfishness, vanity and waywardness. 

 Although  Himself in captivity, He worked for the liberation of humanity. Thus between the years 18681870 Baha'u'llah addressed His epistles to the crowned heads of the world, to the President of America and to the Pope in Rome, wherein He laid down the principles upon which the Baha'i Charter is to be based. 

 Vividly He foretold therein the fate that awaited the different monarchs, nations and the world. 
  concourse of the heedless!"
He wrote, swear by God!    

 The Promised Day is come, the day when tormenting trials will have surged above your heads, and beneath your feet, saying: ~Taste ye what your hands have wrought!' The time for the destruction of the world and its people hath arrived. 

 The day is approaching when its (civiliza —  don's) flame wiii devour the cities. 0 ye that are bereft of understanding I A severe trial pursueth you, and will suddenly overtake you. 0 ye people of the world, know verily that an unforeseen calamity is following you, and that grievous retribution awaiteth you. 

 Satiated with power and peif and fully confident of their own powers, the monarchs  of the world ignored the call of this prophet of peace. He warned them again, predicting Divine retribution, downfall, defeat,  immense calamity. 

 The most daring of all is His categorical and reiterated assurances that after ~ period of worldwide purgation by the fire of war, human nature

  is to be regenerated, the nations federated and permanent peace established. 

 Considering  human waywardness He foresaw a hideous universal conflict, which would engulf every nation in the world. When they had wasted their substance, decimated their population and stood bleeding, bankrupt and beggared, then they would be restored to their right minds. People would then realize that national vanity and touchiness, truculency  and war preparedness are as terribly destructive in a state, as vanity, bullying and boasting are vicious in a boy. 

 When they have had their fight out, and are prostrate from their insane anger, they will be willing to look up to the Divine Messenger for guidance. 

 Baha'u'llah passed away in 1892, after suffering nearly forty years of imprisonment and exile, and after more than twenty thousand  of His followers, men, women and children, had been butchered to death in a manner that displayed the unwearying ingenuity  of the Persians in the mode of torturing their victims; they would sole the feet of their victims, soak the wounds in boiling oil, shoe the foot like the hoof of a horse, and compel the victim to run. In some cases the victims have been made to eat their own amputated ears. The more fortunate suffered strangulation, stoning or suffocation. They were Found before the muzzle of a mortar, cut down with swords, or killed with dagger thrusts. 

 These selfless heroes laid down their lives, without murmuring in order that their blood might water the seed of Baha'u'llah's New World Order. 'tA world from which war has been abolished, held together by ties of world federation; a great worldwide human society in which hatred and prejudices — national, religious, racial — have been annihilated. A world cub ture built upon close interchange of commerce, of art, of science and invention, a culture marvellously integrated by a universal auxiliary language serving as a common  medium for commerce, travel and for exchange of ideas in literature and by radio and moving picture. 

 A universal civilization in which men and women, shoulder to shoulder in full equality, labor to build a better world. A spiritualized humanity obedient to the Divine purpose, sensitive to the good and beautiful things creating art, culture and a mode of living superbly beautiful.  A world in which labor and capital harmoniously operate together under new economic laws which ensure abundant and widespread prosperity and abolish forever the grim spectre of want and destitution." 

 Unfortunately nations learn slowly and oftentimes at a dear price. It takes the incalculable  horror of a world cataclysm to teach the nations of the world how vain and how unworkable are the worn out ideas of rival empires, safeguarded by armed forces, and how practical is the idea of federation secured by law, and based on love and human fellowship. 

 Now that the world has just emerged bankrupt and bleeding from threatened annihilation, after this ruinous war, is it wise and just to continue ignoring the principles laid down in Baha'u'llah's Charter? 

 It appears like yesterday, when under the stress of the blitzkrieg and the fear of in —  vasion, the governments and the clergy of the various nations urged their countrymen to flock to churches and pray to God for the removal of our trials and tribulations. 

 Is it not strange that when the prayers have been answered, God has been relegated to the background? 

 In all our Peace Conferences and Peace parleys, all mention of God is eliminated? 

 All reference to the power of prayer ignored? 

 By this indifference is not God being tempted to visit upon humanity once more a cataclysm more ruinous than the last war, to impress upon the puny minds of men, that there is a Greater Power in this world that can compel mankind to submit to His will and carry out His Plan? 

 Must humanity like the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrali invite fire and brimstone  (with the aid of the atomic bomb) from the heaven of God's wrath, to remove man completely from the surface of the earth? 

 Is it possible that mankind prefers extinction to a life of peace and brotherhood?

             IMPRESIONES DL UN DELEGADO
           BAHA'I DURANTE SU VISITA A LOS
            BAHA'IS DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS

                  B~ SALVADOR TORMO

  C UANDO fui elegido representate de Pa comunidad Baha'i tie la Argentina para con-currir  a ios actos a realizarse en 'Wilmezte con motivo del centenario de la F6 Baha'i y la convenci6n en mayo dcl corriente afio, fu6 ~ste uno de los momentos mas emocionantes de mi vida. Pude percibir en ese momento, en cierto modo, ci profundo y trascendental stgnifcado que dicha representacion invol-ucraba,  no tanto por lo que a mi persona se ref eria, sino mas bi6n a Ia responsabilidad que dicho nombramiento significaba como in-strumento representativo y legal de la corn-unidad  Baha'i argentina. 

 A pesar de todo nil empefia para con-currir  a los actos anunciados, no pude conse-guirlo;  el permiso lleg6 tarde. 

 Pero el 4 de junio recibi un cable de la Asamblea Na-cional  para asistir a las reuniones que tendrian lugar en Wilmette del 9 al 16 de julio. En poco tiempo pude arreglar todos los asuntos. Las puertas se abrian en todas partes; Ia mano de Baha'u'llah actuaba en todo mo-mento. 

 El 29 de junio liegaba a Chicago en avi6n. Mi sorpresa fu~ al. descender del mis —  mo y escuchar una voz amiga. AllA, a dos pasos, se encontraba Mrs. Collins acompafiada de Miss True; ~us rostros sonrientes produ-jeron en ml una extrafla pero agradable emo-ci6n.  En tierra extrangera encontraba de inmediato no solamente a dos amigas sino a dos hermanas. Miss True nos condujo en su coche hasta Wilmette. Con Mrs. Collins recordamos nuestra actuacion en Buenos Aires en la construcci6n del monumento a la memoria de Mrs. Maxwell, recuerdos agra-dables  por cierto, a! haber intervenido en urn obra tan importante. 

 Miss True tuvo la gentileza de hacerme conocer el Templo a la hora del crepiasculo. 

 All ilegar cerca, me hizo notar entre los ~rbo1es la silueta del Templo. 
Que visi6n maravillosa!    

 momentos que jam~s se podrAn olvidar. Es en verdad un manatial de agua de vida, en donde millares de seres van a beber. 

 Pude presenciar grupos constantes de visitantes quienes atraidos por diferentes motivos, entraban para conocer el Templo. Me gustaba observar sus rostros; a la salida no parecian las mismas personas; sus ojos tenian otra expresion; parecia que ilevaban algo que antes no poseian; los guias habian hecho su trabajo; les habian explicado diversos aspectos dcl Templo, su significado y su relaci6n con Ia F6 Baha'i. Es maravilloso el trabajo que los guias realizan diariamente con tanta pacien —  cia como devoci6n por la F~; no podemos ni siquiera sospechar hasta donde ilegan las semillas que los guias depositan en tantos corazones. Esa es una obra silenciosa pero efectiva. A su tiempo vendrin los frutos. 

 Fuf invitado varias veces a acompafiar a los guias y en algunos momentos les ayu-daba,  ya que la gente se maraviliaba al corn-probar  cuan extendida estaba la N Baha'i, al saber que yo venia de 

Ia Argentina.              

 Un lugar de gran recogimiento para me —  ditar, es donde se encuentra la piedra fundamental.  Piedra hist6rica, colocada alli por las Manos del Maestro, 'Abdu'l-Baha, en ci aiio 1912. En diversas oportunidades or6 en ese sagrado recinto. Cu~n intensa es la vibraci6n espiritual alli percibida. 

 Las reuniones ilevadas a cabo desde ci 9 hasta el 16 de julio constituyeron en si Ia expresion de una organizaci6n perfecta par pane de Ia Asamblea Nacional. El dia 9 de julio pudimos vivir los mismos momentos que tuvieron lugar durante el centenario, por medjo de discos y vistas cinematogr~fi-cas;  los discursos y alocuciones alusivas a dicha fecha, fueron escuchados con prafunda devoci6n; las traducciones aI espafiol fueron realizaclas en todo momento con perfecta maestrift, pudiendo los delegados latino-americanos  disfrutar a la par de los demAs

  de estos actos tan significativos como bril-lantes. 

 Uno de los momentos mas culminantes fu6 cuando, siguiendo uno al otro lentamente y en prof undo silencio, presenciaban las foto-grafias  del B&b. Momentos emocionantes fueron estos para todos. Las reacciones, no cabe duda, fueron diferentes. Instantes estos que no se olvidadn jam~s. 

 Las reuniones de los delegados latino-americanos  en la Asamblea Nacional (en que se discutieron diversos asuntos) se lievaron a cabo en Ia mas perfecta armonia y corn-prensi6n, asicomo tambi~n Las reuniones realizadas entre los mismos delegados. 

 La simpatia y amor generados por ci contacto diario de los delegados latino-amencanos lleg6 al p unto que ninguno queria hablar dcl momento de Ia partida, Las lAgrimas asom-aban  nuestros ojos cuando ese momento lleg6. 

 Silencioso, cada uno guardaba sus recuerdos. 

 Los lazos que se habian forjado eran fuertes, pero habia que partir, aunque la despedida fuera dolorosa. Ya nos veriamos otra vez. Ya nos escribiriamos desde nuestros respectivos paises. Esos lazos de uni6n inter-americanos entre los Baha'is se habian real-izado.  Asi he podido observar como se han ido tejiendo nuestras amistades, por medjo de los miMtiples contactos. 

 Jantis he podido constatar tanta generosidad, tanta buena voluntad, tanta consideraci6n, tanto amor como lo expresado por los Baha'is americanos. Tengo contraida una gran deuda de gratitud por las generosidades de todo orden recibidas. Mucho tendr6 que hacer para pagarlas. 

 En todas las reuniones a que hemos con-currido, los delegados siempre hemos encon-trado  ese espiritu de franca simpatia entre los Baha'is. Tanto en Wilmette como en Evanston, Chicago, Milwaukee, siempre se di6 a los delegados la oportunidad de ex-presarse. 

 Era digno de observar la expectativa mostrada en rodos los rostros al saber que los delegados latino-americanos iban a hablar. Cada manifestaci6n de los delegados era acogida por los circunstantes con salva de aplausos, reveladores de Ia simpatia que estos esperimentaban. 

 Todo discurso era traducido de inmediato, con Ia mayor perfecci6n, en ambos idiomas. 

 La persona que tenia a su cargo esta tarea, Mrs. Woolsen parecia in-terpretar  hasta el minimo detalle, d~ndo1e a La vez el sentimiento que en cada caso era necesano. 

 Seria largo enumerar los distintos lugares en que fuimos invirados. Podria ilenar muchas columnas de papel. En todas panes pude observar la misma simpatia. 

 No podria citar un solo caso que pudiera haber habido una nota discordante. 

 Recuerdo en Milwaukee, despu6s de haber pasado un dia en la residencia de campo de los esposos Niss, lugar hermoso par cierto, fuimos invitados, los delegados, al Centro Baha'i de esta ciudad. Una cena excepcional y muchos amigos nos aguardaban. Se escu-charon con devoci6n las oraciones y los

 Al final, tomAndonos de la mano los delegados latino-americanos con los Baha'is de norte-am6rica, exprese: ttLevantemos las manos juntas como simbolo de unidad que en estos mornentos aqui se realiza. Que Ia fuerza de esta uni6n se extienda por todo el continente americano y tambidn por todo ci mundo." Me faltan palabras para describir lo que este acto produjo en ios corazones de los amigos presentes. 

 Aun aquellos que no eran Baha'is vinieron a saludarnos emocionados. Todos srntieron la realidad de esos momentos, mo-mentos  que perdurarAn en las mentes y los corazones de ios amigos. 

  Fui presentado a Baha'is   

 que habian tenido el privilegio de ver a 'Abdu'l-Baha. 
Entre ellos Mrs. True.     

 Fui invitado varias veces a su casa, en donde pude escuchar de sus labios hechos muy interesantes del Maestro. Fui invitado a pasar unos dias en la casa de campo de Mrs. Stewart. Lugar encantador es Otter Lake. Pudimos conversar sobre muchos aspecros de Ia Causa, tanto en Esta-dos  Unidos como en Sudam6rica. Recordamos muchas veces cuando ella, cinco afios atrAs, me hizo conocer la F6 Baha'i en Buenos Aires y sobre los progresos realizados. En Nueva York fui invitado en casa de los esposos Mottahedeli. 

 Ellos tambi6n estuvieron en Buenos Aires. Tanto ellos como mi amigo Philip Sprague se desvivieron por hacerme conocer los lugares mas importantes de Nueva York. Fui presentado al Centro Baha'i, en donde fui invitado a expresar mi pensamiento. Mucha simpatia encontr6 en todos los amigos. Mas tarde fui invitado por los esposos Mottahedeh a pasar el fin de semana en Ia escuela de verano de Green Acre. 

 En ci momento mismo que iba a regresar, un ilamado telef6nico de Nueva York, me hizo quedar alli por tres semanas. Fud tan a tiempo, que unos segundos mas y hubiera dejado de conocer muchas de las ensefianzas que aprendi por medjo de los cursos que diariamente alli se dictan.

 No tengo palabras para expresar cuAn feliz me send al convivir con los Baha'is que, como y6, estaban pasando alli unas semanas. 

 Una vida diferente, un mundo diferente. He liegado a pensar que cuando el mundo viva La vida que se vive en Green Acre (y con esto incuyo tambi6n las otras escuelas de verano existentes) viviremos en un mundo mejor. Mi estadia alli me di6 la oportunidad de conocer a mucha gente. Todos se in-teresaban  por la Am6rica Latina. He podido observar que hay un inter6s latente en todos por Ia Am6rica dcl Sur. Todos querian conocer y yo gustosamente les explicaba todo aquello que estaba dentro del radio de mi conocimiento. 

 Al notar tanto inter6s por todo lo que se referia a Ia Am&ica Latina, mc ofreci a dar una clase diana de espaiiol. Esta se efectuadaba todas las tardes bajo de Los pinos. Qu6 felicidad me produjo dar esta clase.

          BOLIVIA                   

  EARLY one hot December morning in 1943, after several false starts with anticlimactic  despedidas, (farewells) the plane schedule got together with the weather and I was actually on my way through the lush outskirts of Asunci6n del Paraguay to the tiny airport built beside the huge modern airfield which was still under construction by the North 

 Americans. Gertrude       

 Eisen-berg,  seeing me off, looked small but valiant. She was left alone to carry on the task of keeping together and teaching the group started two years before by Elisabeth Claeney. This little band had been restimulated by my visit and it had grown during these last four short months. Gertrude, who had recently arrived, found the ninth adult, who, that following April, made possible the formation of the first Spiritual 

 Assembly of Paraguay.    

 As only one plane a week went out of Paraguay to the North, obtaining passage was a problem with or without priorities. The plane was well burdened as we flew up the broad winding Rio Panar& into the jungle country. In a few hours it arrived at Cor

  umbA, a far corner of Brazil. It was only hot then, not very hot, or impossibly hot. The little river port town in the heart of the continent had the usual plaza, an avenue of magnificent royal palms, a U. S. Navy Catalina floating at anchor, and much tropical fruit for sale. All Brazilian cars seem to have long ornate satin cushions resting in the space between the rear seat and the rear window. There were even the taxis which are, as in all other places, just passenger  cars charging a more or less uniform fare depending on whether one looked like an experienced or inexperienced gringo. Panagra passengers are put up at a row of houses serving as "hotel" — all very informal. 

 The next morning we flew over the river and over the Chaco country, making many hops into cleared spots in the jungles. 

 The plane carried Indians — one with a little pig under her arm and manta — chickens, cargo lashed to the front seats and men in tropical work clothes. Quite a contrast to the formal travel of more frequented lanes. 

 At one place we landed near a little cemetery where a little band of Indians weirdly sounding rondadore~ (pipes of Pan), crude drums and quenas (flutes) were pounding and wheezing beside the tombstones, and the passengers stood about while the plane loading proceeded.  We were in 

Bolivia.                   

 Santa Cruz was our stop for the night. We were certainly on the Local-Stops-at-all-Points plane! This interesting but primitive  colonial-type town was seen oniy from the air, as Pan Air has fine modern accommodations for its passengers at the airport.  After boarding our plane in the morning we gradually climbed, and instead of jungle, we were over high stark dramatic

  mountains, gorges and peaks with only color — no vegetation whatever — in short, the high Andes. 

 The broad and watered valley of Cochabamba (most popular resort of the Bolivians) was a contrast. There I saw my very first Cochabambina, a lovely chola (a class of mixed Indian and other blood) walking  primly in her high stiff white stovepipe hat with broad brim (the higher the hat, the richer she is) with her colored fringed manta or shawl, many wide colored skirts, high boots and long black braids to give her great elegance. 

 Leaving healthful Cochabamba, we flew on and on, higher and starker, along the Altiplano with its relief map appearance until we reached the rim of the great Andean gash in which nestles La Paz. 

 There we left our twin-motor 21-passenger Douglas, and after good hot coffee and a toasting by the fireplace,  we took the cabs to the edge of the rim, and dived down the winding steep spectacular  descent into the city below. 

 There was the great mountain, Illimani, gorgeous and resplendent in brilliant snow watching over the city from far over the other side, just as Eleanor Adler had seen it when her train wormed in from the Chilean port of Arica two years before. At that time, there were no Baha'i friends to take her in and make her comfortable, upon her first encounter  with such a strange land — 12,025 feet up, and not a word of Spanish, completely  alone. 

 Not really alone, because the company of His chosen angels" was there to guide her immediately to the house of Yvonne Cuellar, who soon became the first believer in Bolivia, and who opened the way ardently for the spreading of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in that land. Seven months later, Eleanor left Bolivia leaving a glorious trail of interest in the Cause, and four devoted and capable believers. 

 To this very house of Yvonne Cuellar I, too, went, and there found my Baha'i home in La Paz. 

 More Baha'is had been added, all helped and inspired by Flora Hottes, loved and able pioneer who had arrived  in the past year. Many friends came to hear about and discuss the Faith with us. Suddenly there came the terror and unrest of a revolution — and then, a few days later, Christmas, bringing little boys in small troups making queer Incaica music on drums sad quenas as they went from house to house to play and dance for the Nifia Dios in His little manger. 

 Very early on New Year's Day I left for a trip to Sucre which is the Capital, although the President lives in La Paz, the center of all activity. The Supreme Court meets in Sucre, named after the Mariscal Sucre, one of the famous South American heroes. 

 Although  there is much antagonism and national rivalry among these countries, they all fervently observe the birthdays of their mutual heroes and liberators — such as the great Sim6n Bolivar, San Martin, Sucre, etc.! 

 All alone in my camarote or sleeping compartment, I sketched scenes of the bare altiplano, flat beige-colored plains with never a tree or a flower, small windowless houses of adobe and thatched roofs, each with its tiny cross with holy water jug on top; Indians  squatting in heavy ponchos in the rain — rain leaking into the cars and deluging one between cars while jerking one's way to the comedor. This was a voyage of adventure through all the other cars: chair, second, third classes always getting more crowded with cholos, children, baskets, and more wet, as the dining car is always on the end of the train and has a little chimney stack. A school girl on vacation who shared my room returned at night after spending the day with other friends on the train. The bunks were arranged one over the other and all bedding was stored on the top one during the day. One cannot be exclusive and buy up the whole camarote, but this is at least one room which is shared oniy with one person of the same sex! 

 Early morning found us in the completely unique 

Villa Imperial de Potosi.  

 There loomed the famous pyramid-shaped Cerro Rico (Rich Hill), the nearly untouched colonial city spreading down the long slope. All the silver to finance the Spanish Armada came out of that hill. They said that I was the first white woman to look upon the vast and varicolored valley from the lofty top of that cerro (and this I like to believe!). Other women there were — in their many long, brilliantly colored skirts and man-type felt hats, working the mines along with the men. But only tin is now taken after the

  workings of four centuries. 

 Idle llamas gazed at us with supercilious aristocratic air as the heavy truck struggled up the steep winding  slippery road. 

 Cable buckets passed overhead carrying down the ore which oniy llamas used to bear. 

 Four days were spent in Potosi while waiting for the autocarril which goes to Sucre. At the Rancho Hochschild where I was privileged to stay, the mine officials were most hospitable. Much to be remembered were the long drive through rarely visited country; movies of ancient vintage shown in what had been a precious carved stone church built by the Spaniards; the Moneda where all the coin of Bolivia has been minted — the machinery brought from Spain and powered by oxen or slaves — the machinery of centuries commencing with wooden apparatus,  down to present day steel; the Mascar6n, a huge Bacchuslike face in natural  colors over an archway, said to be the caricature of a former governor. One evening here around the fire of sweet-smelling moss clods from the Alto, the world's travail and the great remedy brought by Baha'u'llah were discussed with these Jewish friends, who among the millions, had been forced into pain and change. 

 A six-hour run in a 4-motor Chrysler bus on railway wheels was spent in gasping delightedly  at some of the loveliest and most dramatic bits of this earth that one could wish to see. 

 The driver enjoyed chasing donkeys, goats or sheep off the tracks, corn —  ing as near as possible without touching them. 

 It seemed extraordinary to leave one great valley, oniy to climb suddenly into another having a round mirror lake; then to descend gradually into a land full of spectacularly flowering cactus, pepper trees and into the sweet valley where is sequestered the city of Sucre. 

 The four-day sojourn seemed much longer — so many things happened! 

Immediately, don Ratil    

 Jaimes Freyre, the distinguished writer and educator; brother of the great Ricardo, man of letters, was found in his house, house of the Inquisition of former times. 

 It was the scene also, of a latter-day inquisition" during the lectures given there on the Faith of Baha'u'llah, as the intellectuals and artists gathered to hear, ques — don, cavil and believe — some to read and promise deeper study of the teachings. 

 The tiled white city of Sucre is an isolated paradise.  Life parades so leisurely across the cobblestones using no busses or street cars. Charming and courtly are the people, but impossible for an outsider to know without proper entr6. 

 Like Potosi, it is still dreaming  of Spanish days and is proud of its withdrawn culture. To sit, or Cchacer el paseo," around the Plaza near noon and at dusk, is to review one's friendships. 

 Much pain, as always, was felt at leaving such dear, if recently found, friends. Back to Potosi I journeyed with only time for dinner at the Rancho before catching the train for La Paz. 

 There I found Alicia Bustamante, the famous Peruvian artist who had shown such lively interest in the Faith while in La Paz. The long return was spent with a school teacher and her friend, who enjoyed hearing of the new world Faith destined to unite all of mankind in harmonious living. 

 There was an invitation to visit their school. 

 Twenty-four hours later, at nightfall, from out of the complete blackness of rain clouds suddenly we beheld the magic lining of twinkling lights in the enormous  bowl of La Paz beneath the splendor of a well washed full moon. 

 Great Illimani sparkled adamantly in its manta of silver snow. 

 And there was Flora Hottes, loved pioneer for Bolivia, comfortably resting in my bed when I arrived. 

 She bad just returned from a much needed change of altitude to Lima. We listened to stories of her experiences with Eve 

Nicklin in Peru. The      

 last few days were spent in endless visa and permiso de salicla hunting, and again the usual false starts. 

 The delays made it possible for me to see again the wonderful Bolivian friends, and to visit a very quaint and interesting annual fair — Feria de las Alacitas. 

 For several  days booths are set up by cholos in a plaza where one can buy, in miniature, all the objects of one's desire for the coming year. 

 Sadness crept on me at leaving the valiant country of Bolivia where a culture of great interest has been built up and maintained under almost insuperable physical difficulties: killing altitude, inadequate transportation,

  It was in an expectant but nevertheless sad mood that I left Eve Nicklin's generous hospitality at three-thirty that damp November  morning of 1944, to go all alone in the taxi, which stopped only once to be identified by a bundled-up ccagente de po-licia."  On the way to the Limatambo airport there was time to think of the many things connected with leaving Peru which had meant the heights of thankful joy, and some considerable depths of woe. What would be the events of the new post in Ecuador? 

 John Stearns was approaching his release from pain in that lonely Lima hospital after a year's stoic and uncomplaining fight with a fatal disease. Indeed, he died on the afternoon of the next day. 

    Doris and Willard McKay    

 met John sometime  in 1937. In their home he enjoyed the music, sports; and most of all, the happiness he found there. 

 His own marriage had been dissolved. After the 1938 Annual Baha'i

Convention and Emeric      

 Sala's description of it in a talk at Jamestown, New York, he began to study the Faith. 

 "The magic of Green Acre Summer School confirmed 

John," writes Willard      
McKay.                     

 "It seemed so wonderful to him, that when he had driven me home to Jamestown, John drove that five hundred miles back to Green Acre to find out whether or not he had imagined it! 

 John's acceptance seemed to release Jamestown from its inhibitions and the first Local Spiritual Assembly  was formed on April 21, 1939, with a Babi'i community of fifteen members. 

 John was an ardent teacher and committee worker. 

 Just when he decided to go to Ecuador I don't know, nor do I know what gave him the final impulse." 

 He prepared himself by studying Spanish and taking a course at the 

Louhelen Baha'i Summer      
School in Michigan.        

 So it was, then, that John prepared to leave his home in Jamestown, New York, to go to Ecuador, undeveloped in the measure of the world's progress, and unknown to him, a place where few people could understand  his language and his ways, a high equatorial land, where no vestige of its former  glory of gold, jewels, plumed warriors, and almost legendary culture remained. The Inca had built up his civilization for hundreds  of years oniy to watch it torn down, stone toppling stone, ruthlessly and greedily crushed and eliminated by the 

Spanish Conquistadores.   

 Today their descendants wander,  busy, or idle, rich, but mostly poor, about the streets of what was once San Francisco de Quito — streets following the same contours  of the luscious green valley of perpetual  Springtime. 

 They see only remnants of the Spanish splendor begun by four hundred men whose names can still be seen engraved on the wall of the Cathedral building  in the mother country's own or borrowed style, from the very stones of the Incas —  stones so laboriously hauled from faraway quarries. Descendants, all, of the same four hundred men who had taken to themselves women from the conquered, whether they wished it or not. 

 John left his own land, as have many others in their times and ours, to introduce the Cause of God in its renewed and ampli fled beauty where it was not before known. His mission was to tell of the new ideologies ordained by God for the age of destiny into which we are being thrust. As a boy he must have had unconscious foreknowledge that his lot upon this earth was to be hard and full of pain. In unrelenting stoicism he used to sleep on the floor without covering so that he could go into the woods and not be concerned if lacking in comforts or even being lost. He was the uncompromising leader among his brothers and sisters, and his advice in all matters was always asked, even by his mother. 

 They were resigned, then, and not surprised at his tearing up of all roots of home and starting a new life in a far-off city which straddles the equator. Although not sharers in the same Faith, they respected his unbending decision to carry out his mission. 

 On May 23, 1940, John arrived in the capital city, Quito. For a while he lived in a pension and taught English in the In-stituto  Cultural in order to become acquainted with people. He was soon making plans to import machinery to start a candy-making  business for his support. Candy in the European or North American style is a rarity in some South American countries, but much liked by its peoples. After many months of communication concerning finances  and transportation, the Kandy Kitchen was established in a "modern" apartment. And here ~iso, the first Baha'i meetings were held. 

 A South American always asks a ~~gringo" (who can be nearly anyone not of the country  — but mostly it applies to United States citizens) why he has come to the South. This is the cue for the Baha'i pioneer to tell of the Cause, and it brings forth varying forms of response. Of course, in all of Ecuador, the Name of Baha'u'llah had probably  never been said unless Martha Root had paused in the port of Guayaquil for a few hours and uttered the Greatest Name, while making her trip around the Americas about twenty-five years-ago. 

 Mr. and Mrs. E. R. Mathews also touched the port, I believe.

  gent young man of Quayaquil came to hear from his lips the story of Baha'u'llah and the destiny towards which the world is so rapidly moving. Eduardo Gonzalez Lopez left the house only after a full night of discussion  — a convinced believer in this new World Faith, although he did not sign until a year had passed. John and ccL~~ shared many months of study, hard work and of bending all efforts for spreading the Faith. John spoke and CCL~~ interpreted, they made translations, and broadcast radio programs. It was a busy time and certainly not without its dissonances. 

 The radio programs were broadcast for about a year. Words and Music, and Baha'i Echoes were made into booklets and distributed as far afield as the broadcasts themselves. 

 Soon these two young men saw many perSons  rallying to this new Cause. Some left Quito to go to other parts, or out of the country, so there were never enough in one place to fort-n a Spiritual Assembly. 

 During this time some Baha'i travellers had stopped over in Quito and Guayaquil (where John had made a brief sojourn). Among these had been Eleanor Adler on her way to Bolivia,  Marcia Steward en route to Chile, and Mr. and Mrs. Rafi Mottabedeh who greatly helped and encouraged John, Philip Sprague, Mrs. Mary 

Barton, and Etta Mae       

 Lawrence who was on her way to pioneer in Argentina. 

 in October 1943, John discovered that the pain he had tried to ignore for so long was a serious illness. Two months later he made a long, painful land trip to Lima for treatment at the Hospital de Radium Ther-apia,  leaving his business with Baha'i friends, as he would never admit the thought of not recovering. Eve Nicklin, pioneer to Peru, helped him and tried to comfort him. He endured all pain and the torturing treatments almost without comment. After a cable from the Guardian whose prayers had been asked, John had a period of seemingly regained  health. 

 Some of this time he spent with Raymond Betts, American business man in Lima, lying in the desert sun by an intensely blue pool, with not a trace of vegetation  anywhere, where the subjects of the Inca had bathed hundreds of years before. Here was discussed the Faith of Baha'u'llah, although Ray had heard of it previously from Eve and Flora Hones. Later, on April 21, both became members of the first Spiritual Assembly to be formed in Peru. (The story of Peru has been told in another place.) Shortly after this, John knew that he must have another opcration, which he bore, watched over by Irma (Mrs. Ray Betts) who took him into her borne. He lasted a short time oniy. He seemed to make himself endure until the return of Ray Betts who had gone away on a long trip. Then, in a hospital on November 7, 1944, he died. Eve, Irma ~nd another friend were with him on that afternoon. 

 The beloved Guardian wrote, "The radiant  and selfless services of dear John Stearns will not be forgotten, and the country is in —  deed blessed where a pioneer not oniy taught but remained and died while still loving and glorifying his Faith." 

 The believers in Ecuador left by John became scattered. 

 Help there was needed and this task fell to my lot. In Lima, during the months from January to September he had sometimes told me of his work in that land. Two months' interval was spent in Bolivia where my instructions were received to proceed to Quito, Ecuador, since Arternus Lamb was unable to stop there on his way to his mission in 

Chile.                     

 Five hours flight only from Lirna, it took to reach Guayaquil, port town, where lack of war time priority made a stopover necessary.  While awaiting decisions in this matter,  a conversation began with a delightful Chilean woman who was on her way to New York. We found that we had met before in Santiago de Chile at the home of one of her relatives. Her brother and his family had been among my first friends. 

 His satirical  political paper, To ~aze, had made hii~n famous as well as his production of several motion pictures. Jorge Delano was later to be invited to the United States by its President,  who was also one of his distant cousins. Senora Delano de Sierra had recently returned  from a stay in Punt Arenas, Magal-lanes, the world's southernmost city, where she had met Marcia Steward, pioneer to Chile, and had become most interested in the Cause. Argentina was also the scene of her meeting with many believers.

778             THE BAHA'I WORLD

  That night in my hotel, 

Eduardo Gonzalez and Emilio

 Minervini, two of the faithful ones of Guayaquil (young Jorge Sarco was the third), came to see me. 

 But next morning  early the trip towards Quito was resumed.  Rivers, jungles, tropical flowering trees, higher and higher — past the great vo'-canos,  Chimborazo and Cotopaxi, past a wooded, shelved tableland — which were enchantments,  and into the neighboring valley where is situated one of the oldest precious cities of the Andes — Quito. 

 Just as surely as the world of the Incas, from Quito to Tiahuanaco was stripped and wrecked by wars, so in our time do we see the mighty convulsion — only on a worldwide  scale. 

 The old values are being swept aside in Ecuador, in South America, and indeed  all over the world. 

 It is the Baha'i who proclaims the source of the impulse which is revolutionizing mankind's ordered life —  this in his small but ever-widening orbit. His soul-shaking duty is to bring orientation to the participants in this disequilibra-tion; his duty to set in motion the actual knowledge of the meaning of the already pushing down and ruthless change which disturbs peoples of our time. The World Plan brought by Baha'u'llah clarifies and gives direction to this process. 

 Quito, now, was to see an attempt at the continuance of John's labor. Only three handicapped believers remained. However, activity for me was rudely curtailed by prolonged and persistent neuritis. Change of living quarters and medical aid did not help. On the night of Christmas, unsleepingly pondering why such obstacles should be presented  when a Spiritual Assembly was the intense hope for April, it occurred to me that perhaps Guayaquil was the destined spot. 

 Air passage was obtained the next day, for only a moment's delay would have meant a month of waiting. A trip of seventeen to twenty-four hours on an Ecuadorian train was unthinkable, ending with its midnight dark ride across the River Guayas on the antiquated boat "Guayaquil," and always the possibility of wading over washout; this being the beginning of the rainy season. Young Chico who had served me well helped me to pack, or rather to throw things into my case and the books into a carton which fell apart upon being taken off the plane. About an hour after leaving Quito I was on my way to a comfortable bed in the Gran Hotel, Guayaquil. 

 The tropical heat thawed out the pain in two weeks. 

Through ties" Gonzales     

 I became established comfortably in a guest house run by his aunt and an English woman. 

 Here also we were able to hold the first real Baha'i meetings in Guay-. aquil — the upper room arranged with seats, desk, table, lamp, ferns and flowers and, most important, Baha'i books and pictures. In Guayaquil c!Les~3 had gathered two other faithful ones who had come from Quito. ttLes" had been the delegate from Ecuador to the Baha'i Centenary held in Wilmette at the Baha'i House of Worship in May and also the meeting for the Latin-Americans in July of 1944. His attendance at Baha'i Summer School and Convention had greatly inspired and informed him. He, it was, who had kept alive the Faith in Guayaquil. 

   From January to April      

 we worked together,  the four of us — gradually adding others. 

 One more came from Quito; still another believer reawakened to active effort. Friends were met and brought to the gatherings held regularly. The date of April 21 crept nearer and the tension which Eve and I had experienced in Lima the year before was repeated. A young medical student, Guillermo Molina, who came to exercise his scientific learning at the Baha'is' expense, left with fervent expressions of conviction of Baha'i truths. He soon declared his m-tendons  but insisted that he would examine thoroughly, so as to be sure of his action. (Commendable, yes — but would he convince himself by April 21!) Suddenly he and another serious and fine young man, who had felt himself not worthy, begged to be accepted. 
April 8 came bringing      

Haik Ke-vorkian  from Buenos

 Aires. He was to do pioneer teaching in Guayaquil, and arrived oniy after lengthy procedure of travel. April 17 found us needing one more, as neither Haik nor I was eligible to be on the Spiritual  Assembly, neither one having a permanent  residence visa. 

 The person nearest to joining us was a lovely Norwegian exile, who had a beauty shop. During the three hours it took to have a permanent wave some heart-deep questions were asked. After

  receiving the replies, she fell silent for a time. 

 There was no sign of effect until, just as we parted, Else Jorgensen asked that she might sign! Even the weather seemed to cooperate, as the RAINS had remained in the clouds at least on the evenings of our meetings! 

 So, in the upper room, surrounded by our Baha'i books, pictures and many flowers, in the hot breeze of the electric fan — each in his (!best~~ and with happy smiles — the first Spiritual Assembly of Ecuador was formed! The memory of John Stearns was very strong with us as we all felt that he was happy at last over the flowering of his devoted and selfless labors in that land. 

 During a series of medical treatments there was the opportunity of telling a distinguished  physician of much influence of the Faith. He declared himself a champion of anyone working for this Cause. He was one of many of all classes thankfully hearing of, and welcoming this pure and dynamic Power for improvement of conditions, social and spiritual. 

 May 17, 1945 was the date of my reluctant farewell to Guayaquil. This new Baha'i Community seemed especially remarkable as it consisted of very young people. Five men of unusual attractiveness and capacity, all under twenty-five, one of thirty-two, and two women but a few years older. Haik Kevorkian, whose family came to Argentina as pioneers with the Guardian's own counsel, stayed with them to help develop and strengthen their Assembly, to continue his work well begun, that of giving the example of how young people — or any people — can successfully live the high standard of Baha conduct in a world which seems to have forgotten (if it ever knew) what life on this planet can become. The declared aim of these young people was to form a nucleus, ever growing, of an inviting example  of living, to their compatriots in Ecuador. 

 "The companions of God," Baha'u'llah Himself has declared, ttare in this day, the lump that must leaven the peoples of the world. They must show forth such trustworthiness, such truthfulness and perseverance,  such deeds of character that all mankind  may profit by their example.. Within the very breath of such souls as are pure and sanctified, far-reaching potentialities arc hidden. So great are these potentialities that they exercise their influence over all created things."'~ 

         PARAGUAY                   

  The plane circled high over the city. Like a symbol and omen of what might transpire on the new venture, Santiago de Chile lay below us, decked in a morning veil of mist and smoke. 

 Ahead was the flight over the conquered Cordillera of the Andes. The new post in Paraguay was not easy to contemplate;  it would not be easy to follow the devoted and selfless Elisabeth Cheney, who, two years before, had established a small group of believers under great handicap, in the capital city of 

Asuncion.                  

 The hour's flight over the brown and snowy white mountains seemed but a few minutes of smooth ecstasy. 

 I thought of Martha Root, twenty-four years earlier, in the autumn months of 1919, wending her way over the steep and tortuous trails on muleback. For her there had been no lolling comfort, no gazing out in rapture, or reading of the morning paper while skimming over the dangerous gorges and past the menacing peak of the Aconcagua. 

 Martha had struggled for days to hang on, to avoid sliding down the mule's neck, or slipping into eternity over a precipice. 

 It seemed significant as well as gracious, that Roberto Herera Ramirez, the first aviator  to fly over the Andes with a passenger —  twenty-two years ago — a Chilean, and destined to be one of the first believers in Baha'u'llah in Chile, had come to the airport with his brave wife, Eugenia, to bid me farewell.  Now, while still young, they see his dream of continental air travel realized, his effort, with its tragic result of crash and long illness, recognized and rewarded by his government. 

 The four hours over the Argentine pampas  revealed oniy a vast flat cultivated plain, without any visible gauchos. The biggest bus in all experience carried us into Buenos Aires, South America's most modern city,

  but there is much reminder of Paris in its tree-lined boulevards, sidewalk cafes and European architecture, now being crowded by the new. 

 During the two weeks' stay in Buenos Aires, I met most of the Baha'is, and as usual, deep roots of friendship were quickly put down. South America's first Baha'i martyr, May Maxwell, by her love and sacrifice,  seems to have inundated these lands with her spiritual presence. She could never endure the cold, they say, especially spiritual coldness. Now the warm and shady peace of Quilmes is her abode, and the refuge of all who approach it. The hours spent there with Etta Mae Lawrence, dear dedicated pioneer, and Haig Kevorkian, will not be forgotten. Courage to face Paraguay was gained there, I think. 

 The mystic chain of Baha love is strong; in Montevideo it also held our hearts. 

 The friends everywhere are growing through tests and obstacles secured by iove. The Guardian has indicated great and important responsibilities  for Argentina. These devoted friends have the will and capacity for accomplish.-rnent. 

 The early morning hydroavi6n trip started with a long and profound swoosh through the waters of the Rio de la Plant before its release into the air. The Delta and Tigre, seen from the air, were quite unlike the place of waters, boats, flowers and sweet-colored colonial houses that I had visited some days before. Flying up the wide and later twisting, turning river — stopping at several small and primitive towns, we came, after about five hours, over Asunci6n, set in a bend of the river in the midst of the tropical  lush plain that is Paraguay. 

 Across the river from the small but modern port could be seen only green trees, undergrowth and the red, red earth — the smoke, blue misty, of charcoal burning in the distance. 

 As I emerged from the port alone, after the usual customs procedure, I found it a bit surprising to see a few cows wandering about loose; not many people were about, as it was the middle of the day and siesta time. It was rather lonely. The hotel, with its dark columned interior patio was nearby. I could hardly wait to meet the Baha'is. Only one who has tried it can imagine the sensations of the first days. Panic was in my heart. I began to appreciate Elisabeth Cheney's task, and uttered supplications for the fruition of her great labors. Soon the two devoted believers, Josefina PlA and Centurion  Miranda, were found by directions and much walking — there are few telephones in Asunci6n. 

 They had kept alive the Faith in spite of obstacles and inexperience. 

 In the small gathering of our first Feast celebrated together, two persons who had been loyally studying, declared themselves believers. 

 This was great encouragement, but the encountering of the "waiting servants" in a country strange, and with few opportunities, presented a baffling problem. Then one day, in a most miserable moment, came a letter from our beloved Guardian. It arrived  with its divine encouragement and mysterious action-provoking effect. 
Then my perturbation ceased!

 Shortly, I found myself established in a private home recently turned into a pension. Here were discovered the first of the new crop, as the duelia and her talented daughter soon became believers. 

 Through them and the other friends new contacts were made. Soon a radio interview was proposed, on the subject, Motion Pictures. After writing the script the night before and having the Spanish corrected the next morning, we went on the air, and the Sacred Name of Baha'u'llah was mentioned for the first time from Paraguay.  It was a precious moment when the Name soared clearly by short wave over all of South America. The interviewer became a believer soon after, and also a young technician. 

 Later there were invitations to sing on the radio. 

 By helping thus on a program in honor of one of Paraguay's poets, I gained the opportunity of meeting writers and musicians. Abilities seem to sprout in most extraordinary ways on a pioneer venture. 

 The equipment of a diplomat, psychologist, accountant and physician would be no small advantage! 

 How well the Guardian foresaw needs when he advised me in a cable to ctri patience"! Having patience while eternally waiting for believers, or anything at all, in these lands of siow tempo, is a state which anyone must cultivate, should he wish to remain in one piece.

  Many meetings, celebrations, Feasts took place in what had become for the time, our Baha'i Center. Every day brought someone to hear of the Faith, or a chance to present it. Talks were given to the Theosophists and to the Rosicrucians. At a banquet, the guest of honor, Sir Eugene Millington Drake, well-loved  Englishman known all over Latin-America for his generosity, charm, and the direction of Cultural Affairs for Great Britain, was seated between two Baha'is. There, for the first time I encountered the brilliant young poet Augosto Roa Bastos, later to become much impressed by the Faith. 

 Wandering about the streets of Asunci6n, picking one's way among the sharp cobblestones and admiring the sweet little donkeys, laden with vegetables, meat, fruits, and their little (always) women riders with long hair in a knot sticking out in back, and nearly always with a cigar in their mouths and, in hot weather, a large, black umbrella aloft, is the accompaniment to sowing the Greatest Name in the atmosphere of this land. Bril —  liant blue is the sky whcn not convulsed with thunder storms. Feathery flowering trees of violet jacarandi bloom. 
Flaming colors are everywhere.

 Curious flat-twigged trees with bunches of yellow-pinky flowers bursting out of the ends, later to sprout large waxy green leaves, are the jasmine-mango  trees. 

 Papayas, guayavas and kapoc trees are abundant. 

 The latter have trunks like coca-cola bottles with thorns sticking out all over them. The flowers are like orchids, and the fruit like huge avocado pears. 

 And then the kapoc silk pops out and runs over with a most fantastic effect. At Feasts we used quantities of large gardenias as they cost only six cents for a dozen! 

 Our Baha'i house, being typically Paraguayan, had rooms in a long row, all opening  onto each other, and also having huge double doors opening onto the long patio. The well was nearby and a small grove of orange trees and jasmine vines grew in the cleanly swept garden. And pensionistas were bound to hear of the Faith. Some Brazilians and some Argentinians left with a new outlook  and the determination to find the Baha'is in their country. 

 Many persons who do not become believers right away are excellent "carriers" and there is always the hope that sometime they will convince themselves in an ardent moment. 

 Speaking of the Faith in the village of Luque, which we reached by means of a little wooden-car train drawn by a round fat locomotive  followed by two little cars full of fuel wood, chugging, spewing smoke, and then the return in the evening, watching sparks from our engine (not so diffrrent from the huge lantern-eyed fireflies) are nice to remember. 

 The poet, Julio Correa, gave a party there in his lovely old quinta, in honor of a neighboring poet. Many of us, including josefina PU, and Gertrude Eisenberg, trouped there that day. 

 His colonial house, shaded by huge old trees, had a column-supported porch all around it. Cows stalked about, not bothering to hide their disapproval of so many strangers taking their shade. Chickens wandered in and out of the house. 

 The poets recited their latest poems, although during business hours, they might be bankers, engineers,  philosophers or actors. Sila Godoy played his intimate and exquisite instrument, the guitar, 

Like a young Segovia.     

 Barbecued pork (delivered in wheelbarrows), dulce de cafia (sugar cane drink), empanadas (a sort of meat pie seen with variations all over South America) and potato salad were devoured  on the porch near the immense breadfruit tree. 

 Life is still fairly simple in Paraguay in spite of the struggle between the old ways and the new which are fast taking possession.  Unbelievable changes arc under way, such as the huge new airport, new hospitals (where goats and families will not be permitted  to live with the patient), new roads, sanitary systems, and public health programs. Of these gifts and importations from the United States, many have been fearful, but others begin to see the deep significance of all this physical activity as the preparation for the spiritual and material union of the countries of the Western Hemisphere. 

 The North Americans charged with these works, have as yet no conception of the deeper meaning and are not interested in knowing. Paraguay is emerging in a phenomenal manner  from its age-old slumber interrupted by tragic wars which lately have destroyed most of its male population. Its disturbance i~'

 With Gertrude Eisenberg, their pioneer and teacher, the Baha'is of Asunci6n dcl Paraguay, as the fruit of Elisabeth Cheney's initial impulse and many sacrifices, established  their first Spiritual Assembly in April, 1944. 

 A multitude of persons have heard of the Faith in this mysterious flowering Land. A curious acceleration of confirmation has taken place — the wishes of the beloved Guardian have had their effect. The destiny of this loved country is being seized and is animating an awaiting people. 

 I shall remember Paraguay for its poets, its perfumed music under the brightest of moons beside the Southern Cross, its flaming flowering trees, its loving sensitive souls, eagerly listening to the creative Words of Baha'u'llah which tell of their liberation from age-old cares. The Guardian wrote: are at last beginning to see the first tangible response to Baha'u'llah's words addressed  in the Aqdas to the Presidents of the American Republics: lie lights of the Faith are kindling in these distant lands and will shine, no doubt, with a wonderful brilliance in the days to come.

               THE SPIRITUAL CONQUEST
                    OF MAGALLANES

                   B~ ARTEMUS LAMB

     .INIAGALLANES (Spanish     

 for Magel-Ian)  ," says the Encyclopedia Britannica, "is a territory of southern Chile extending from 470 

S to Cape Horn     It      

 is one of the most inhospitable regions of the world, being exposed to cold, westerly storms for most of the year." Its name comes from the fact that through it runs the famous Straits of Magellan.  The principal seaport and commercial center is Punt Arenas (Sandy Point), a busy little city of some 40,000 souls composed  of Chileans, Spaniards, Yugoslavs, British, Scotch, Scandinavians, Germans, French, ttHindus" (any one who comes from India), "Turks" (Abbas, Turks, etc., most of whom are Moslems), one couple from the United States of America, and a temporary group of geologists, drillers and their families  who are helping the government search for oil. 
 Outside of the native      

Chuleans, the Brit-ish-Scotch 

 and Yugoslav Colonies are the largest, the former having come, many years ago, to develop the now famous sheep industry  of Magallanes, Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The latter, it is said, owe their origin to a shipwreck of a Yugoslav trading vessel, whose survivors discovered gold upon the beach and forthwith notified their f am-ilies and friends at home. 

 The remaining inhabitants have wandered here almost entirely  with the single aim of making their nest egg and some day returning home, wherever that may be. All speak more or less Spanish, the official language of the country. 

 In regard to the weather, an item of vast importance here, although the storms and winds still blow, and there is a scarcity of sun, the climate is yearly growing milder in Punta Arenas itself (why nobody knows) and it could now hardly be termed "one of the most inhospitable regions of the world." 

 Into this setting, from Santiago, in August 1943, arrived Marcia Steward, Baha pioneer  to Chile from the United States. 

 Shoghi Effendi had urgently requested that an outpost of the Faith, a Baha'i community, be established in this most southerly city of the world. Marcia was given the opportunity to add new laurels to her distinguished services in Chile-by initiating the foundation of the Faith in this unique city. 
   The first word of the      

Baha'i Cause reached Punta 

 Arenas.in 1937, when Mrs. Stuart W. French spent a few hours in the city while she and Mr. French were on a cruise. During

  this brief stay Mrs. French encountered a professor in the schools who proved to have attended a Baha'i banquet in Los Angeles, California, some years before, at which Mrs. French had presided as the chairman. 

 At the conclusion of their visit together the professor rejoiced in the gift of a copy of Baha'u'llah and the New Era, in the Spanish  text. 

 Marcia Steward, however, became the first Baha to undertake the gallant task of establishing the foundation of a Baha Center in this distant land. Throughout the many trials and difficulties of these first ioneiy months, although she was frail in health, Marcia's valiant spirit was constantly supported  by the encouragement of the Guardian,  and her efforts were blessed with success. Fourteen months later, when the writer of this article appeared upon the scene, he found a Baha'i class meeting each week, knowledge of the Cause widely diffused, its principles recognized, people of influence and authority cognizant of its literature and deeply interested  in its Teachings, and Marcia, with an ever-growing circle of devoted friends — a valiant soldier of the Army of God who had been aided to another victory for 

His Cause.                 

 The arrival of the writer in Punta Arenas, on October 2nd, 1944, to support the teaching  work so auspiciously begun by Marcia Steward, marked the culmination of a series of astonishing events in the unfolding pattern  of Magallanes' spiritual destiny, and of the human instruments used in the process. 

 For some months before the Centenary Convention held in May, 1944, in 

Wilmette, the Guardian     

 had made repeated appeals for additional help to Magallanes, expressing the hope that a man could undertake this post. In response to these pleas the writer made known to the Inter-America Committee his willingness to go. Many seemingly insurmountable  obstacles lay in the path and many changes of plan were made, but finally on August 11, he sailed from Los Angeles on the "Rio de lix Plata." 

 His plans at that time called for a month's stay in Ecuador and a subsequent business tour of South 

America.                   

 A week later, while in the harbor of Acapulco, Mexico, the ttRio de la Plata" burned and sank. 

 On the strange chain of circumstances that followed it is not neces sary to dwell. Six weeks later a very dazed pioneer went to work in Punta Arenas, without  having visited Ecuador, nor made the proposed business trip, but holding in his hand a letter from the Guardian, whose personal postscript commenced: ~ am delighted to learn that you have at last reached your goal and are wholeheartedly engaged in your noble pioneer work in that distant land." 

 The growth of the Cause in Magallanes then entered upon a new phase. Marcia returned  to Santiago for a few months and the Local Spiritual Assembly of Santiago dispatched one of its members, Esteban Canales Leyton, to serve as the official pioneer to Magallanes. Esteban was the first Chilean believer to undertake pioneer teaching work, and one of the first Latin Americans to arise for the support of the pioneer field in the Southern Hemisphere. 

Esteban, formerly a Catholic

 Youth Leader, was a member of the Santiago Assembly and was elected the Chilean representative to the 

Baha'i All-America  Centenary
Convention.                

 A cablegram came from the Guardian, "praying early formation Assembly." 

 Up to that time we had not thought of such a possibility  for there were still no local believers and apparently no immediate prospects of any. However, quietly, almost mysteriously and without any seemingly coAscious effort on our part in the selection, one by one began to appear prepared, spiritually-minded, sincere  souis, rising above materialism, and the tradition-bound lethargy of the general population. 

 In March, 1945, word reached us of a message of the Guardian to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, calling attention to "the great importance  of Magillanes as a center, and the necessity of extending it every assistance, so that this Baha'i year an Assembly may be firmly established there." On April 5th a personal letter from the Guardian assured us that his prayers would sustain us in our efforts to form the Assembly that month. We were confident then that victory was ahead, although there were still no local Baha'is. 

 Then on April 15th was held that never-to-be-forgotten evening meeting in the tiny kitchen of Esteban's house when eight won

  derful "waiting servants" arose to answer the call of God. All except one had come from other parts of the world, and surely are fulfilling the purpose for which they came. ccThe tongue is powerless to describe" the joy and beauty of that night which we shared with the new believers whose names follow: Sr. Hugo Arteaga-beitia, Mr. Olaf Arrundscn, Lina

Villagr4n and Julio Cesar  
VillagrAn.                 

 What will be the future of this remarkable  place in which the Guardian has displayed  so much interest? At the moment a national airline is in contemplation, as well as the building of the canal of Ofqui which would closely connect Magallanes with the north. The direct air route from South America to New Zealand lies directly over Punta Arenas via the South Pole. 

 The establishment of world commerce, as now visualized, by air and sea could easily make Magallanes, like Singapore, the crossroads of the world. Hitherto unexplored and unsuspected natural resources, in quantities of undetermined scope, are now being discovered here. 

 On April 21, 1945, the Guardian cabled the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada his happiness over the establishment of ctth structural basis of the administtative order in the most southerly city in the world" and added: 'N urge the Inter-America Committee to devote special attention and to undertake prompt measures designed to increase the number of believers, establish local administrative headquarters,  and multiply the subsidiary agencies indispensable for the maintenance of a flourishing  Community in the southerly extremity of the southern hemisphere. 

 Praying for ever-increasing successes. 

 Spiritual victories are in sight of such proportions as to exceed our fondest hopes, and to inspire us with renewed energy that they may be fulfilled.

  lIT WAS early spring, 1937, when the Franconia drew into the harbor of Manila. We had been promised twelve hours ashore, but when the time came the Captain shortened our stay to four hours, due to tides and winds and other things ag~inst which there is no argument. 

 Four hours only! These would be precious minutes in which to find a place that would receive and distribute the Baha'i literature in Spanish and English we had brought. 

 Quickly we engag~d a carriage and asked the driver to take us to a bookstore — to the best one in Manila. 

 He nodded and we set off at a brisk pace until presently we drew up before a large and imposing shop. To the man in charge the purpose of the visit was explained, but he shook his head vigorously, asking did I not know that without the Archbishop's stamp upon it no book could be received? Perhaps, it was suggested, the prelate might permit a religious book, not Catholic however, to be accepted, if we drove to his palace to secure the permission. 

 "No! No!" replied the manager excitedly. 

 "N will he allow such a book as you describe to be placed on the shelves of any book store of Manila!" 

 His words were only too true, as we found everywhere we turned. Two hours, golden drops of time, had already passed. At length, in desperation, we asked to be driven to the address of President of Manila College. There we were received pleasantly and questioned courteously as to why we wishecEto have literature  there. 
 If we did not have the

  bishop's permission, was the literature then antiCatholic? 

 We assured the President of the college that it was not 'tanti," but was to spread ideas of universality in religion —  in all religions — to bring them close together. Finally, after considerable thought he said, CtJ~ the college library we have one small shelf allotted to comparative religions. As I remember, it is now overcrowded, but you might try; the librarian is very liberal minded." 

 We thanked him and hurried on, scarcely daring to look at the time. Something frantic showed in my face as I broached the request to the librarian to accept a few pamphlets for the shelf of comparative religions. I held up the thinnest among them to let him see how little space they would require. 

 Still he hesitated, all the while shaking his head. Overwhelmed with the intense need, I cried out, "But you must take them! 

 We have come thousands of miles that you should have the blessing they will impart to these Islands!" 

 ttVery well," he replied thoughtfully, tCj shall take one into the other room and look it over, perhaps we could use one." Up and down the narrow room I walked, praying fervently, beseeching Baha'u'llah to soften the heart of this man and permit these precious words to rest on this Island. In a little while the librarian returned smiling and said, ~~There is nothing adverse in your little book. You may place one or two of the Spanish pamphlets on that top shelf." I hurried forward and pushed the thick voi-umes  apart with all my strength, and left four little volumes shining out from among the ancient faiths that stood ranging on either side. 

 Just as the gong sounded for the last fifteen minutes before sailing, we mounted the gangplank. 

 So far to come, so little accom —  pushed, rang a sad refrain in our hearts. But we were forgetting that this is God's Cause and that it is He, and not we, who brings forth the blossoms and the fruit. 

  When the Franconia docked in Los Angeles in April, 193 8, a letter awaited us, postmarked  from the Philippines, and signed, ttMddl" It read: "Only a few days after your visit to Manila, I left Solano and went on business to Manila, where, having a little time to spare, I dropped into the reading room at the college library. 

 On the shelf of comparative religions I found four new little books. I took one down and sat enthralled. This was the religion I had been seeking as long as I could remember! One after another I read the four little books, forgetting time and place. Finally, I took my pencil and jotted down sentence after sentence. Then, as in a dream, I returned to Solano, and calling my wife and our two families, I told them that the religion we had so earnestly sought was the Baha'i Faith and that we must all embrace it. We accept this Faith, we rejoice in its tenets, and we are anxious to be enrolled in the beautiful 

Faith of Baha'u'llah.      

 God, the All-Powerful, has made the tree blossom." 

 Before long the Baha'i community had grown to fifty members. When war broke out all communication ceased with the Mad-delas or with the Baha'i Assembly of Solano. The weary months of war dragged on until the summer of 1945. Then, in September, once again news winged its way from the Philippines — this time from the brilliant, devoted Baha'i, Alvin Blum, attached to a medical unit with the United States Army. 

 ~ left the 249th General Hospital in Manila," writes Sgt. Blum, "where I am stationed,  and hitchhiked 223 miles to reach Solano where there had been a Baha'i Assembly.  Solano is in ruins. It had been a thriving city of more than twenty thousand people, before the war, while now it is reduced  to oniy a few thousand. 

 I soon located the Maddelas, happy and full of spirit, in spite of their impoverished condition. Before the war they had been influential and well established but when the Japanese came they were forced to leave everything and flee for their lives. Now, with ten people living together, they have only a grass hut of one room. They cook over an open fireplace and their dishes and cooking utensils are crude and handmade. Of the fifty enrolled Baha'i members, twenty-five have been killed or are missing. 

 For three years the Maddelas hid in the rice fields, living under such conditions that it was miraculous they survived.

  As a result of the bombings and terrible hardships, Mr. Maddela's hair turned snow-white  and he became totally deaf. They were all overjoyed to meet their first Baha'i visitor and we talked of our beloved Faith until night fell and I went to a nearby field hospital  to sleep. 

 There I secured some food and clothing for them and we had another happy reunion in the morning. 

 They are fine, intelligent people; both Mr. and Mrs. Maddela have taught school and are held in high esteem. 

 Before the war they had built, with great effort, a Baha'i Center, and had placed a sign at the entrance inviting everyone to come to their Baha'i reading room. At last, they told me, when they were able to come out from their hiding places in the rice fields, they returned to find the city a mass of rubble, their home destroyed. Only one thing was standing! 

 It was a sign which read:  

~tBAHA'i CENTER — READING

  HEN I first read the fortifying, faith-imbuing  statement of Baha'u'llah: ccThey that have forsaken their country for the purpose  of teaching Our Cause — these shall the faithful Spirit strengthen through its power. A company of Our chosen angels shall go fort]? with them, as bidden by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise. 

 How great the blessedness that awaiteth him that hath attended  the honor of serving the Almighty! By My Life! No act, however great, can compare with it, except such deeds as have been ordained by God, the All-Powerful, the Most Mighty. Such a service is indeed the prince of all goodly deeds, and the ornament of every goodly act," I felt reinforced with an assurance that I would never hesitate or be afraid to go to any foreign country in the service of the Holy Cause of Baha'u'llah. It was, then, in response to the Guardian's appeal for pioneers for Latin America in his message to the 1939 Convention that I was privileged to go to the beautiful land of Costa Rica. 

 Costa Rica, the heart of the Americas, with its friendly, warmhearted people of world renowned hospitality, its rich picturesque  scenery and delightful climate, is a jewel among Latin American countries unsurpassed in its beauty and charm. 

 The name of this tiny Central American republic lying  between Nicaragua and Panama means ~Rich Shore" which bears eloquent testimony to the country's wealth of blessings. 

 It was on March 23, 1940, that Mrs. Amalia Ford, the other pioneer, and I boarded the United Fruit Company steamship, the S. S. Ulua, at New Orleans, and headed for Costa Rica where we were to carry God's new Message which Baha'u'llah proclaimed to the world to cure the ills that exist in society by establishing the Divine Teachings He revealed for the unification and spiritual regeneration of humanity. 

 On our way, the boat made a day's stop at Havana, Cuba, where we were met at the dock by Philip and June Marangella, the first pioneers of that country. We spent a wonderful and eventful day with these devoted pioneers who have lent such valuable services to the establishment of the Baha Faith in Havana. We spent a memorable afternoon in their apartment that day where we were gathered with the first Baha'i of Cuba, Sr. Perfecto Perez, and held a memorial meeting for Mrs. May Maxwell, the great international Baha teacher, who had recently  laid down her life in the path of God in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

 After thirty-eight  years of consecrated, selfless service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah, "her earthly life, so rich, eventful, incomparably blessed" was crhil ended." She who had won the ttpriceless honor (of a) martyr's crown" and

  who has been titled the ~'Mother of the Latin races is a shining example and great source of inspiration to all Baha'i teachers. 

 We landed at Puerto Lirnon, the Atlantic port of Costa Rica, on March 29th, after an extremely pleasant week's journey. Landing on Costa Rican shores was like entering into a new world. A thrilling new world it was, indeed, for I found myself, all at once, amidst Spanish speaking people, with different  customs, temperaments and way of being.  Not knowing Spanish at the time made this world especially new to me; Mrs. Ford, though, was well-versed in the language. We were immediately impressed with the friendly, cordial attitude of the people making us feel welcome the instant we set foot on their soil. 

 A most picturesque and fascinating trip was the hundred mile journey inland from the port to our final destination — San Jos6, the capital city. 

 It is regarded as one of the most beautiful rail trips in the world. 

 Along the coast are the usual palm fringed bays, inlets and rivers and the typical beautiful vistas of the tropics, while the interior is high up in the mountains. 

 An ever changing panorama of large banana, cacao and coffee plantations, sugar cane, cocoanut palms, tropical fruit and flower trees, orchid plants, valleys, rivers and streams, native huts with their friendly peasant owners waving at the passengers is disclosed as the train winds its way up the mountains until the lofty peaks of the Cordilleras, backbone of Central America, appear majestically on the horizon. 

 No less exhilarating than the magnificent scenery is the invigorating change that takes place in the atmosphere, introducing a springlike  tang in the air as one Leaves the warmer coastal region and is carried to the bracing altitude of the interior. The view throughout this section of the journey may aptly be described as breath taking. The whole valley of the Reventazon River may be seen with one sweep of the eye with the rushing river itself appearing as a tiny, narrow ribbon of white foam a thousand or more feet below the train. 

 The charm and delights of Costa Rica grew hour by hour, and a highlight was experienced as the train, approaching San Jos6, made a steep, winding climb into the heart of the mountains. The heights were seen above where San Jose is embedded, and as we went higher and higher, it was as though we were ascending to some mysterious, unknown kingdom high up in the heavens. A heart-gripping emotion was sensed as we reached the capital, the new recipient of the light of Baha'u'llah's teachings for world unity, universal love and spiritual brotherhood, an emotion both of gratitude for the privilege of being a bearer of this glorious message to this virgin territory, and of awareness of the great responsibility which such a mission implied. 

 San Jos6 is a beautiful, modern city, bordered on all sides with inspiring mountains. In addition to the numerous attractive parks, one sees an abundance of trees and flowers, occasionally an entire tree covered with red, yellow or lavender flowers adorning its setting.  It has approximately 80,000 inhabitants,  the majority of whom are of almost pure Spanish descent. The altitude of the city is about 4,000 feet above sea level which gives it an ideal springlike climate the year around with an average sea level temperature of 70 degrees, somewhat cooler at night. Every morning is a bright spring morning in San Jos& There is no autumn or cold winter. 

 The trees, shrubs and grass are green, and the flowers bloom throughout the year. It has two seasons, the dry season from November to April and the rainy season during the remaining months when its rains in the afternoons, sometimes until evening, but the mornings are generally lovely and sunny. San Josd has been becoming more and more a summer resort. 

 In Costa Rica one finds a peaceful, peace-loving, hospitable people, rich and poor alike, and a tranquil atmosphere with none of the hustle and bustle of the large cities of North America. Life moves along in a leisurely sort of way, and the visitor eventually comes to realize that, after all, a little more of the "mafiana" spirit helps to make life more enjoyable. The beautiful innate qualities of the Latin Americans make them splendid Baha. 

 They are a people of exquisite human feelings. 

 They are kind, courteous, loving, friendly and tactful. 

 They are extremely careful not to hurt anyone's feelings, a trait which is a natural inclination of their sensitive  natures.

  intellectual capacity, possess a keen sense of humor and are poets by nature, as among them the ability to compose poetry seems almost universally prevalent. Because of these characteristics and the growing trend toward liberalism, the Baha'i Teachings have found great receptivity in Latin America. 

 Our first opening in getting our Baha'i work started in San Jos6 was made through the Chamber of Commerce where we inquired about groups interested in liberal thought. We were informed that Sefiorita Esilner Mezerville, a former director of the Girls' College and a member of the Theosophical  Society was the one to see. The kind gentleman giving us this information even telephoned her and made an appointment for us to see her. She was a charming, gracious lady of dignified bearing who listened to the Message with interest. She took us to visit Professor Roberto Brenes Mesen, wellknown Costa Rican educator, writer and poet, and his wife. In the course of our conversation, we were delighted to learn that lie had spoken in the Temple some years ago when he lived in Evanston and taught at Northwestern 

University. Miss Mezerville

 also contacted  the president of the Theosophical Society in our behalf, who invited us to their hail where Mrs. Ford presented the Message. We found the Theosophists receptive to the Teachings and to be our true friends and collaborators. 

 Things moved fast for us and within a month after our arrival, a weekly Baha'i study class was established. The few attendants  we had were from the Theosophical Society and other contacts that were made. At that time we were living in a pension (boarding house) and the landlady gave us permission to use her dining room for our class. A funny incident occurred after our first meeting when the landlady had a sudden change of heart, and as the friends began to arrive for the second meeting, she firmly informed  us that under no condition could we have our meeting there. We felt we had the right to use our own bedroom so we invited the friends in there but the lady would not allow us to use any of her chairs. 

 With the use of the edge of the bed, some of our suit cases and the one lonely chair we had in the bedroom for seats, we happily carried on our meeting. Through the efforts of one of the friends, a small apartment was soon found for us where our meetings were conducted with freedom and regularity. 

 Rapid progress was made with the marvelous  cooperation of the friends.. One would bring a relative, another a friend to the meetings and they would take active part by speaking and presenting papers they had written on the Teachings. They showed wonderful ability to express themselves both in speech and in writing. After the reading of passages from the Baha Writings, most interesting discussions would follow. 

 Almost invariably, someone would bring, of his own volition, a commentary he was inspired to write on some principle or aspect of the Cause. 

 We were fortunate in getting fine publicity early in the course of our work as one of the new believers was the owner and editor of the magazine, Alma Tica, (mean-ing  Costa Rican Soul), in which a section was devoted to the Baha'i Teachings in each edition. 

 Since the war, however, this publication  has been temporarily discontinued. 

 The group grew to the extent that the following year, 1941, when the time arrived for the formation of the Spiritual Assembly, there were twelve Costa Rican Baha'is to take part in the election. In a letter from Shoghi Effendi to the Spiritual Assembly of San Jos6, written December 17, 1941, by the Guardian's secretary, he said: (cYour Assembly  will go down in history as the first 

Baha'i Assembly in Central

 America, a great distinction and blessing, and the Guardian feels that if you continue to progress so rapidly you will soon be in a position to spread the Cause, through representatives of your Community,  in other neighboring lands. 

 This would be of great value to the work of teaching  these divine laws and truths, as then the Latin Americans would be hearing it from the lips of their own peopic, in their own language, which, of course, would be very effective." 

 The progress continued and in the following year on April 21, 1942, a Spiritual Assembly was formed in Puntarenas, a seaport on the Pacific side, in the province of that same name, another one of the seven provinces of Costa Rica, It was very interesting how this came about. Our one prized

  family of San Jos6 was visited by a son living in Puntarenas who was, as yet, unaware of the Teachings. 

 Upon being told of the Cause and reading some of the literature, he became aflame with ardor and devotion, finding, at last, that for Which his soul was thirsting. 

 He took Baha'i books and pamphlets back with him when he returned to Puntarenas and in his place of work, the custom house. during spare moments,  he would gather a few of his intimate friends, also employed in the Custom House or at the pier, and read the Teachings to them. He became the first Baha'i of Puntare-nas, and seven of the men were interested. They expressed a desire to form a study class. It was just at this tin-ic that the chairman of the San Jos6 Assembly was transferred to Puntarenas in his work, enabling him to help the new group with their meetings. 

 As Puncarenas is only a four hour train ride from San Jos6, I was able to visit them once a month. 

 These men all became Baha'is and with the transfer of the San Jos~ Baha'i making nine, the Spiritual Assembly was formed. 

 In June of that same year, the legal registration of the San Jos6 Spiritual Assembly with the Costa Rican Government was completed.  According to Costa Rican law, the San 

Jos~ Spiritual Assembly    

 is considered the mother Assembly in the country and any other Baha'i Assembly formed in Costa Rica becomes automatically incorporated under this registration. 

 In the second letter from the Guardian, through his secretary, to the Spiritual Assembly  of 

San Jos6, dated July       

 26, 1942, he said: "The progress which the Baha'is of Costa Rica have made during the past year is little short of astounding, and shows the deep receptivity the people of that country have to the New Message of 

God which Baha'u'llah     

 has proclaimed to the world. You must all indeed be both proud and grateful that you live in a land so tolerant of progress, and which enables you to establish the blessed institutions ordained by our Faith. 

 ccThe establishment of the new Spiritual Assembly of Puntarenas is a great step forward,  and the legal registration of the Cause and approval of the government marks a milestone in the progress of the Cause not only in Costa Rica but in 

Latin America.             

 "The more the Guardian receives news from the 

Central and South American 

 Republics,  the more firmly he becomes convinced of the great capacity possessed by the peoples of Latin America. They are proving themselves to be both deeply spiritual and intellectual, and he cherishes great hopes for their future development and their contributions to this glorious Faith of ours. 

 ctH wonderful that in iess than a hundred  years the message that originated in the heart of Persia should have spread to the heart of Central America, and kindled such love and devotion and hope as now burns in the hearts of the new believers in that distant continent! 

 ccThe Guardian hopes that you will not oniy succeed in establishing further centers in your own native land, but that the activities of the Costa Rican Baha'is will spread to neighboring countries and aid in the establishment  of the Faith there." 

 The Message has also penetrated into other provinces of Costa Rica. The Theosophical group of the province of Alajuela invited the Baha'is of San Jos~ to present the Teachings  at one of their gatherings. A group of thirteen Baha'is and friends made the trip and an interesting meeting was held. Much receptivity and enthusiasm was shown by the new listeners. 

 We left books and pamphlets to be circulated among them. 

 The ground of human hearts is so fertile now that wherever  a teacher would go and remain a while, a group would be easily established. There does not seem to be enough teachers to supply the demand of the spiritually hungry souis that arc craving Divine Light. 

 Our first Baha'i of Puntarenas had an experience  that resulted in the Message being taken into the Costa Rican province of Car-tago. 

 One day when he was at the pier in his city, he noticed that a man was watching him very intently. For several days, whenever  he saw that man, the man's eyes seemed to be fixed upon him. He inquired from among his friends who the man was and one said he thought he was a detective. This made our Baha'i quite indignant; why should he be watched by a detective, he was not guilty of any offense! 
One day the man


<p792>

  passed the Baha'is home and the two of them exchanged glances and an tCadios~~ the customary  greeting. 

 A few days later the man passed the house again. 

 Our Baha'i was in the parlor of his home which is built close to the sidewalk. 

 The window and door were opened so the man stopped and casually started a conversation. 

 Some Baha'i books on a table in the room caught his attention. "What kind of books are those?" 

 he asked. Our Baha'i, thinking that the man was checking up on him and perhaps suspected him of having some kind of literature which he should not have, proudly answered that it was religious literature. "May I see one of those books?" he requested. The Baha'i handed him one, and in his inner perturbation did not even notice which book it was. The man calmly and observingly turned the pages. 

 He then asked if he could buy the book. The Baha'i answered that he could borrow it and then if he felt he wanted it, he could have it. The man thanked him and took the book. 

 It was Baha'u'llah and the New Era. The Baha'i found out later that the man was not a detective but a guard at the pier and one whose soui thirsted for Divine Truth and he knew that our Baha'i had possession of some new religious teaching. 

 Every day for some days later, the Baha'i noticed that the man spent all his spare, mo —  ments at the pier in reading the book. After finishing it, the man asked for another, then another, having read in all, Baha'u'llah and the New Era, W/isdorn of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and Some 

Answered Questions. The    

 man later told the Baha'i that he was moving to the province of Cartago and that he wanted to take the books with him. Some time later he wrote asking for more literature and for pamphlets to give to his friends. He was referred  to me as it was more convenient to send literature from San Jos& His letter to me was very beautiful and unique in his inspired expressions of devotion for the Cause. 

 Here is a part of his letter translated into English: cdt was on the 20th of July of this year (1943) that, by coincidence, this Sacred, Unique and Unparalleled depository of 

Teachings, Baha'u'llah     

 and the New Era, came into my hands. I consider this date memorable, glorious as today I have nothing comparable; and for me it is an inexhaustible fountain of light, guidance, hope, certitude and assurance. 

 My ultimate, one and oniy resolution is the upholding of this Holy Cause." 

 In a letter which he wrote to our Baha'is of Puntarenas, he said: ttFor twenty-six  years I have dedicated my time to searching  and meditating on religious matter and never in my life have teachings like the Baha'i Teachings come into my possession. I am astonished, extremely satisfied and also always interested, but it is an interest which is well defined and without possibility of retrogression. In the reading, study and meditation of the Baha'i Teachings, I feel great joy and ecstasy; it is something supernatural indeed. 

 I feel the breath of the Holy Spirit in all my acts and occupations. 

 It is in truth something supernatural that moves me. I am, I can say, a new creature, glory and thanks be to God." 

 A very successful method used by the San Jos6 group to build up the meetings and make them better known was to occasionally invite some outstanding person of the city to be our speaker. We had such fine men as Professor Roberto Brenes Mesen, former professor  of Northwestern University and distinguished writer and poet; Mr. Joaquin Garcia Monje, owner and editor of the widely circulated literary magazine, Repertorio Americano, who has been very cooperative and generous in giving space for Baha'i articles and who is an Ex-Minister of Public Education in Costa Rica and a former director  of the Public Library, and has had the distinction of being invited by the League of Nations to visit Geneva; Professor Jose B. Acuna, one of Costa Rica's outstanding educators  and psychologists, who is now teaching at the Winona Teachers' 

College in Minnesota;     

 and Mr. Benjamin Odjo, lawyer, who also gave us his invaluable and generous assistance  in obtaining the legal registration of the Spiritual Assembly. 

 We deeply cherish the friendship of these kind friends and shall forever be grateful for their valuable help. 

 Visits from other pioneers are always very effective and helpful in the development of a group. It is hard to express how a pioneer thirsts for visits from fellow-pioneers while in those virgin and distant lands, especially when the Community is just a new one, and

  what a great joy, rare treat and fortification it is to see them, to talk with them, to derive the blessings of their association and assistance.  If oniy more would come! Pioneers who visited us in Costa Rica, in the order in which they came, were: Gerard Sluter, Marhew Kaszab, Cora Oliver, Louise Cas-well, Johnny Eichenauer and 

Virginia Orbi-son.  Gerard 

 Sluter visited San jos~ while on his way to Colombia from Guatemala, Mathew Kaszab came from Nicaragua, 

Cora Oliver and Louise     
Caswell from Panama, Johnny
Eichenauer from Salvador   

 after also having visited Honduras and Nicaragua, and Virginia Orbison visited us on her way to Chile from the United States. 

 Each has left his special contribution to the growth and strengthening of the 

Costa Rican Baha'i Community.
  The San Jos6 Community     

 is proud that two of its members have done pioneer work, Dr. David Escalante who cooperated with Mrs. 

Dorothy Baker in Venezuela 

 and Sr. Gerardo Vega who has assisted with the work in Panama. 

 It is such a great thrill and source of immeasurable joy to witness, through the wondrous  ways of God, the birth, establishment and growth of a Baha Community in a virgin land. Throughout every moment of activity, as one door of opportunity opens after another in the promotion of the Holy Cause of Baha'u'llah, the pioneer is always vividly aware of the miraculous and mysterious  workings of His Divine Spirit, aware of his own utter nothingness and of how he does nothing, that he is merely an instrument, a key in the Hands of the Great Door-Opener and that it is His Spirit and Power that do the work. 

 The interesting experiences, joys and blessings of pioneering are indeed abundant, and once a taste of pioneer service is had, it is like something that gets into one's blood and it does not seem possible to be content without it; and what is given and sacrificed, be it of oneself or any other contribution, is as nothing in comparison to what is received  in return, in both the spiritual and material sense of the word. It makes: us realize  that a mystery of sacrifice is that there is no sacrifice, as 'Abdu'l-Baha tells us. Of my many experiences, the following is one I shall always cherish. 

 One day in June, 1942, a Chinese family moved into an apartment  adjoining mine. The next day, as I heard one of my new neighbors walking in the corridor towards my front door, I, too, went toward the door to meet him. 

 My wide front door which gave entrance directly into the parlor was open, and there in the doorway stood a dignified Chinese gentleman; he was looking at the Greatest Name which was hanging on the wall facing the entrance. "You are a Baha'i!" were his first words as he shook my hand. CrJ am Mr. Z. T. Ing, the Chinese Consul of Nicaragua. This is the third rime I have seen this Baha'i symbol," continued the gentle, soft-toned visitor. "Ti first time was in China when I met a very friendly Baha'i teacher (regrettably, he could not remember her name), then once in the United States, and now here." He then went back to his apartment and brought his wife, a sweet, gracious lady who was dressed in a charming Chinese garb, and in introducing us, he said: "Mama, she is a Baha'i." They expressed an excellept opinion of the Baha'is. A few days later, after Mr. Ing had finished reading the Wisdom of 'Abdu'l-Baha, he said that the Baha'i Teachings  would find great receptivity in China as that is the way the Chinese think. 

 He had brought his family from Managua, Nicaragua, to San Jos6 to enjoy more comfortable  climate but his work called him back there. He would make occasional visits to San Jos6 and on one of these visits, when he was attending a Baha'i meeting, he made a beautiful statement about the Cause which thrilled and inspired us. He said ~ have faith in the Baha'i Religion because it is the essence  of all religions and the basis of it is that it accepts all races on an equal basis. It is something which meets with the needs of these times and it satisfies within. I firmly believe it will replace all the existing religions of the world and it will be The one Universal Religion for all." 

 During the stay of the family in San Jos6, we became very good friends and they were so kind, so hospitable and loving that I felt a part of them. They even gave me lessons in eating with chopsticks though I always ended up resorting to the fork if I wanted any nourishment.

  The way some of the believers are attracted  to the Cause is often reminiscent of The Dawn-Breakers and shows how many are long before prepared in the spirit to receive the Divine Message. One believer of San Josd had a dream seven years before she learned of the Cause in which she was sitting at the foot of a tree when a venerable figure of Oriental appearance, with a white beard and wearing a beautiful white turban approached her and handed her a tray on which were some exquisite fruit and a crystal pitcher of water. He spoke to her in her ear and as he did so she beheld a magnificent temple. 

 It was seven years later when her husband who was attending the Baha meetings brought home the Spanish version of the Wisdom of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and as she opened it and saw the picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha on the frontispiece, she recognized Him as the venerable figure in her dream. 

 The pioneer, besides enjoying the many happy experiences which flower his path, is faced with difficulties as well. One of these that came. my way was experienced when I received a cable from home notifying me of the grave illness of my mother and later of her passing. My family wanted me to come home but I did not feel I could leave my post. The situation was difficult because of very young brothers and sisters at home. 

 It was my sister Dahela who took over our mother's place with the family responsibilities, and though young herself, she valiantly shouldered her task. This enabled me to remain in Costa Rica and since then I have always rightfully referred to her as the "pioneer at home" as had it not been for her, I would not have been enabled to remain in the pioneer  field. It was soon after this that Mrs. Ford returned to the United States after a year and a half of devoted service. 

 My adventure in learning Spanish began upon my arrival in Costa Rica. 

 In fact, there is no better school for acquiring a foreign language than to be in the country where it is spoken. At first I attended the girls' college known as the "co1eg~o Superior de Senoritas" and although I did not receive struction in Spanish there, I went to be among the students to hear the language spoken by them and the teachers and to practice  by means of conversation with the girls. 

 It was a most delightful experience. Outside of school, I had a private Spanish teacher from whom I received two lessons a week. The following year I attended the newly inaugurated  University of Costa Rica. I made a special study of the verbs and concentrated much effort on learning the various conjugations. 

 In my conception, once the verbs are grasped, the rest in Spanish comes easily. It is a beautiful, rich language and a key for unlocking the treasures of the Latin American soui. 

 The Costa Ricans love the English language and many of them speak it. They are especially cager to study it with some one from North America so as to hear the American accent. It was shortly after I arrived  that I found myself with several students.  The number of students grew as time went on and eventually I was also able to give Spanish lessons to a few English-speak-ing students. This work was continued until I was employed as secretary and translator at the 

Pan-American Highway      

 Office which was set up in San Jos6. 

 While in Costa Rica, I met peopie from various Latin American countries, and it was interesting to note how those from different countries spoke Spanish with different inflections,  each having a typical melody peculiar to his country. One can recognize those from other countries by the "song" in their speech. When I visited Guatemala after learning Spanish in Costa Rica, I was amused when Guatemalans would say to me, "You come from Costa Rica, don't you?" They could tell, they said, because I spoke with the Costa Rican song. The people from Panama, 

Nicaragua, Guatemala      

 and Mexico, for example, have a very marked inflection. 

 It was a jubilant occasion when the delegate  of Costa-Rica  to the Centenary Convention  was informed by the National Spiritual Assembly that he would be enabled to go to the United States to attend that momentous  event. 

 He brought the letter to me to translate it for him and we could hardly believe it to be really true; we had not considered that such a great undertaking could be realized, making it possible for the Latin American delegates to attend that glorious celebration within-the walls of our majestic Temple. As we read this wonderful

  news, we were so overtaken by emotion and excitement, we did not know whether we were going to laugh or cry. Profound joy and gratitude filled our hearts. All the Latin American delegates must have felt that same emotion when they learned than an experience  that occurs once in a lifetime was to be theirs. Only the power of Baha'u'llah could accomplish such a great achievement, to bring together in love and unity representatives of these various Latin American countries with all those that would be gathered  in North America, breaking down the barriers of distance, language and lack of means and demonstrating that spiritual brotherhood which is the salvation of all nations. This undertaking had a great effect not only on the Baha'is of Latin America but also on the other Latin Americans who learned of it, making them realize more deeply the scope and power of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. 

 After four years in the wonderful country of Costa Rica, the time had come for my departure. It had been like going through four years of school, a school of life, to better enable mc to serve the Cause of God. The evening before I left, a happy close to my stay was occasioned by the one who was the first to open the doors to the Message in that country, Miss Esther Mezerville, a f or-mer director of the Girls' College and an outstanding member of the Theosophical Society not oniy in Costa Rica but in all of Latin America. 

 She told me that she was going to speak of the Baha'i Faith at their meeting that evening and so I attended. After the kind words of the president who spoke of the important work of the Baha'i Faith in 

Costa Rica, Miss Mezerville

 spoke of world unity as the sign and need of the times and said that in their endeavor to seek their ideal of world brotherhood, they must be alert to movements working toward unity in the world today. She then put emphasis on the great work of the Baha'i Faith in fostering unity among all religions and races, and stated, ttj am now reading Baha'u'llah and the New Era," as she drew the book out of her purse, "and I am ~pnvinced that the Baha'i Faith is the future religion of the world." She recommended the investigation of the Teachings to her fellow members. Her

 It was on April 18, 1944, that I left Costa Rica to spend three weeks in Guatemala City and then return to the United States. There were mixed emotions within me on that lovely bright morning as friends, both Baha'is and non-Bah&'is, gathered to see me off at the airport and showered me with gifts, bouquets and corsages. 

 The feeling of sadness on leaving these dearly-beloved friends was mingled with that of joy at Visiting  another

 On the way to Guatemala, the plane made a short stop at Nicaragua, Honduras and Salvador, and at each of these countries it was thrilling to have a brief visit with Baha'i friends who were waiting for me at the airport. 

 Every moment of my visit to Guatemala City with our wonderful pioneer, Mrs. Florence  Keemer, and the Guatemalan Baha'is was so filled with activity and glorious experiences that it, in itself, is a long story. Here is a beautiful, picturesque and colorful city; it is modern and sparkles with cleanliness.  The streets of Guatemala arc said to be the cleanest in the world. This beauty was glorified by its lovable people, equally as warmhearted, hospitable and gracious as those of Costa Rica. 

 Mrs. Keemer's radiant love and charm had won her many friends among whom there was an amazing receptiv ity to the Divine Teachings, and her excellent work was exemplified by the outstanding Baha'i group I was privileged to know and work with for that short period.

          FOUNDING THE FAITH IN PUERTO RICO

                   B~ AYNED MCCOMB

  PUERTO RICO is a tiny island less than one hundred miles Long and only about thirtyfive miles wide, set like a tropical jewel in the chain of other islands comprising the Greater Antilles of the 'West Indies. One shore faces the expanse of the Caribbean Sea, the other shore faces the broad splendor of the Atlantic Ocean, and mountains rise against the sky throughout the entire length of the interior. The refreshing trade winds, peculiar to the tropics, rustle the verdant flowering foliage and cause the many palm ttees to whisper gently in the sun. Puerto Rico was discovered on November  19, 1493, by Columbus while he was on his second voyage to the New World. This makes it the only bit of land now owned bythe United States, upon which Columbus ever set foot. Juan Ponce de Le6n was its first Governor after he had conquered it for Spain :j~ 1509. From then until the year 1898 Puerta Rica was ruled by Spain and many times during that period had to defend itself against foreign ships and pirates. 

 In 1898 after the close of the Spanish American War, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris but it was not until 1917 that Congress granted full American citizenship to all natives of the 

Island.                    

 San Juan, the capital city, was founded in 1521 and is the second largest city in the entire West Indies. San Juan is both the seat of government and the heart of all commercial  and intellectual pursuits throughout the Island. The people today arc mostly a mingling of Spanish, Negro and Carib Indian,  although there are still many of the white race only. 

 There are also some families of German, French, Dutch and Syrian strains. Spanish is the first, and preferred language, but English is a second tongue with many people.

  tiquity began over four hundred years ago, but the greatest event in its spiritual history began quite recently, and without the knowledge  of most of the inhabitants. April 2 1st, 1943, was the date of this significant event which marked the establishment of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'i 

Faith in Puerto Rico.      

 These first spiritually awakened souis of the Island set about to achieve the spiritual conquest of a wilderness of age-old tradition and prejudice, even as the early explorers had sought to conquer her lands. 

   The Community of Baha'is   

 of Puerto Rico is growing in numbers and in influence. Through an increasing distribution of the literature of the Faith and recently from new opportunities of radio, the knowledge is reaching out to plant within the hearts of many peopic the vision of a new life. 

 It is interesting to note that the Island of Puerto Rico is an offshore possession of the United States, and under the Baha'i administrative order the teaching work is advanced  under the direction of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, as is the case with Alaska or Hawaii. It differs, however, in one important respect, for Puerto Rico is Spanish in speech, in custom  and tradition, and its inhabitants are Latin Americans whose culture traces back to Spain. 

 In carrying on the teaching work the scope of literature has therefore been confined to available Spanish translations. 

 The future is bright for all the world and Puerto Rico will enjoy her full share of its brightness. 

 World wide air travel will bring to every remote corner the opportunity to advance and progress. 

The Baha'is of Puerto Rico 

 stand ready, along with their fellow believers throughout the world, to help in the fulfillment of the spiritual destiny that must mark the progress of human civilization in every land.

          THE FOUNDING OF THE BAHA'{ FAITH
                    IN VENEZUELA

                 B~ ELISABETH CHENEY

  A ST HE Faith spreads from land to land following in the wake of those intrepid pioneer  teachers whose mission thus becomes immortal, it is with deep appreciation that one considers the advent of Miss Priscilla Rhodes who went to Venezuela in 1940 and has remained making her permanent home there after several years as a successful business  woman. 

 After Miss Rhodes, Mr. and Mrs. Emeric Sala of Toronto, Canada took up their residence  in Caracas where they made many friends and with great tact and assurance continued to advance the Faith until they were obliged to return to Canada. 

 In 1942 another pioneer teacher, Miss Gwenne Dorothy Sholtis, spent some months in Caracas leaving an indelible imprint upon the lives of many of its citizens by her valiant efforts, though laboring under serious  conditions of ill health. During her resi dence in Caracas Miss Sholtis' tiny apartment was the center for teaching activities where Baha'i hospitality and loving service drew many to hear of the Faith as she prepared the way for future teachers. 

 Although grieved to leave the field where she bad reached so many hearts she was comforted by the assurance that Srta. L6onor Morin had become completely confirmed and was like a brilliant candle held aloft to welcome Mrs. Dorothy Baker of Lima, Ohio who reached Caracas after some weeks spent with her daughter in Colombia where they were both engaged in energetic teaching work. 

 Mrs. Baker found only a small group gathered to hear her at her first meeting and the prospect seemed to presage a long period of patient effort but her time was somewhat limited and she ardently besought divine aid in a night of discouragement. The next morning Sra. Trina de Courlaender, who was

  a friend of Miss Sholtis and had been advised of Mrs. Baker's coming, telephoned her to invite her to a meeting of the 

"Union de Las Mujeres      

 Americanas" of which Sra. de Courlaender was president and founder. 

 Mrs. Baker found there a group of some thirty outstanding Venezuelan women who were working for the advancement of all women m their country. 

 Mrs. Baker accepted the invitation with pleasure oniy to find on her arrival that she was the honored guest, that special entertainment had been prepared and that a group of children had gathered to recite and dance for her. There was some speech making and a number of newspaper reporters appeared to interview her while a lovely young sefiorita, Mercedes Bermudas, presented to her a beautiful bouquet of roses and orchids. 

 To all requests for interviews Mrs. Baker stated only that she was "encantada" (de-lighted)  with everything, but the reporters, catching the joyousness of Mrs. Baker's attitude  expanded their reports with many complimentary remarks about the whole affair  which appeared in the next day's papers. So successful was the meeting that it became the fashion to ask those who had met Mrs. Baker, "Do you think you could get me an invitation to one of Sra. Baker's meetings?" 

 As a result, in the closing weeks of her stay in Caracas the meetings grew from three or four students to an attendance of about forty and when she departed in March she

 Left ten declared Baha'is in Caracas, nine adults and one youth. In addition to Miss Rhodes and Srta. 

 L6onor Morin these included Dr. David Escalante, Dr. Ren6 Escalante  and his wife, Sra. Violeta de Escalante,  Sra. Trina 0. de Courlaender, Sra. Lulu de Serrano, Sra. Maria de Rodriguez and her daughter, Srta. Maruja Rodriguez, fifteen  years of age, and Sra. Rosita Madero de Bennett. As Dr. David Escalante was soon to return to Honduras where his home was established, no permanent Assembly could be formed but since that time Venezuela has been added to the list of South American countries where Spiritual Assemblies exist. 

  Dr. David Escalante was elected to represent the Venezuelan Baha'is at the Centenary  celebration in Wilmette and he had definitely  planned to visit Chicago and attend the ceremonies. However at the last minute he was unable to secure the necessary visa. At the second meeting, when representatives from other Latin American countries who had been unable to reach Chicago in time for the Centenary, were guests of the National  Spiritual 

Assembly in Wilmette       

 in July, 1944, Sra. de Courlaender had been clected representative, but she too, was prevented  from attending because of illness so that Venezuela, unfortunately, was not represented  at those historic meetings. 

 The next visitor to Caracas was Miss Elisabeth Cheney of Lima, Ohio, who arrived in December, 1944, for a six weeks' sojourn while enroute to other South 

American countries.  During

 Miss Cheney's visit many 799 meetings were held and seven new Baha'is accepted the Faith, six of these being adults and one a declared youth. These included Sra. Yolanda L. de Stronach, Sra. 
Mercedes de Su~rez, Srta.  
Mercedes Entrena, Srta.    

 Mary Gim6nez, Srta. Maria Antonia Aguilera Or-sini, 

Sra. Ermelinda de Estrena  

 and Sra. Myriam Rodriguez Paredes, the last being also a youth member. This increased the number of registered Baha'is to sixteen, fourteen  being adults and two declared youths. 
  According to the Baha'i    

Administrative Procedure   

 Assemblies are organized oniy on April 21st of any year, but by permission of the Inter America Committee the friends were permitted to form an administrative body for the purpose of gaining experience which would prepare them to function regularly  when a Spiritual Assembly should be elected in April. 

 In addition to those who had already accepted the Faith a class of some twenty-five students attended the meetings, of whom five verbally declared their faith in Baha'u'llah at the closing meeting of January 8th, 1945. These declarations were lovingly and joyously received and after having attended six meetings and received personal instruction they will be formally received into the Baha'i Community. 

 The sixteen registered believers were in each case those who had been reached either by Gwenne Sholtis or Mrs. Baker. Thus do the seeds planted by the loyal and devoted pioneer teachers ultimately bear fruit!

  Reproduction of the commemorative stamp, issued in 1944, honoring the centenary of the first official telegraphic message~~R(That Hath God Wrought" — sent on May 24, 1844, from Baltimore to Washington. 

  The stamps commemorating three significant  technological achievements in the field of communication bore the following captions: (1)    The first steamship to cross the Atlantic, 18 191944 (2)    Centenary of the Telegraph, 18441944 (3)     Completion of the first Transcontinental Railroad, 18691944 The years 1819, 1844, 1869 and 1944 have historical and social significance to the people of the United States of America; but in addition, the dates listed have been assoct-atcd with profound spiritual values which are cherished everywhere by Baha'is who are the believers of the World Faith of 

Bah~'-u  '11Th.            

 The important historical events designated may be briefly noted. (1) The 18191944 stamp commemorates the accomplishment of an American sailing packet, Savannah, which was fitted with boiler and engine. Reaching Europe in 1819, the Savannah was the first vessel in the world to venture onto the open ocean using steam power. She became  the forerunner of the modern palatial ocean steamers. 

 (2)     The 18441944 stamp commemorates the achievement of Samuel F. B. Morse who demonstrated the practical application of the power of electricity in the rapid trans —  mission of information from Baltimore to Washington. On May 24, 1844, a young woman sent the first official message: CtWWhat Hath 

God Wrought?"              

 (3)     The 18691944 stamp commemorates the junction of the Union Pacific with the Central Pacific 

Railroad at Promontory Point.

 The event marked the conquest of territorial distances, the distribution and utilization of national resources, the eradica-don of social distances and the establishment  of national solidarity and unity. 

 The Baha'is throughout the world are interested also in the contemporaneous events in the spiritual realm decreed by God for this Dispensation.

  (1)     On October 20, 1819, Mirza. 'Au Muhammad, later known as the BTh, which means "Gate," was born in Shiriz,

 On that eventful day, in Tihrin, Persia, was born 'Abdu'l-Baha, the son of Baha'u'llah.  He was destined to share the Father's hardships, to receive the mantle of spiritual authority, and to become the Center of the

 Within the brief duration of time, 18441944,  are distinctly silhouetted the outlines of institutions — divinely ordained and spiritually implemented — which are functioning according to the divine pattern designed by Baha'u'llah, the Father. God's Kingdom on earth as promised by Jesus Christ has come. "Thy Will be done on earth as it is in heaven" has become a reality which awaits mankind's awareness and participation in the dynamic process. Baha'u'llah has said: "0 people!

       INTRODUCTION               

  Sometimes the hand of God is terrible, And sometimes good. 

 But always it is shaping unto a destined end, With Mind beyond our keen imaginings, This mass of fluid, magic stuff We call humanity. 

  — 1 —  — And now the day of fear has come; The great terror stalks the earth. 

 Men gkulk in shrub and bush And cast their eyes to heaven And watch with tight-held breath The moving shuttles in the blue As    destruction weaves its pattern o'er the earth. 

  The women bear their babies in the subways, Huddle with their brood in caves, Paw through the wreckage of a house To find memento of a wedding Of an early married day, Of a    parent lost in time — in place — in feeling, Of a childhood book, of a playfellow, Of some proud, safe moment. 

  Men are at bayonet drill; The factories hum; The camps flourish; Men march and countermarch; The motors roar; Assembly lines are speeded up; Ships plow the deep in convoy brood; The    women knit and wind up long gauze rolls. 

  For    the destruction that wasteth by noonday  is on you, And    the evil that striketh by night smites at your doors; The flame of your culture licks at your cities, Blasting your dreams and your genius, Blighting the toddling child and the withered crone, And the earth cries out in its anguish, Yearning to cast its great burden. 

  The orators orate, they rant, they roar; They puff their cheeks and bellow into microphones And    point accusing finger at their fellowmen. 

 Each is guiltless and omnipotent; I — us stand is righteous, others wrong. 

 The air is full of charge and countercharge And words blight the ear And stun the eye And deepen men's confusion; And through the interlocking days and nights Men work bedeviled by a passion Born when plane first dived And killed a child And    sent a woman screaming down a rubble-studded street And left a nun white-lipped and shaking, Staring at a void as black and deep As ever poet painted hell. 

  — 2 — How sweet the earth before this quake had come! 

 How beautiful the flowers in valley and on mountainside! 

 How numerous the works of genius! 

  The quiet of cathedral nave, the clean sweep and rise of gothic stone and rib meeting in the dimness overhead, light streaming through the multicolored glass.

The quaint old cities, little shops with tinkling bell above the door, bookstalls by the river, boats on the canals, slow-turning windmills on a still, still day, beer gardens and gay music, narrow cobbled streets with houses leaning overhead. 

 The cities of the warm sun, glory of Naples from volcano's top, silver and blue of the grotto, crumbling coliseum, frescoes and mosaic and smooth marble, silent gondolas and voice of song across the water. 

  The ships in the great harbors of the world, boats on the mighty rivers —  Yangtze and the Nile, Platte and Mississippi, The cargoes on these ships, silks and teas, machines and metals, hemp and wool and rice, the stuff of homes and life. 

 The work done on these cargoes, plans of engineers, rivets and plates of steel, great engines and churning wheels, produce of the farm and forest, the factory and the deep, the work of many bands and backs, and legs and hearts and brains, all climes and colors, all nations and all creeds. 

  — 3 —  — Now let the pompous music play "With a pace that's stately, slow! 

 Now let the drums be muffled As they roll in solemn beat! 

 Hang out the crepe, dark symbol of men s mourning! 

 Let all the flags at half-mast bel For a world lies dead before us Prostrate in the ruin at our feet. 

  — 4 — Hail you mighty men of arms, all hail! 

 Rider of the whirlwind, bail! 

 Blazing comet of a world's night, all hail! 

 Your snorting monsters h&ve defied the snows and rains; They've driven 'cross the plains and laid the mountains low; You glanced upon vast cities and they shook with fear; You spoke, and millions fled the words you uttered; The walls of homes split, The streets cracked, and the bowels of the city were laid open; All this — all this — at your command. 

  The slut of the market place shouts in her glee; The puny little men, the potbellied men, The whining simp, the puling coward, The men with warped and sunless souls, They shout for you, They shriek, They pledge allegiance. 

  Come out on the balcony and show yourself To these — the willing ones. 

 Stand on a crag in Norway, Ply o'er the tulipped lowlands, Gaze from the top of Liffel Tower, Stand defiantly upon Olympus, borne of faded gods. 

  You are the god of the beast-man. 

 In all ages have you lived, in every clime. 

 But god that you are, conqueror though you be, You bear no name, You have no titles, no abode, no issue; You are the bitter frenzy of a passing dream, The conjured shape of men's debauchery; You were not of woman born, But sprang from hatred's dragon teeth. 

  And when the crowds acclaim you, When they shout in frenzied worship, It is not you they cry for, It is not you that they exalt, It is themselves! 

 Their hatred they have deified, You're only symbol of it; You're the cruelty of little boys torturing a rabbit in the woods. 

  The evil things that men have dreamed, The things of earth and nature's blindness,


<p807>
The blisters on the ignorant soui, The festering sores of organs not in unity, The pus of ill health, and the tainted blood; Of these you are the symbol. 

  — 5 — How fallen are the mighty in these days! 

 The kings scurrying like rats for a friendly hole. 

 Where are their ermine and their gilded thrones? 

 Where the lush whores and the fawning mendicants? 

 The rich dandies with bewildered eyes, Fear stabbing at their withered hearts? 

 The great men of finance in flight Clutching at their bags of gold? 

 The cosmopolitans who roamed the earth, With no allegiance to country, people, or to God? 

 The men of letters from their nice retreats? These planets jarred from snug, accustomed orbits Are sent crashing through the awesome space. 

  — 6 — Destiny is in the saddle Riding down the wind of time. 

  The hooves of his charger bite deep in the earth. 

 He crosses the boundaries, mountains and seas. 

 He strikes at the cities, even the hamlets, Scorching the earth and dark'ning the sky. 

 No spot is sacred, too remote; No people free from punishment. 

  He stops but in the market place To reign his charger in And look upon the gods That men have set up there. 
Three gods he sees.        

 The objects of men's worship and their sacrifice: The god of nation — proud, disdainful holding in hairy hand a bloody sword; The god of race — a leering beast, blind of eye, covered with red, running sores; The god of godlessness — deity of self and all men's evil, sanctioner of the dungeon and the poisoned 

 CUp.                       

 To these for years have men paid homage, Bringing for the sacrifice The fruits of harvest and the product of the mill. 

 The men of slender body, blue eyed and golden haired, Pledged their fealty even unto death, And maidens gave their virgin worth With joy and due humility. 

 The scholar and the man of wealth, The businessman and artisan —  All labored for the gods which they bad made. 

  And in the market place when Destiny has stopped, He's laughed a hard and mocking laugh And raised aloft a mighty arm To crush in shapeless clay the little deities. 

 In every hamlet, every city, every land, He's left behind a murky gloom That's settled o'er the people like a heavy shroud. 

  Destiny is in the saddle Riding down the wind of time, And the voice of God roars with him, Roaring through the dark'ning air, Challenging the puny men Who have turned their backs on Him, Challenging the evil men Who promote their dark designs, Pronouncing doom upon the nations, And the worshippers of earth-made gods. 

  Destiny is in the saddle And he bears avenging sword. 

  — 7 — Men have sat in pleasant philosophic mood, In teacup attitude, in cloistered self — assurance, And intoned pedantically, ttYea we are God! 

 In every one of us some shining bit of Essence is. Divine we are. One with the Maker. 
 He in us. We create with   

God.                       
 Without us He is nothing." 

  You stupid little men! 

 Stir up the atoms in your old bald heads! 

 In what military god is Essence true?


<p808>
In what plunderer, what blighter of a nation's soul? 

 Does God decree the flame of hatred in the hearts? 

 By what subtle reason do you come at this? 

  What fragment of Divinity in power politics, in gangs of hired henchmen in economic war, in frockcoar prostitution of the people's faith, in intellectual disdain of lower, classes, in ownership of tenement, in exclusive set and little favored circle, in the sly doctors of abortion, in the selfish pillars of the local good? 

  As bats do iove the darkness, So men love themselves; They love each sinew, bone and tendon, each nerve cell and each drop of blood; And they fight to make the world safe for themselves, not others; They plot and scheme and organize to make the world reflect themselves, their bones, their sinews, and their own bad blood. 

 And when the time of war and crisis comes, They do not blame themselves, They blame some other man, Some man who does the same thing that they do. 

  0   can't you see, you paltry little men, That you are each a drop in one great sea, That you are each a leaf upon a great green tree, That    you are only twigs and branches of that tree? 

 What right has drop to rule the ocean's surge? 

 What right has drop to cleave the seas, disdaining half as being of an impure kind? 

 What right has leaf to shake his fellow from the branch? 

 What right has twig to warp the natural growing of the tree? 

 You    little drop — did you create the ocean s surging tides? 

 You    little leaf — did you put color in yourself? 

 And    twig upon that tree — please tell me how you made yourself, For    I would know the secret of your arrogant  and godlike right. 

 The    rhythms of the world do not depend on man. 

 The    typhoon does not ask the tree before uprooting it. The    first man was not asked if he desired creation. 

 God    does not inquire: "Little man, will you have it thus, or so?" 

  But men project their will into the universe And hope to shape it. And when the universe rejects disdainfully Their vaunted hope and arrogance, They cavil at the God who made them, And so mercifully has laid them bare; They fly at neighbors' throats And sink beneath the level of the wolf, And fear is rampant in the streets, Terror stands grinning at the windowpane, Destruction is pronounced in solemn tones From radio and pulpit, Men    sicken in their stomachs and women cry, Children tremble and old ones wish a speedy passing; For    this must be whenever men create gods in the image of themselves. 

  — 8 — A A world is passing. 

 Let it pass And do not weep or mourn. 

 Shed not a tear for things destroyed. 

  If you must weep, Weep then for men and not for monuments. 

 The past is being blotted out, The world of man and worship of the self; The world of man's desire And all the conflicts that arise When human will is made The measure of all worth. 

 This, all this is gone, Cleansed by a mighty wind That's rocked the planet in a frenzied gale. 

  And now that monuments are gone, Men can lift their eyes Above the valley floor


<p809>
To the clear blue of heaven, Symbolic of the unknown 

God                        

 Within Whose Mind, past fathoming, This planetary speck was given shape, Infused with meaning, And set upon its course. 
                           
            — 9 — Take                  
Take a map up in your hand.
  What do you see?           

  Plains and valleys cleady marked, Peaks and rivers, lakes and swamps, Cities, villages and towns, Naval bases, points of strategy, Latitude and longitude, Torrid zone and temperate, arctic too, Boundaries and capitals, Different colors here and there upon the continents. 

  Yes, but is this all? 

 Can't you also see upon the map The living heart of all humanity On this planetary scroll? 

  The busy city streets with the blaring traffic horns, the officer with whistle and an upraised hand, the jostling throngs at noontide and the emptiness at night, screaming ambulance and small delivery truck. 

 The stray farm on the grassy plain, with windmill standing guardian and knot of trees to shade it from the sun, the flowers nursed in garden and in window  box, the gay chintz and the bright carpet, the picture on the calendar of waterfall in magic land. 

 The small flat in the city, the lunch box on the table, the crumpled evening paper by the easy chair, the soft light in a bedroom where a baby lies. 

 The factory with the dull brick walls, noise surging through the dusty air, the turning wheels and endless belts, and the constant, constant clang of pistons full of power. 

 The schoolboy with his books and a heart of pure romance, half formed smile upon his lips at the instance of the teeming pictures in his brain. 

  These are the things upon the map If you read its signs aright. 

 Human beings are the treasures of the earth; They alone can glimpse the one reality And show it forth In simple ways and great. 

  Let the statues fall into the dust, Let the stupid slogans ring Until their falsity is manifest; Human life has destiny Which no glittering force can thwart; It will know the rightful way Even though a host of men and the armies of the world Pillage, burn and rape. 

  — 10 — What apathy upon your souL, old men? 

 Has the world grown too rapidly, Gigantic, Too confusing, Full of rush and noise and constant prattle? 

  Are the eyes dimmed? 

 The eyes that saw a continent spanned by steel rails, The eyes that looked to heaven and saw rockets in the blue. 
Are the ears dull?         

 The ears that caught the snap of twig on forest trail, The ears that heard in wilderness the song of millions freed. 
Are the feet weary?        

 The feet that crossed the prairie, searched out mines in desert waste, The feet that rested by the campfires under sparkling, crackling stars. 
Are die arms grown weak?   

 The arms that cleared the forest and hewed the cabin logs, The arms that held the plow and threshed the golden wheat.


<p810>
Is the heart faint?        

 The heart that saw but triumph in the momentary plight, The heart that beat so steady when disaster shed its gloom. 

  Is nothing left to do? 

 Has life run its course and now the night? 

 I say we have but started on the road, Our feet have merely touched the pungent soil, Our hands have fashioned but the crudest things, Our brains not started yet to think, Our hearts have known but adolescent pang; The false dawn only have we known, And all the glories that we fondly think upon Are but a prelude to the greater dreams, Are only curtain to the vaster deeds, The mighty triumph of a race That has but started to achieve its destiny. 

  Think back, old men, and you can see The stormy tortuous way that man has trod. 

 You huddled once in damp and musty cave; Your hair was matted, full of lice and dirt; Your eyes had gleam that was companion to the beasts; You hunted for a hairy raiment And a coverlet at night; You talked in grunts And knew no gentleness nor honor; Your offspring scrambled for the meat you brought; You taught them only how to shoot the bow, to skin the animals they killed, and how to war upon their fellowmen; And when you weakened you were cast aside, And others went to hunt and shared the womenfolk. 

  Low — browed savage that you were, Stinking dweller in a cave, In fear of lighv'ning and the flood, Peopling the forests and the streams with demons You allayed by charm and sacrifice, You did not stop at level of the beast; You grew beyond the early monkey grunts. 

  There was an urge that would not let you be; It fired all your atoms, stirred your blood; You learned to speak, You saw the value of the fire, You made a clumsy wheel, You fashioned clay utensils, And with crude design you painted Record of your life, your hopes and fears. 

  You grew from family into tribe, From tribe to village and to city-state, And from the city-state emerged the nation; And now you face the dire necessity Of consummating all your upward striving By establishing, for yourselves and your posterity, An Order for the World! 

  From the cradle where the race began You pushed across the mountains and the seas, In wave succeeding wave you peopled all the earth; The sun blackened your skin, The arid places bronzed your bodies, The frosty lands have bleached your countenance; But sure and steady was the force That marked your siow ascent. 

  Some men grumbled, many died, Others tried to plant their feet Across the path of destiny. 

 They shouted loud into the willing ears, ~'This is the end. This our place. 
We are emergent now, victorious.

 This is our destiny in full. 

 Let us enjoy it. Nothing more can come. 

  Poor criers of a world's false dawn! 

 The upward surge of humankind ascendant Has trampled you and all your kind, Has laid your glory and your gain In dusty books on history shelf. 

  — 11  — We are the men who slew the fairest of our kind To please a grinning, stone-faced god our fathers carved. 

 We are the men who thrilled to tom-tom beat And listened in the heavy jungle night for the distant thudding sound that changed us into throbbing savages.


<p811>
We are the men who once drew magic circles And knelt iow before the scented flame. 

 We are the men who once ducked women in a pond And tried the witches in a solemn court. 

  We are the men who spoke in pompous pageantry, Perpetuating pagan rite, adulterating truths for lust of power. 

 We are the men who walked our righteous way With minds turned backward to the sentimental  glow that covers all the triteness and shortcomings of the past. 

  We are the men who talked of promised lands But dared not change the old accustomed way. 

 We are the men who heard the Prophets speak, Then slew Them, for They glorified us not. 

  The past we fondly looked upon, The rites we used as camouflage for thought, The magic words that slipped so glibly from the tongue, Have now betrayed us. The changing rhythm of the spheres Has brought at last the time When we must learn the greater measure of a man, When we must substitute the fact For ideologies that feed upon Our past mistakes and littleness. 

  Although we are the men of pagan time Who burned books, hunted witches, feared advance of truth, We have within us latent loyalty To our common God-creator And to universal right. 

  We bear a common oneness in our blood, Denying color line and social caste. 

 We owe a common debt to all the Prophets, Fearless Men, Who saw the glorious vistas man could reach, Who inspired the saint, the poet and-the  painter, Who put a kindliness in hearts of unknown lesser men. 

  — 12 — Tbe flaming winds of sorrow with their piercing blasts, The gripping fears which shatter all the idols in the heart, These cleanse, These purge, These purify, And make the molten steel of faith Which God pours, living red, Into the mold of His ordained desire. 

  And still the Hope arises —  It cannot be crushed. 

 Again the Voice resounds —  It will be heard. 
It will be heard.          

 The Voice of God cries out. 

 The stones proclaim it. The atoms in our bodies, The motes in shafts of sunlight, The drops in all the seas of all the world —  The universe proclaims the birth of justice. 

  — 13  — 0  Whitman, fling me your pen! 

 For here is a song that must be sung, For here is a cause that needs a champion, For here is a glory that has dawned! 

  o  precious world! 

 o  planet filled with signs of God, Studded with beauty, Whirling through space propelled by breath of heaven! 

  o  human ones! 

 You of tenderness and cunning mixed, You of bodies built in perfect symmetry. 

 You of minds so capable, Yet strangely, strongly fettered, You of souls denied, of souls sleeping Because you are enamoured of a lesser dream Suited best for weaklings and for crones —  Hark you, to my song! 

 Hark to my song, my song and your song also! 

  o  Whitman, fling me your pen, I beg! 

 O  Holy One of Heaven, infect my blood


<p812>
And let a glorious madness seize my brain That all my atoms, all my limbs and powers May thrill in rapture to this coining birth! 

  — 14 — After these tears Will come the calm again; After this drought, the healing rain. 

 This hate must run its course, Disease must have its day, The    sickness must be burned from politic. 

 hod y The fever and the nightmare. 

 The twinge and stab of pain, The sucked-in breath of anguish, The burning forehead and the quaking of the limbs Are sign that unseen universal forces Have rallied for the healing of the nations And of man. 

  The small of Vi on. and constricted heart 

Are smitten —  Money-grubbers

 a~d begetters of ill-fame, The weak and whining, the timid ones, The near of sight and the lovers of antiquity, The men and women who believe the universe Is  centered in one continent, in one country, in one state, in one city, town or village, in one race, one church, one clique; These shall suffer illness Like the tortures of the damned. 

  These shall be shocked, affronted, dumbfounded, amazed, stirred, shaken, By the sweeping force of humankind Emerging from its chrysalis, By disaster's cleansing fire, As the foibles and the follies of the past Arc burned away. 

  Pity then the blind of heart Until these tears have passed. 

 Patient be with little men Till their puberty is done, And the pangs of adolescent surge, The frustrations of a world divided, Have been welded into peace and justice, With humanity at last mature. 

 Long may be the night and cold, The wind may lash with fury As to shake the stoutest heart; We may see great trees uprooted And mighty rivers cut new channels On the surface of the globe. 

  Let it be — and welcome. 

 This is the greatest moment in man's history; Unless these tears be shed, the heart is hard; Unless the sky rains fire, the mind unthinking Pursues its rutted, uncreative way; Unless foundations crumble, Men will not stir to build a world Befitting their true destiny. 

  — 15 — This is the nightmare of the soul, The bitter bed of pain on which we toss, Seeing the past in mockery flit in chaotic stream. 

 This is the deepest point of valley floor, The dark, foreboding walls of granite hem us in, Bin forward through the gloom, the chaos, and the night, We walk with steady feet. 

  Nor war, nor pestilence, Nor pen, nor sword, nor ioss of family or friend, Nor ravage of the beast that dwells so deep within us each, Can stay the forward movement Through the blackness of the night. 

  Though the ear be dulled to sound, There's a singing in the soul: Though the mind too stunned to think, We can grasp unconsciously What the heart begins to sense As we move through unknown paths. 

  The rhythm of the world is changed. 
The savage man is doomed. 

 On the anvil of our God, Creator of the universe and man, We are being forged and shaped For the birth of fitter race, A race of men who will make the earth Habitation for the human man,


<p813>
VERSE                    813

  Who    shall proclaim through continents and seas, The oneness of all humankind, The unity of all mankind at last mature. 

  We shall forge a planetary scheme To unite the nations of the globe, Disdaining differences Of sex, and race, and region; 'We shall scrap the silly creeds Wbich have kept us far apart; We shall speak one universal tongue; We    shall know the highest, fairest human loyalty, The loyalty of man to God, And love of human being for his kind. 

  The earth is pregnant, And she bears a burden great. 

 We of the new race — the lovers of all men —  We arc the burden living through travail. 

  So let the night be dark, The feet will never falter; Let the din increase, The mind will grow more clear; As the pain grows sharper, The    heart will beat with a steady, steady throb, feeling the rapture of the hand of God, sensing the glory of the world to be, that is nearer than our breath or our pulsing veins, feeling the stature of the race so great, of the mind so keen and the vision clear, that is decreed by God as our destiny —  now — in the world's rebirth.

  You are the Great Initiate of Light That we, in folly, darkness call. 

 You take us and tired day, within your arms Like children weary of their play And you enfold our littleness with love, Love that is peace, and poetry and power! 

 For in your hands you hold the singing stars, The light of all those distant worlds Grows visible a love in your deep eyes And you have knowledge of their inner flame, That immortality that floods the heavens "With happiness, with song, with Light! 

 Ab, we within your arms asleep Can only rest and dimly dream Of that vast peace and love in space That with the sign of silence — you impart.

  We wandered in perpetual night Without a star, without a moon, The Sun from which men drew their light Was hid in clouds themselves had wrought. 

 The earth was dumb and still and stark. 

 Oh, star, for which the wise men sought. 

 'Was there not once a promise made That He would come when night was dark? 

 Are we betrayed, are we betrayed? 

  In other lands and other skies Lived Eastern Christs, as well-beloved As our own Christ, the 

Jewish Lord.              

 Their light gave knowledge to the wise They, too, had strange symbolic birth And lived and died and rose again. 

 And left with men their holy Word. 

 Praise be to God that He has left His fingerprints on all the earth! 

 Yet still our brothers weep, bereft (cTh gold has gone from that gold story We, too, have lost the heavens' glory." 

  I have a secret I must tell For it bursts my breast with its bursting bell, When night was blackest and most men slept The promise given was kept, was kept. 

 He    shook the earth with His thunderous tread And stirred the living and moved the dead, Who rose from their self-wrapped winding sheet, At the thud of His sounding shattering Feet. Though the whole earth shivered, scarce one knew why Scarce any knew when the Lord went by. Oh, stars that fell in the black, black night And lightless moon — now rich with light,

  Behold! the carnival is over! 

 The revelling and feasting's done! 

 The vineyards burned, the fleshpots empty, The Age is wasted like a sun! 

 Beneath the gaunt and gaping roofs Its multicolored gauds of lust Like bits of stained confetti, lie Dispersed and scattered in the dust! 

 The empty couches, jeweled thrones, The palaces and perilous dreams —  All, all have been laid waste forever Beneath the Day's uprooted beams! 

 The captains of command are vanquished, Dust are the hands of tyranny; And kings and princes flee and vanish Like chaff before the Lord's decree! 

 Ye poor and needy of all nations, Ye tricked and taunted of the earth, See ye not your suff'rance is accomplished, Another Era comes to birth? 

 Behold! beyond the ruthless carnage, Beyond the spoil and the rage, Your blood has stormed the gates of Heaven And brings to birth the

  Dreamers we want, dreamers with dreams for our time! 

 Dreamers we want, dreamers with daring sublime! 

 Who stand where the bars of the world interpose And legions are ready to slay and oppose —  Take rancor, if need be, take malice, take slight But plead on for Justice and strive on for Right! 

  Dreamers we want, dreamers, defiers of bars! Dreamers we want, dreamers, outsoarers of stars! 

 Who bend not for glory and bow not for gain, But break thru all ranges and reaches amain —  Take burning, take branding, take blame evermore But lead forth the nations from bondage of war!
